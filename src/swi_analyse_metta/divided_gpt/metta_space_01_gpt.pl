 * Project: MeTTaLog - A MeTTa to Prolog Transpiler/Interpreter
 * Description: This file is part of the source code for a transpiler designed to convert
 *              MeTTa language programs into Prolog, utilizing the SWI-Prolog compiler for
 *              optimizing and transforming function/logic programs. It handles different
 *              logical constructs and performs conversions between functions and predicates.

% Directive to set the environment variable 'RUST_BACKTRACE' to 'full' to enable complete backtraces during debugging.

% The following line is commented out since it duplicates the previous directive.
% This line was not removed to preserve the intention of loading the compiler, but since the loading occurs in the line above, this is unnecessary.
% If this were uncommented, it would reload the 'metta_compiler', which could be redundant or lead to unnecessary overhead.
