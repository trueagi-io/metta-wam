   "The SingularityNET daemon is a sidecar proxy deployed alongside an AI service to interface with the SingularityNET platform.
It handles payment authorization and request translation for the service. The daemon interacts with the Multi-Party
Escrow contract to authorize payments and ensures that payment channels have sufficient funds. It validates requests,
translates them into the service's expected format, and proxies them to the service. The daemon also provides additional
features like SSL termination, logging, metrics, monitoring, rate limiting, and heartbeat services.
It supports different types of services, including gRPC, JSON-RPC, and executable-based services.
The daemon's configuration can be controlled through a file, environment variables, and executable flags.
The payment channel state is stored in an etcddb cluster, either an embedded etcd instance or an externally configured cluster.")

The AGIX Token is an ERC-20 token hosted on the Ethereum Blockchain.
Right now, we are in the beta phase of the SingularityNET Marketplace.
That means that you will need to use Kovan or Ropsten Testnet AGIX to work with our tools.
You can get Kovan or Ropsten Testnet AGIX by following the instructions here.")
