Hi.
Hey there.
You into action movies?
Yeah I like them alright.
What was the last one you saw?
Could you call Guardians of the Galaxy 2 action?
Yeah I think so.
Well it was that one.
What did you think of the movie?
I thought it was pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched any good action films lately?
I seen Mad Max, finally.
Better late than never.What did you think?
I loved the fight scenes.
Charlize Theron does a good fight scene.
She was really something to watch. Her fight scenes were so real.
The whole thing was non stop, like no room to take the film easy.
I thought it could have done with a bit of a slow of pace at times.
Just to catch up after all the fighting?
Yes, and the car chases.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last action movie you saw?
I think the last one I saw was the matrix.
What did you think of it?
It was pretty good. The special effects have mostly aged well.
Yeah they were cutting edge at the time.
Absolutely. They did some interesting and innovative things to get those 360 degree slow motion shots.
Really, what did they do?
Well they had a ton of cameras placed in a circle around the actors and they took frames from the cameras in succession.
Wow that's really interesting. What did you think of Keanu Reeves?
He fit the part well, though his acting was a bit stiff as usual.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That movie Taken was really good.
Yeah,  Liam Neeson is really good.
He's really become quite the action hero in his old age!
He's not that old!
He's 65.
That's getting up there a bit.
Not to take anything away from him. He's super good at doing action.
60 is the new 40!
Ha!
They just shouldn't make any more sequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I thought that The Last Boy Scout was an underrated action flick.
I did too.
Bruce Willis used to be a good actor.
He and Damon Wayans played well off of each other in that movie.
Willis played a private eye down on his luck and Wayans was the Pro Football player.
Yeah, I could go back and watch that one again.
Do you remember who directed that movie?
That was a Tony Scott film.
I didn't realize that he directed that one.
Yeah, he did. He is one of my favorite directors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Blood Father?
No, never heard of it.
Great movie, you have to watch it.
Who is in it?
Mel Gibson.
Wow, haven't seen one of his movies in a while.
That's what I said. He was great in it.
Was he a cop?
No actually a convict, but won't tell you too much.
Okay, I'll check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Stallone movies?
Oh yeah for sure.
What is your favorite?
I like Rambo
All of them or one in particular
The first one is the best. He destroys that small town.
Oh yeah, rebel drifter without a home
Right, shows those local cops who the boss is
A lot of blow ups towards the end
That's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really liked the Leathal Weapon movies.
They were pretty good.
You know why Mel Gibson plays such a great Psycho?
Because he is a psycho?
Ha! Type casting!
He can't be all that crazy.
Why do you say that?
He's got like 3 Oscars.
Crazy good...?
Sure, I'll go for that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Do you like watching movies?
Yeah sure who doesn't.
What about action movies?
Yeah I like those.
Do you have one you like the best?
I love Terminator.
That is a classic.
My all time favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest Wonder Woman movie?
Yes, I saw it over the weekend with my husband. We both loved it. Have you?
Yes, I went last week. I thought it was one of the best super hero movies I have seen in a while.
I agree, great casting with the two leads in particular. I love Chris Pine.
Me too. I wish his character wasn't killed off. But he did a fantastic job.
I know. I think it had some of the best fight scenes I had seen in a while. I love how strong and able the women were.
Me too. It was great to see Robin Wright to so well. She was incredible and the lead was outstanding.
I have never seen her in anything other than the Batman V. Superman movie where she played Wonder Woman.
I saw her in that too. She did not catch my attention as much, but I remember she was good.
She was, but this was by far a more demanding movie. What a fantastic role model for young girls. She is so capable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that they are making a new Predator movie?
Yes, I heard that.
Shane Black is going to direct it.
That's right and he was in the original movie.
The original Predator was a classic.
Yeah, I think that it is one of the most underrated action movies out there.
Predators was also underrated.
Who was in that one?
That one starred Adrian Brody.
Yeah, you wouldn't think of him as an action hero, but he did a great job in that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite James Bond?
Sean Connery, without a doubt!
Mine too, but Roger Moore was pretty good.
I think he did more Bond films than the rest of them put together.
Who's next in line?
Well Craig has been doing it...
He's gotta be about ready to give it up.
I thought I read that he was done after Spectre.
They'll probable offer him a ton of money.
I'll bet!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like taken?
Yes i love taken
I just saw a family guy based off that episode
I bet it was funny
It was really fun
Meg and her friend went to paris and got taken
That sounds great
But i really do love the movies
They were done so well
They are addicting to
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen any action movies from the 70s?
I saw The French Connection.
I think I've heard of it. Who is in that?
Gene Hackman stars and Roy Scheider costars.
Would you recommend it?
Absolutely. The chase scenes are very well done and the acting was top notch.
I've heard about the chase scene that's supposed to be one of the best ever.
Yeah, it is as good as they say in my opinion.
What did you think of Gene Hackman?
He was fantastic, as always.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What action movie has the best bank heist scene?
That has to be Heat.
Of course, that really was a fantastic scene.
Yes, and the rest of the movie was great as well.
What did you think of the diner scene?
That was an amazing scene with two of the best American actors going toe to toe.
Yeah, that was there first scene together in any movie, correct?
Yeah, that is correct.
Who did you like better, De Niro or Pacino?
Pacino was a bit too over the top for me, so I'll choose De Niro.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie?
I really like Gladiator.  Braveheart will probably come second.
Gladiator is one of my favorites too.  It was just a well-done movie from the beginning to end.
I still get teary-eyed when I saw the last scene of Maximus' friend burying Maxmimus' small carvings of his family.
One action movie that I love that doesn't get enough credit is Conan the Barbarian.
Conan the Barbarian?  Is that the movie with NBA Basketball player Wilt Chamberlain?
No, that was the sequel to Conan the Barbarian.  The name was Conan the Destroyer.
Conan the Destroyer was absolutely awful.
James Earl Jones did a great job portraying the villain Thusla Doom in Conan the Barbarian.  He made the movie for me.
The actions scenes in the movie were great too.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was in his prime then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who's your favorite Action movie star?
It's a four way tie. I can't decide between Arnold, Jean Claude Van Damme, Jackie Chan and Bruce Willis.
Okay, first off, I won't even dicuss Arnold. And Van Damme? Please. He's done. Jackie Chan and Bruce Willis, I'll give you.
Okay, who is your favorite action movie Star?
Bruce Lee. Hands down.
Oh good. Let's go with a guy who's been dead for forty years. Bruce Lee is so dead, even his son is dead.
Aren't you a big fan of Abbot and Costello?
Yeah. So?
So, you're a fan of comedians from sixty or seventy years ago but you dismiss my action star from forty years, ago. Hypocrite.
Okay. YOu got me there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the remake of the movie "Point Break"?
I wasn't happy at first, just because I think Hollywood needs to chill out with remaking great old movies, but after watching the remake I thought it was pretty good.
I couldn't agree more. I can't picture Point Break without Keanu Reeves acting at Johnny Utah but the remake followed the orginal storyline pretty well.
The remake had just as much or even more action scenes then the orginial one that was released in 1991.
Can't believe the first one was released in 1991! It's still a classic movie and one of my favorites.
Kathryn Bigelow did a fanstatic job directing the orginial Point Break, as an audience member, the film really throws you into Johnny Utah's extreme life.
Speaking of extreme, how bout that skydiving scene in the first movie? I love that scene.
When Johnny Utah jumps out the airplane with no parachute to catch Bodhi? Yeah man, I doubt that would be possible in real life but it sure looked good on the big screen.
Sometimes I wish I lived a life like Johnny Utah.
I dressed up as one of the dead presidents for halloween a few years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait to see the new Star Wars movie.
What is the title going to be?
The Last Jedi.
I am assuming that Mark Hamill will be reprising his role again.
Yes, he will play Luke again, but from the trailers he seems a bit darker.
How do you mean?
The trailer shows him fearing that the Jedi's time is over with.
Well, everything must end at some point.
I hope that this isn't the last Star Wars film because the franchise is so great.
I hope so too. There are so many memorable characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite movies is Snakes on a Plane.
With Samuel Jackson, right?
Yes.
I saw that a while ago.
He just has so many great lines in that.
He does. But he's good in every movie he's in.
Amazing how an entire movie can take place in a plane.
Yeah, and it kept you interested too.
It sure did. So much going on all the time.
That is high on my list too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Revenant last night.
Cool.  Who was in it?
Leonardo DiCaprio.
Who directed it?
Alejandro G. Iñárritu
Anybody else in it?
Lukas Haas from Witness.
Wow, I remember him.
Yes, he was cool.  The movie was powerful.
I might watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the first Mad Max.
That's an oldie.
Yes, Australian, 1979.
Who directed it?
George Miller.
Mel Gibson looked great in that one.
Who plays his wife?
Joanne Samuel.
I forget, does Max get the killers in the end?
Everyone of them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Patriot's Day this weekend.
I didn't think it showed enough action.
Really? I thought it was just enough.
Yes there wasn't much in the way of chases.
Well, it's based on a true story so they couldn't deviate from that much.
I understand. I was a good movie though other than that.
I thought that it made you really reflect on these people as actual people.
Yes sometimes in movies it's hard to separate fact and fiction.
This was really someones life.
Yes and they did a great job honoring them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If fans had a vote, what do you think they would vote as best action movie?
Probably Die Hard
Is that with Bruce Willis?
Yes
Is it old?
It came out in the 80's
There were tons of good action movies then.
Yeah, there were. Terminator is one of them
You think fans would say Die Hard is better than Terminator?
I think so. But, they are both amazing action movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the explosive scenes of the 90s
why would you miss that
Because it had something about it missing today
What was it missing
It is missing the bombastic set pieces
i think they were cheesy
But cheesy is good
How is it good
It is funny and lively
eh i think it plain sucks
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good action movies?
I seen Wonder Woman, had a lot of action.
That movies was the best! How about some older action movies?
There is one called "Last Action Hero".
With Arnold Schwarzenegger?
Yes. Early 1990's. Action and comedy.
I thought I was the only person who ever saw that show.
It was silly, but the action was amazing!
I liked when the bad guys came out of the screen.
The one guy with the smiley faced eyeball? Scared me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi.
Do you like action movies?
Yeah sure love them.
Do you have an all time favorite.
Point Break has got to be up there.
Oh yeah, great movie.
I haven't seen it in a while.
I saw it recently and it is still great.
Yeah I bet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the Mission Impossible movies did you like the most?
Probably Ghost Protocol.
Isn't that the one where they were dodging sandstorms in the middle east?
Yup, and he was clinging to the building.
That had a really funny line in it, and Simon Pegg is hilarious.
Yours?
Mission Impossible 3.
Really?? Why that one?
That was one of the best-rated, acted, and written. It just didn't get publicity because it's when Tom Cruise came out as crazy.
Oh, right after the couch-jumping scene and Scientology. I'll watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want togo see Wonder Woman soon, but not sure if it is playing this weekend yet.
Wonder Woman came out in the beginning of June, so it should be available to see in theaters still.
Do you know who stars in it, for Wonder Woman?
I think it is Gal Gadot who plays the part, and Chris Pine is also in this one too.
I can't wait to see it, I am a big Wonder Woman fan.
It has gotten some great reviews from the critics.
How much has it made money wise?
The box office has made $485 million dollars so far and counting.
That is a huge success!
Yes, they are doing well with that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Rush Hour?
Who is in that one?
Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker
Oh, that is a very funny movie
Have you seen the second one?
I think so.
Do you like part 1 or 2 better?
I prefer the first one.
Why is that?
I think the bad guy is better. That where he pretends to be a cop and kidnaps the girl is really memorable
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get it to any of Quentit Tarentino's movies?
The guy that made Kill Bill?
Yes, and many others.
No, I think I seen one movie of his.
He has some good stuff.
Like what?
Well, Kill Bill Volume One, I think is his best work.
That has Uma Therman right?
Yes, its sort of an odd film, but lots of drama and action.
I will have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the original actor in "The Mechanic"?
That was Charles Bronson.
Yes, he was a good actor.
His action films were really good when they came out.
Jason Statham took over the reboot.
There are a few more "Mechanic" movies now.
Looks like he has turned it into another franchise.
The first one was really good.
I agree, but the sequels haven't measured up to the first.
Once a character gets developed he needs a place to go in the sequel scripts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Ninja Assassin?
No, what's that?
You'd love it, I'm sure.
Probably, the title is great.
Basically, there's a clan of ninjas.
Let me guess, one's an assassin?
Well, duh. But more specifically, he is kicked out of and then hunted down by his clan.
Oooh, nice. How's the action?
Completely hilariously over-the-top, but overly-edited.
I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think bruce willis is a good actor
he is good in action movies
I think he is pretty meh in every other role
I mean he does play the action role perfectly
I have not seen anyone perform it as good
I know right
I honestly wish he would do more movies
It would be pretty cool
Maybe he can do with a good role
It would be nice
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey
Are you on your way
Yea i am hurrying up
Well stop taking your time
I am not
We gotta watch this new action movie set in china tonight
I know it is the hot thing
The story is supposed to be so good
Well we will watch it soon as i get there
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action movies
I love them
I really like the in time movie
Is that the one with justin timberlake?
Yes
That one was good
And really interesting
It gave a whole new perspective on life
Yes i cant imagine living like that
Me either
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Die Hard movie is your favorite?
Definitely the first one.
Me too.
I love some of John McClains lines.
Yea he had a lot of memorable ones.
I liked that one cop too.
The one that first showed up.
Yes. He's been in a few movies but I don't know his name.
I couldn't stand the main bad guy. Don't remember his name.
I didn't like any of the bad guys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Accountant?
Wasn't that the movie that came out with Ben Affleck?
Yep.  I saw it on a plane the other day.
What's the verdict?
Pretty forgettable.  He's not a very likeable hero and the action scenes were bland.
It kind of bombed at the box office if I remember correctly.
Ben Affleck is just not an action star.
I think he's a better director than actor personally.
Agreed.  He needs to stay out of the camera lens as his true talent lies elsewhere.
Hopefully his next movie will be better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Speed?
The movie from the 90's?
That's the one.  Keanu Reeves was in it.
Also had Sandra Bullock I think.  Launched her to stardom.
That movie had tons of great set pieces.  It was original too.
Dennis Hopper was awesome in that movie.  He played a truly good bad guy.
It's too bad they ruined it with Speed 2.
Never saw it.  Weren't they on a cruise ship?
Yep.
Yeah, I'll never watch that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you consider an iconic action movie or series?
I have really enjoyed the Die Hard series. They weren't all stellar, but when they hit, they were really enjoyable.
The first one was such a classic. I didn't watch Bruce Willlis much on that TV show he did, but I really thought he made a great transition to films with Die Hard.
I loved how the filmmakers weren't afraid to blow a ton of shit up, and they ended up basically destroying the entire bulding by the end.
I've watched the film many times, and it's amazing how beat up John gets over the course of the film, but he keeps on fighting, and he's really believable.
I agree with you there. John was a really credible, realistic hero, and you could feel his pain and frustration and determination to get the bad guy.
And what a great bad guy! I love that he was urbane and witty and cultured and in the end, all he wanted was a shitload of money.
That movie really stands the test of time, too. The fight sequences were epic.
Guns, fights, lots of action, the hero reuniting with his estranged wife, the cop sidekick, the wisecracking FBI guys. A great movie all around.
I think Bruce Willis really eanred his rep as an action hero in this and subsequent movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Jack Reacher.
Did you like it?
Yes, I'm a Tom Cruise fan.
Who directed it?
Christopher McQuarrie.
Anybody else in it?
The great Werner Herzog.
Nice,  Was it based on a book?
The Lee Child series.
He's pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the James Bond movies?
I could take them or leave them.
Me too. There are so many.
I only saw a few.
The only one I remember was Die Another Day.
What year was that one out?
I think it was 2002.
I saw a few but don't even remember their names. Was there one called Casino Royale?
Yes, that was out in 2006.
I saw parts of that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen undisputed 2?
Yea, with michael jai white!
Yea, that guy is a beast.
Yea, he is so good at martial arts.
There were a lot of good fight scenes in that movie.
The best one was at the end with boyka.
Who is Boyka Played my?
Scott Adkins I think.
That guy is amazing, too.
Yea, the two of them together was an unstoppable combination.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever watch John Carpenter movies?
Sometimes.
Ghosts of Mars is one that you should watch. It is an action movie with a slight horror twist to it.
Sounds good. Who was in that one?
That had Jason Statham in it.
I like him.
Was it a fairly recent movie?
Yes, it came out in 2001.
Who else was in it?
Of all people Ice Cube was in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Steven Seagal movie?
On Deadly Ground, and you?
I like Under Siege and Under Siege 2.
Yeah, Under SIege is pretty good, but I've never seen Under Siege 2. What's it like?
Well, Casey Ryback(Steven Seagal) is on a train with his niece, when it is hijacked by terrorists looking to use a top secret particle beam satellite to destory Washington
Okay, I little sci-fi, but doesn't sound to bad. Plenty of action I take it?
Yep, Steven does everything from martial arts to improvised explosives to using a truck to get back on the train after being forced off.
Okay, plenty of action then. Do you have a favorite fight?
Yes, Steven fights one of the top bad guys in a one on one knife fight, takes the knife away, beats the stuffing out of him, then kills him in the kitchen of the dining car.
Okay, I'll be giving this one a look in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any good action movies you can suggest for us?
Do you mean old or new?
Either. We are getting sick of comedies.
How about Assault on Precinct 13.
Is that the one with Ethan Hawke?
Yes. Did you ever see it?
No actually we never watched that one.
Well, it's a good one.
That's a remake isn't it?
I believe it is. Very good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ready for the final Planet of the Apes film?
God, yes. Andy Serkis is amazing.
Yeah, and the direction and action have been great.
There's one thing I"m not sure about.
What's that?
Woody Harrelson, with a shaved head, as a military commander.
Yeah, that was a bit odd, but he can make it work.
Do you think they'll pull a twist and have the humans win?
That would be pretty interesting as a swerve, but the human population is dying off.
Yeah, they wouldn't support themselves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you imagine a world where denzel washington did not do action
That would be a crazy world
Yeah it would
It would be a world that was nowhere near as good
I know he is funny but He is the bomb in action
I know it would not be the same
I love him in Django unchained
He is amazing in  that
One of his best
Easily the best
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Gone In 60 Seconds?
No, who played in that?
It was a Nicholas Cage film.
He has really gone downhill as an actor.
Yes, but this was one of his earlier works.
Was this a reboot?
Yes, the original film came out back in the 70's.
Sometimes those turn out good and sometimes not.
Well this one is worth a watch.
I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Departed?
Yes, that movie is insane.
That's probably one of the best action movies I have ever seen.
Yeah, the plot is awesome and so is the action.
I think I liked it so much because it seemed so real.
I agree. I feel like that sort of thing actually goes on in real life.
The cast was so good, too.
Yeah there were quite a few A-list celebrities in that one.
The characters all had their own agenda and they were ruthless.
Yes, they were. By the end of the movie my jaw was on the floor in awe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like the marvel movies?
Those are great action movies! Can't wait for the new Thor one.
Black Panther is going to be great too, I hope that one does really well.
I hope it does as least as great as Wonderwoman, you know. Really break some records out there.
Wonderwoman was amazing! It really was directed well with plenty of great action near the end.
Reminds me of the feeling of Guardians of the Galaxy, really. That sense of loss then pulling out the win at the end.
Both did have that punch moment, true. It has the whole drawing you in and making you really feel.
Speaking of action movies, Pacific Rim was another great one.
I didn't like that one as much, but the concept was truly unique.
Come on, giant robots? What's not to like?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you rate Dark Knight as the best action movie of all time?
No because it was an action movie but it wasnt at the same time.
In what respect?
You didnt NEED blowing up and fighting for that movie to be good.
So it was more of a thriller?
It did a good job of combinging the two.
That makes it all the more fun.
Ledger acted the heck out of his role.
Bale was a great complementary piece in that one.
Its a shame they couldnt do another one since we dont know if The Joker died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see doctor strange yet?
I finally got around to watching it
weren't the space time bending effects insane?
yeah , that part where doctor strange has the cloak "come to him" was crazy
he got totally lucky in that scene as the bad guys had him outnumbered
what did you think of that time-loop sequence at the end
that was unreal. that was pretty creative way for strange to get the upper hand
I know , right. that was amazing!
I really hope they make a sequel soon
I have no doubt that they will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Alien movie franchise?
I love the Alien movies. Ridley Scott is a genius.
I agree with that, and Sigourney Weaver is great as Ripley.
Those to me are some of the scariest movies of all time.
No arguments there. I had no idea Prometheus was a prequel for the Alien movies.
It was? I've never even seen Prometheus.
Oh you've gotta see it, it's a great movie. Let's you know what happened before the original Alien.
Wow I've got to make it a point to see that one. Have you seen Alien Covenant?
The brand new one? Not yet but I heard it wasn't that great.
I don't like taking others' opinions for movies but I think I'll give it a try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?
You know I do. I love an action packed Pirate movie!
Me too. I wonder how it will hold up to the other ones.
I think they've done really well so far. Each Pirates of the Caribbean movie seems better than the last.
I don't know, I'm still a fan of the first one. I doubt anything will top that.
That's true, I feel like that was the first time Johnny Depp realized that deep down he is a pirate.
A Captain at that! He has started to look more piratey over the years.
He really has. He plays the role so well, its easy to get immersed in the movie.
I agree. I don't think anyone could do a better job than him.
Who knows, maybe one day we'll be reading about Johnny Depp, commandeering a boat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Edge of Tomorrow?
What is that?
It's Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt dying every day to learn how to defeat aliens who can reset time.
That's what it's called?
Yeah.
I saw it but not that name.
What was it?
Live. Die. Repeat.
Oooh, they renamed it because the studio thought we couldn't handle the title.
Seriously? It's not that hard to figure out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Blue Streak?
Nope. What is that about?
It is a buddy cop movie.
Who is in that movie?
Luke Wilson and Martin Lawrence. They are hilarious.
What do they do in that movie?
They try to find a diamond that Martin Lawrence actually was stealing.
Wow. That sounds so good.
It is a great movie. It's a classic and is much better than Bad Boys in my opinion.
Bad Boys was pretty underwhelming. I will check out Blue Streak.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Eastwood action films?
Like Dirty Harry?
Yes, the old school nothing but action and a bit of romance here and there.
I think he is the perfect example  of action star.
His best one may be Gran Torino.
I loved how that one followed his life, like he was still old but a really bad and cool guy.
It reminded me of his part in Sudden Impact.
The raw tuff guy you mean?
Yes, that whole action man persona he does.
His work in the Enforcer, that was action to its core.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Christmas movie of all times is "Die Hard."
"Die Hard" isn't a Christmas movie, it's an action-adventure movie.
It takes place at Christmas. That makes it a Christmas movie.
Fine. Name me one other Christmas movie with guns and explosions in it. If you can do that, I'll admit "Die Hard" is a Christmas movie.
That's too easy. "Home Alone." I bet you think of that as a Christmas movie, don't you?
"Home Alone" is a movie aimed at the entire family. Yes, It's got some action-adventure in it but it's for the entire family.
And I think "Die Hard" is a great movie for the entire family. I think you have a bias against Action-Adventure movies. Don't you want your children to be able to recognize a European scum terrorist/thief?
Honestly, no, that isn't one of my biggest concerns. I love action-adventure movies. I love "Die Hard." But "Die Hard" is Not a Christmas movie.
It Takes place at Christmas. That makes it a Christmas movie.
You're weird!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a good action movie to watch?
I just saw London Has Fallen. I thought it was really good.
I saw Olympus Has Fallen and I liked that a lot. Is London Has Fallen similar?
I actually thought it was better than the first one.
Is Gerard Butler back in it?
He is and he's tough as nails.
Why did you think it was better than the first?
I just thought the premise of London Has Fallen was a bit more believable.
Yeah, some parts of Olympus Has Fallen seemed a bit far fetched.
Exactly. This one seemed much more plausible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh, man. That new Mummy...
There's a new Mummy too? Man, I haven't seen Brendan Fraser for a while.
No, man. He's not in it. It's... different.
He's not? So they rebooted another reboot? Like Spider-Man?
Yeah, I don't know why they do this. This is really bad.
Is it the same story? Same characters and everything?
No. I don't... know if it's the same as those old ones, but it's not like the Brendan Fraser ones.
What is it like, then?
Well, it's got Tom Cruise as a soldier in modern-day Iraq. And... uh, it's got Jekyll and Hyde.
What.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see John Wick?
Chapter Two?
Of course.
No. Probably not.
Why?
I didn't really care for the first one.
I thought it was great.
He freaked out because they killed his dog.
Have you ever owned a dog?
Well, yeah, but I don't think I'd go ballistic like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We just watched John Wick 2 the other night.
Really, is it on HBO?
No we rented the DVD. It was great.
I loved the first one.
Well the second one is just as good.
Same people in it?
Well of course John Wick, and the man in charge of The Continental.
I like that actor, what's his name?
I think Ian McShane.
Thats him, he's a great actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Jason Bourne movies have they made?
Four I think.
The whole franchise has kind of run together at this point.
I'd agree.  Seems like they are out of ideas as he can only run from the government so much.
And Matt Damon ain't getting younger.  He must be at least 40 now.
The age doesn't bother me, but I just don't think there's much more of a story to tell.
The last movie was a bit of a drag.
Yeah, felt like a 'been there, done that' type of thing.
At least you get to see a lot of worldly locations in the films.
Very true - haven't seen them in Utah yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any Bruce Lee movies?
Of course, I'm a huge fan. I love all of them!
What's your favorite Bruce Lee movie?
Oh that's definitely Enter the Dragon.
For me it's Fists of Fury. That black and yellow suit is the same one Uma Thurman wore in Kill Bill.
I know, that was a great homage. It's crazy that his son was killed almost the same way he was.
I know, that was very tragic too. He was a great fighter and great person all around.
I love martial arts movies but he's my favorite star. Have you seen the movies about his master?
You mean Ip Man? Yes those movies were great too, great storyline and background.
My father turned me on to Martial Arts movies when I was young and I haven't stopped watching since.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Logan movie yet?
You mean the Xmen movie?
Well, it's not really much super hero stuff.
How if Wolverine is in it?
It's about him trying to just get by.He's a drunk.
My favorite character wasting his life.
Well, not really. It really kicks in when he tries to help someone.
Who, another Xmen?
Not really, but you have to watch it yourself. Lots of action.
Well of course with Hugh Jackman in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the Expendables, have you seen it?
Yes, I saw it a while ago. What did you think?
It was really cool seeing all of my favorite action stars on screen together.
Who was your favorite character?
I was looking forward to seeing Jason Statham. He didn't disappoint.
Yeah, he was good but Sylvester Stallone will always be my favorite.
I was a little disappointed that  Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't have a bigger role.
I agree, I expected more than a cameo.
Maybe he'll have a bigger part in one of the sequels.
That would be the best. I hope that happens!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched  Inglourious Basterds the other day. What a great movie!
I haven't seen it. what is it about?
It is set in WWII and its about a plan to assassinate Nazi leaders.
Wow, sounds good. Who is in it?
Brad Pitt has the lead role.
I think Brad Pitt is such a great action hero. He was great in World War Z.
I liked World War Z a lot too.
Have you ever seen Snatch?
I have, that is one of my favorite movies of all time.
Me too. I could watch Snatch over and over and not get tired of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Tony, let's go to a movie tonight!
Ok. What are you up for?
An action movie!
I do't know. There are so few good ones made anymore.
What are you talking about? There are tons of good action movies!
There are tons of action movies, but few have really god character development or interesting plot.
What abut the Transformers? That was a good series!
The first one was pretty good, but then Hollywood decided to make all those sequels...
What's wrong with sequels?
They are like new wives: A figment of self-delusion. You fool yourself to think that the next one will be better than the one you were able to get while you were in your prime!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you give me a good Van Damme  movie to watch tonight?
Sure, how about Timecop?
That sounds good. Is it full of action?
Yes it is.
How bout another great action movie?
How about They Live?
Who directed that one?
John Carpenter
I thought he was a horror guy
He is, for the most part, but They Live is a great action film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which actor do you think wreck most of the famous sports car he drives?
ha, it's gonna be Daniel Craig, the famous 007
yes indeed, he always get  laid with gorgeous women as well
except the relationship never worked in the end, just like the way he is with his cars
haha, that's spot on
so which bonds movie do you like the best?
I think I love royal casino the most, we have Eva Green and Austin Martin in it, and of course casino
If I remember right, it has a sad ending
yeah, the girl got a deal with some bad dudes, and she has to give away all the money bonds earned at the casino
I guess she died in the end
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what they need to remake?  Lethal Weapon.
You mean the one from the 80's?
Yeah.  Danny Glover, Mel Gibson, pure classic.
It was kind of one of the original buddy cop movies.
But one of the better ones recently done.
Mel Gibson was crazy in that movie.
It was interesting how they made his character a loose cannon yet but somehow employed.
What do you mean?
You would think any other cop would have been fired long ago.
Well, that is why it's a movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen suicide squad?
Nope have not had a chance to see it yet
I would avoid it if i were you
Why
Just trust me on that
Well tell me why
Because it is really bad the plot is shameful
Nothing like the comics?
Not at all such a letdown
Well now i am just saddened
XXXXXXXXXXX
What action movies do you recommend me to see this summer?
Personally I'd recommend Wonder Woman.
I'm a bit skeptical when it comes to that movie. I really feel it's over hyped because it's a chick.
Honestly the movie is good, I won't lie to you it does a bit of the whole "girl power" crap but not so much where you get turned off.
So what is the movie about? Origin story or something else?
Yup it's basically just like the comics. Set in world war 2, meets that stranded pilot,etc. You know how the story goes.
So she helps end world war 2?
Yeah, well she basically ends it herself, but the guys help too.
Seriously? If it's overdone just let me know now so I don't waste my time.
No it's very enjoyable. You won't even think about all the girl power junk in it if you are a fan of the comic and character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you seen the new guardians of the galaxy?
DUDE YES Chris Pratt was the bomb!
I loved baby groot
Eh he's over rated
Dude he's freakin adorable
You sound gay bruh
Nah he's just a cute little fella
Well I like that buff grey dude
Bruh you gay
Hey! Forget you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Do you like the action movie genre?
I like it alright I guess.
What was the last action movie that you saw?
I saw the avengers civil war.
Did you like it?
Yeah I thought it was decent.
I haven't seen it yet.
It's pretty solid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Aliens as scary as Alien?
Actually Aliens is more of an action film?
It's not horror?
It is scary, but there is a lot of shooting and fighting in it.
So, it's not as suspense driven?
No, part 1 is more horror/suspense and part 2 is more action.
Do you like it?
It's a pretty good movie
Who directed it?
James Cameron. Ridley Scott directed part 1.
XXXXXXXXXXX
John Wick 2 is a beautifully shot film.
You're not kidding. Tons of wide shots.
Right. Yeah. Great choreography.
And the editing.
The editing is particularly impressive in that there are actually a lot of long takes.
None of that crappy two second shot lengths like in a lot of action films.
Sure,  Quantum of Solace feels so long be cause it has about a  million edits in it.
It's the shortest James Bond film, but it feels like the longest.
And that's why John Wick 2 feels so great. The action is very fluid and not chopped up.
It means you can appreciate things like the pencil scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always thought Terminator was one of the best action movies ever.
Oh, yeah.  It's right up there.
Linda Hamilton is amazing in the sequel, though.
She made a big impression on me growing up.
I wonder how long she has to work out to look so buff.
I'm sure she had to train relentlessly for months.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is so awesome always.
Yeah, I'd watch any action film with him in it.
Hey, have you ever seen Commando?  That's an underrated film of his.
I saw it long ago.  Yeah, I remember thinking it was pretty entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The A-Team movie was on yesterday.
Really, I love that movie. It was a great extension from a not so great tv show.
Liam Neeson did a great job as Hannibal.
He is a top notch actor.
The fight scenes were intense although some of the action was over the top.
I agree. The CGI graphics were a bit much some times.
The actor who played Mr. T's role looked just like the original.
He really did look like him.
This was definitely an underrated film that didn't get much attention.
It sure didn't get any critical acclaim.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My all time favorite flick has got to be Die Hard.
Such a classic.
Bruec Willis in his prime...
I know! He was the man back then.
He just does too much now.
Yeah, he really needs to pick his projects a little more carefully.
I keep see new movies of his on Netflix that I've never even heard of.
I think some of his stuff is missing the theaters.
And rightfully so!
He has been doing some qestionable stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what are some of your favorite action movies?
Well, I for sure have to mention the films of John Woo.  there's so many, it's hard to pick just one.
Oh, yeah, he's awesome!
Yeah, I liked The Killer, Hard Boiled, Face/Off, Hard Target, there's just so many cool scenes in each of them.
I've always like the whole "guy with two guns" thing he does in each film
Yeah, that's awesome.  Oh, and Mission Impossible 2 was good, although I'm told Cruise interfered a lot with the final cut of the film.
I liked that movie, although I did think that ending part was a little bit cheesy.  You know they way Ethan Hunt kicks the sand and the gun flys STRAIGHT up into his hand, like it was just levitating or something.
Yeah, I admit, that part was a little over the top, but still, that's what you go to action movies for, right?
Yeah, true.  Oh, interesting not, do you know the hospital in The Killer is called the Scared Heart? I think it was supposed to be Sacred Heart, but someone must have goofed on that.
Oh, man, I never noticed that!  I gotta re-watch that film now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Running Man?
Yes, that is with Arnold Shwarzenegger right?
Yes, he is in that one.
He is in tons of action movies.
Ever seen Total Recall?
Of course. He is good in that one too.
I liked him in Conan the Barbarian a lot.
Oh yeah and Conan the Destroyer.
Did you like him in Terminator 3?
Yes, but I liked him way better in part 1 and 2.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of movies do you like?
I like action
Me too, do you have a favorite
I really liked John wick
I havent seen it, is it good?
Its really good you should watch it
I will
Im excited to see the second one
I bet you will like that one too
Im hoping to see it this weekend
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you consider the avengers an action movie?
What else could you call it?
Some may say a thriller!
I dont think thats accurate.
I think Captain America played the best role.
Well Iron Man usually steals the scenes.
He has the best line thats why
How would you rate it in terms of other action movies?
Well it was mainly more focused around the plot rather than special effects.
So I guess the fighting was not that great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite scene in an action movie?
The opening scene in "Saving Private Ryan" has to be my favorite.
I loved that scene. Tom Hanks and all the other actors did a great job at portraying what the Army really went through when they landed on Normandy that fateful day.
It was extremly realistic. I heard Steven Speilberg  hired something like 3000 real soliders to act as extras just in that one scene.
Oh wow, I've never heard that before, do you know where the scene was actually filmed?
They were fimed on Ballinesker Beach, which is in Ireland.
That's awesome. You can't get much better then the actors in that movie.
Vin Diseal, Matt Damon, Tom Hanks, etc. The list goes on and on.
How many Academy Awards did the film win?
It was nominated for 11 but won 5 in total!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen salt?
No but i always wanted to
I saw it, it was pretty good
Im a big fan of angelina jo lie
Then you need to watch this movie you will love it
I really need to
Its really good
Ill have to find it and watch it
You wont be disappointed
Great
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to go see Kong: Skull Island?
No, I have not. What was it like?
It was quite stunning, the director Jordan Vogt-Roberts did a great job with the action in this movie.
Who starred in the production?
Tom Hiddelston, Brie Larson, Samuel L Jackson and John Goodman were all in this one!
Nice cast, I suspect Tim was the leading man?
Yes, they end up finding an unchartered island together with quite a bit of danger and of course Kong.
It looks better than the last Kong movie they did in Hollywood.
You should go see it, maybe next week if I can I will go with you.
Thanks! That sounds great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Hung Fu Hustle?
Yes, thats such a great movie.
Yeah, I love the fight scenes in that movie, they are so original.
Who directed it?
Stephen Chow, he also plays Sing in the movie.
I didn't know that.  Did he also direct Kung Fu Hustle 2?
I don't remember.  They only released it on You Tube?
Thats the modern day version of releasing a movie straight to VHS.
Ha, I guess it is cause i never saw it.
Yeah, its better that way, the orginal was the best anyway.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hello.
Do you have a favorite action movie?
Let me think.
Sure think about it for a bit.
I would say Die Hard.
Which one?
The second one.
That's a pretty good call.
yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Taken?
With Liam Neeson?
Yes.
I have seen the first one, is there not like eight of them?
I think there are three. What did you think.
Well, I think he is a bad parent.
How so?
He keeps letting his kid get abducted.
But, that is the whole plot.
Well, the same thing over and over. Kid gets taken, he kills bad guys, gets the kid, ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Arnold Schwarznegger is one of my favorite actors.
What movies did you like him in?
Terminator is a classic movie.
Oh, that was one of the best movies.
It's so cool how he was a robot terminating people.
There were plenty of action scenes.
Yeah, I don't like the soft romantic stuff.
It's a pretty fast paced movie.
That's good. I don't like to be bored watching movies.
Arnold movies are always fun to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a big fan of The Matrix
I liked the first one, but the other ones were pretty bad
Yeah, the first one was really new and fresh
Had a lot of cool special effects
Not sure if I ever followed the actual story line
Right, when you strip out all the action and effects, the story line is pretty lame
Something about red and blue pills
Well there's that and how the world isn't what it seems
Yeah, pretty weird
Too sci fi for my taste
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching this movie
I am sitting right next to you
Well man you see that scene
What one
The one where the dude flew through the window
Yeah it was cool
It was intense this movie is walls banging
It is pretty cool
The action is non stop
Well then we can watch another afterwards
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the new Transformers movie will be good?
I dont think so because the cast is terrible
It wasnt that good when Shia was still doing them
Yeah the acting fell of on Dark Side of the Moon
It wasnt that bad of a movie
But the special effects are great.
Sometimes I get lost in fight scenes with that franchise.
I know what you mean you cant tell what transformer is what
Yes and sometimes the voices I forget
All in all though the franchise isnt THAT bad just has taken a turn for the worse
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want you to tell me quickly what is the best action movie of all time?
Has to be "Crank" hands down
No way "John Wick"  is the best action movie ever made, just look at how many people he kills
True, but in "Crank"  Jason Statham is killing people with his heart all messed up
Okay i'll give you that, but I would at least rank Taken a little bit higher than Crank I think Liam does a great job
Yes Liam Neeson is great in pretty much any movie he doe's and I will give you that Taken is an awesome movie
And don't forget since you obviously like Jason Statham that he also did the Transporter series
Yes those are also some killer action movies, especially when he kicks the door in.
Yeah or the fight scene in the garage where he is slipping through the oil
Oh man I forgot all about that scene
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Face Off?
One of my favorites!
I know! It was so good!
I think what was most compelling is Cage and Travolta trading off.
Yeah, they both get to play the good and bad guy.
Very cool.
And the action was super intense.
I didn't care much for the "procedure".
Yeah, that was a bit gross.
I'm shuddering just thinking about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Do you enjoy action movies?
Yeah definitely.
Got a favorite?
I would probably say The Fifth Element.
Oh man I do love that movie.
It's so great it has everything.
And Chris Tucker's character is amazing.
Ruby Rod is fantastic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the Die Hard movies is your favorite?
I'm going to go ahead and actually pick a somewhat recent one.
Please, not the one in Russia.
Oh, of course not. That was ridiculous.
Yeah, A Good Day to Die Hard was insanely awful.
Live Free or Die Hard, with Justin Long
That was pretty good, yeah.
Which was the one with the racist sign that he had to wear?
I think that was Die Hard 2. Timely with the riots.
That was kind of stupid and disturbing but we got to meet Samuel L Jackson!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action movies?
I loved Mad Max Fury Road?
Me too. Whose your favorite character?
Furiosa
Yeah, I can see that. Seems like it was more about Furiosa and Immortan Joe than about Max
I just like her character as she was really strong
I liked her mechanical arm
And her shaved head
Do you think they will make another movie?
I hope so. I love the post nuclear holocaust theme.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a movie called headshot.
was it good?
yeah, it was the story of this really evil dude that kidnaps kids and turns them into henchmen.
that's bad. so the kids are doing bad stuff?
they're adults when we see them. they call the bad guy father but he's really twisted
twisted how?
he tosses the kids in a well and makes them kill each other for water or food. the survivors form his gang.
that is twisted.yes. One guy named Aldi or some like that tries to leave the gang I guess, subtitles.
foriegn film?
yeah, I think it may have been made in Jakarta or it was a place in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie?
My favorite action movie is probably Dirty Harry.
That's an interesting choice.
How so?
Well it's not very politically correct in these times because of all the police incidents.
I could see that point of view, but Dirty Harry never killed or hurt anyone that didn't have it coming.
That's true, he never killed an innocent person.
Yeah, Harry was just out to stop someone he knew for sure was a serial killer.
I could see how one might break the rules in that situation.
Yeah, it's somewhat easy to sympathize with Dirty Harry in that film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, do you think Scarface is an action movie? Or is it crime?
It's definitely an action movie, at least in the Al Pacino version. That's the only one I've seen.
Me too. But isn't crime a different category?
There's different kinds of crime movies. Like Godfather III is actually sort of an opera, and sort of a love story too.
Really? I never saw it. Is it good?
Yeah, kind of. But Scarface is an action movie because of all the violent action. You have to have violence in an action movie, I think.
Or you could call it a romance, because of Michelle Pfeiffer. What a massively unhappy marriage.
Yeah, she was great as Elvira--and there was another woman too, Mary Elizabeth Matroantonio. But it was Pacino's film.
Yeah. His work made the whole corrupt rags-to-riches story seem almost heroic.
Yeah, almost. You still knew he was just a drug dealer, who would die in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you have a favorite action film?
maybe enter the dragon with bruce lee.
that was good but i liked the one where he fought chuck norris.
that is epic. i forgot about that one.
two of the best fighters ever going against each other.
yeah, and bruce knocked him out.
I guess bruce really is the better fighter.
i wish i could see a real fight between them
especially because there are so many sayings about chuck
bruce is better though
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite action movie?
I would have to say The Rock
What did you like about that one?
I thought it was a good mix of action and suspense.
Who was your favorite character?
Definitely Sean Connery's character
And why is that?
He had alot of depth to unravel and he played it so well.
Did you hear about the theory that he was actually his 007 character?
Yes, and frankly, I want to believe that so badly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't the new Transformers movie coming out soon?
This Friday I think.
What's even going on with these things anymore?
I can't keep track myself.  This is the fifth movie or something by now I think.
You can only film the destruction of the world so much.
To me, the movies are just too loud and dumb.
Yeah.  It was cute at first, but got old quick.
But they'll keep making them until people stop going.
Fat chance of that.  Too many fanboys.
I'll probably watch them all someday when I'm bored.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that war movie Fury.
Yes it was great.
I loved the beginning when the nazi was riding along and got knocked right off his horse and knived in the head.
Oh yes that was great, but how about the panzer fight.
Yes the Panzer fight was cool, but that german machine gun just chopping off soldiers leg was wicked.
Yes that was graphic for my taste.
Then those poor nazi in the building they shot white phosphorous in was cooking.
Yes I think the gunner took pity on them when he shot them.
I hated to see them all, die.
At least the kid lived on to tell thier brave story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Professional last night.
That was one cool movie.  Who was the young girl?
The great Natalie Portman.
Wow.  Who directed?
Luc Besson, who went on to do Taken and Lucy.
Both nice action flicks.  Who is the Professional?
Jean Reno.
He looks like a mean dude.
Gary Oldman was the bad cop.
He got his just desserts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Last Samurai?
Nope. Is it a Japanese movie?
It is actually American and is about an American samurai.
No way! How did they pull that off?
They actually did a good job.
Who is in this movie?
Tom Cruise plays the American Samurai.
What are some of the lessons of this film?
This movie shows you how to be honorable.
Interesting. Sounds like a strange concept but it's worth checking out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite mafia action movie?
Wow that's a good question. I would have to say Donnie Brasco.
I love that movie! There's some intense parts in it.
Yeah like how they chop the guys up in the basement.
Did you know that it is based on a true story?
Wow, that's pretty messed up.
Yeah, it is hard to believe how ruthless the mafia was.
It is probably the reason why the mafia fell apart.
I agree, they associated with too many killers, even though they were mainly about business.
It's a good thing that kind of stuff is illegal or they would control everything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey, yesterday's movie was awesome huh?
yea, real steel was really awesome!
charlie was really stuck up though.
yea, he was so keen on the money.
max really cared about the robot.
yea he did, he claimed it was his
true. but the dad only wanted to use him to get good money.
he got better later on though.
yes he did and im glad he did.
i guess fighting brings familily together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder who would win
Between who
A fight with bruce lee and Bruce willis
Is that not obvious
No it is not
I think it is pretty obvious
Well tell me
Lee would win hands down
I do not know Willis is pretty tough
But he is nothing compared to lee
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hello
What is up
Nothing much
Same just watching some old flicks
Oh yea?
Yeah enjoying some good old die hard
I love the second movie
The best christmas movie of all time
For sure fam
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Pirates movie yet?
Not yet.  I heard it was just okay.
That's pretty accurate.  The plot was better than some other movies.
That's what I hate about some of these movies. They can be an incoherent mess.
This one is much simpler.
How was Johnny Depp in this one?
It was kind of weird.  He wasn't a focus as much as I thought he would be.
He is getting old, 50-something by now.
I'm not so sure they'll be another movie in the franchise.  They've milked this thing.
If there's cash to be made, expect another one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie kingsmen?
Yes it was a great movie
I love spy movies
Me too
And this one had lots of action and suspense
I just found out they are coming out with a new one this year
Thats awesome, when?
I read in september
I cant wait
Me either
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the hunger games
Yes they were good.
Im glad we dont have anything like that
Me too
I cant imagine kids killing each other
Me either, thats just horrible
I know
But it still has a good story and plot
Yes i agree
Thanks for talking to me
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Goodfellas?
Is that the one with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci?
Yes, The story about the 3 mafia guys.
I love that movie, its really intense.
It definitely is, its one of my favorite mafia movies.
Do you remember the part in the bar?
You mean when Tommy shoots Spider? Or the part with Billy Bats?
The part with Spider, that was brutal.
He basically shot the guy for no reason.
He was such a hot head he couldn't control his anger.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You remember that True Lies movie?
From way back when.  1994 I think.
Yeah.  That was a pretty solid movie though.
I remember Jamie Lee Curtis was in it as his wife.
Which seems weird as she doesn't seem like a sex symbol.
She actually looked pretty good in it where she had to wear that dress.Which
I appreciated that the movie had a bit of campiness.
Especially at the end.  The main bad guy died by getting stuck on a missile.
That's what I'm saying.  It poked fun at itself.
Better thrillers usually do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what was an underrated movie?  The Fugitive.
Wow, what year did that come out?
1993 I think.
I remember seeing it in theater way back when.
Harrison Ford did a great job in that movie as the doctor.
But Tommy Lee Jones stole the show.  That dude is all business.
I liked how the plot continually advanced.  They didn't waste time on a dumb backstory.
That was crazy when he jumped off the dam.
Nobody could survive that.  That was the only part I didn't like.
Didn't bother me.  Made for a great visual.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Kick-Ass sequel?
No. Hated the first one.
Yeah, it was a little odd.
So why'd you watch the second?
Jim Carrey.
Was he any good?
Kinda weird....
Figures.
So, I take it you won't be watching it?
Not on you life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Matrix?
Yes I have seen all of them and I loved them.
I really liked the first two, but the last one didn't make sense to me.
Yeah it was kind of weird how they ended the series.
I really loved how they displayed the virus of the program as 'agents'.
I like how in the second movie they show the agents all forming into one more powerful agent.
I think the first matrix is probably Keanu Reeves best movie ever.
I totally agree with you. He is a really cool actor for that role.
Its amazing how much time and effort they put into making the first matrix movie.
Yeah, it ended up with some really good fight scenes and bullet dodging.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Great Wall?
No, it looked pretty cheesy to me.
It was ok.  Some of the action scenes were cool.
I couldn't believe Matt Damon was in it.  I like his movies ususally.
Did you see all of the Bourne movies?
Yeah, those are some of my favorite action movies.
I really didn't like the Bourne Legacy though.
No, me either.  Bourne has got to be Matt Damon for sure.
Jeremy Renner isn't bad really though.  I liked him in The Hurt Locker.
I think he did good playing Hawkeye in the Avengers movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Rambo III?
yes, that's where Rambo helps defeat the Russians, right?
Right, he helps the Afghans combat the Russians.
Kind of unsettling to realize they would eventually attack the U.S.
Yes, this was still when the Cold War was up and running
Stallone was pretty ripped back then.
Oh for sure. It was peak Stallone muscle days.
Do you think he used drugs?
PEDs for sure. No way that was natural
yeah, probably not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Fast & Furious?
Yes I love that movie.
Me too. The soundtrack makes it even better.
Agreed. See You Again is one of my favorite songs.
Have you seen any other action movies lately?
I loved Catch Me If You Can.
I remember that movie had a great cast.
Who was in it again?
It had Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprico.
Oh yeah! They are both so talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie?
Dark Knight, without a doubt!
That was a pretty good flick.
Heath Ledger played the best Joker ever!
Yeah, but Batman was a little lacking.
It's that stupid voice he puts on.
He does a great Wayne though.
True. He plays a playboy to the hilt.
And alfred is just wonderful.
You can't really top Micheal Caine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you ever seen Never Back Down?
Yea, I thought it was really good!
Really? I thought it was kind of cheesy.
Well, yea, but movies like that are supposed to be.
That's true, like how this football player who's never had a fight in his life is suddenly going up against top fighters.
Yea, that was pretty stupid.
Or how about how that guy's girlfriend just dumps him and gets with the new guy so fast?
Yea, the script wasn't well thought out.
The fight scenes were great though.
Oh yea, the fight scenes were fantastic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action movies?
Yes i love them
They are so much fun to watch
One of my favorites is the jason bourne movies
Those are great.
Yes, theres so much action
Matt damon is the perfect actor too
Yes hes great for the part
He really brings the movies together
He does
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good action movies lately?
Of course, that is my favorite genre of movies!
I am really excited about some new war action movies coming out soon.
Which ones?
Well, particularly, I am interested in Dunkirk.
That does look very good.
I am interested in the action parts, but also to learn more about the events.
I do not know too much about it, but the action parts I have seen in the previews look great.
Most World War II movies that have been made recently have great action scenes.
I would agree, did you see Fury? That was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen the kill bill series?
yes, its pretty awesome.
yea, its so suspensful
i agree, its really good though.
especially when she was buried alive and had to punch her way out of the coffin.
yep, its pretty amazing how she was able to get out.
beatrice was so awesome when she fought.
yea! i love her codename too.
Black manba? it does sound really cool
i know right! it really does!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you watch a lot of action movies?
Yeah I watch a few, not a ton.
Do you have one that you like the most?
I really like Top Gun a lot.
That is a good one.  When was the last time you saw it?
It comes on tv quite a bit.  I saw it a month ago or so.
Yeah that's right.  It still holds up too.
yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
For action movies i really enjoy the matrix
Me too, that movie is so cool
It gives you a totally different perspective on life
Its really neat
Keanu reeves does a great job
Yes he is perfect for the part
Over all they are great movies
Yes, they should have came out with more
They really should have
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Mad Max movie.
Yes, loved it!
yeah, I thought it was good as well.
Charlize Theron was great.
I also liked Tom Hardy.
I heard they used some of the original cast from the first one
Which one?
The bad guy from the original Road Warrior from back in the late 70s
Really? I had no idea
Yeah, I read something about it. Very interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Transporter?
Yes, it is a classic
I really like Jason Statham movies.
He seems to play the same role in each movie
Yea, he is a really good actor when it comes to action movies
He is very tough, I like it.
Being a driver like that seems to be a great fit for him.
He was also good in The Mechanic
Yea, but I liked the original version a bit more
Most originals are way better, but his version was still entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see King Arthur?
I might.
I like the actors.
Who's in it?
The main guy from Sons of Anarchy.
Ooh, he is good. As Arthur.
Yup. And Jude Law.
Who's he going to be?
I'm not sure. Merlin?
That'd be strange.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they're going to make any other Taken movies.
You mean the one with Liam Neeson?
Yeah, you know the one he goes crazy on the bad guys.
I saw it. Great movie, don't mess with him.
If it was my daughter, I'd go nuts too on them.
Well, think you'd need some training first.
Okay , okay. You know what I mean.
Yes, he sure does make them guys pay.
I wouldn't mind having him as my dad.
Me either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love these little movies
What ones
The action movies you know their cartoons
oh like the batman cartoon movies
Yeah the action is very well scripted and done really well
I do think they are pretty good
I mean how often are the movies done so well
Most cartoon action movies are meh
Yeah but the batman ones are amazing
Yep most definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hey there.
Do you like the action genre?
Like for movies?
Yeah.
Sure.
Do you have a favorite?
Yeah sure.  I like Jaws.
Oh yeah a classic.
Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the original Mummy movies?
The ones from decades ago, or the ones with Brendan Frasier?
Those, but keep in mind they WERE decades ago.
Woah...
Yup. So, opinions?
They were a lot of fun and not overly serious.
My favorite part was in the second movie where he runs in late and yells "Nie!!!!"
"Noooooooooo!!!"
That was hilariously bad acting.
The CGI of the scorpion king was just awful, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best Schwarzenegger Action movie?
I have always thought that Terminator 2 is probably his best.
Yeah, that one is good, but I was wondering about his lesser known stuff.
Most of them are pretty weak 80s action plots, but the sure have a lot of action. Have you ever seen The 6th Day
No. What is it about?
It is pretty wild. It is about human cloning.
That sounds cool! Who else is in it?
It has Michael Rappaport and Robert Duvall.
I like Robert Duvall. Wasn't he in Apocalypse Now?
He sure was. He was the surfer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you one of those who is mad that the star of Mad Max wasn't Max?
Yes and no.
Uh-oh, are you about to get sexist?
No. She did a great job in her role.
So what's everyone's issue?
It's called Mad Max, and it's not about Mad Max. It's about Furiosa.
Sort of. It's Mad Max: Fury Road.
That's what I said.
No, it's about the road.
Ooooh, that actually makes sense
XXXXXXXXXXX
...Marvin should have had an opinion.
What now?
Marvin. In Pulp Fiction. He should have had an opinion. That's why he died. He didn't have an opinion.
Yeah Vincent asks him if he thought "God came down and stopped those bullets" and..
..and Marvin says "man I ain't even got an opinion." This triggers Vincent to turn around to ask him again.
..gun in hand...casual conversation..
.."You got to have an opinion! You think that God came down and stopped..." Then bye bye to Marvin's Head.
...gone. One second. A bump in the road. Gone.
He should have just agreed with Vincent. Then Vincent doesn't turn around and shoot him in the face.
Yea, Marvin should have had an opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the 1st Pirates of the Caribean movie?
Yes I have, i love Johnny Depp in it.
I know, he is so cute, especially when he swings on things.
I liked when he was fencing with Will Turner.
Me too, what was his real name?
Orlando Bloom.  He played a good pirate.
Yes and he's cute too, especially when he was running in the cage ball.
I liked when he was 1st seen by Elizabeth as a boy.
Yes and when he was fighting with Jack Sparrow on the rafters.
But Jack Sparrow was cute when he said, "Savvy".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did anyone get to see the Fate of the Furious yet?
I saw it, it was fantastic! I love the cars!!!
Oh yes, that is so much fun to see all those beautiful flying cars!
If I had the money , I would have twenty cars in my garage!
What was the movie about?
Well Dom and his team go into retirement of sorts, but had to be called out of it due to some unexpected villains.
Who is in the movie?
Charlize Theron, Vin Diesel of course, the normal crew, even Kurt Russell was in on this one.
Sounds great, I definitely want to see it.
You should, the cars are amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this director is nuts
Who is
The one hong kong guy
Name names dude
John woo
Oh yeah his action is crazy
it is like balls to the wall action
Some of the most intense heart pounding stuff out there
Yeah i love his movies
He is one of the best directors out there for action
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you haven't seen Edge of Tomorrow: Live, Die, Repeat you should go see it.
Who directed that?
It was Doug Liman.
He made a couple of the best Bourne films right?
Yeah, his Bourne films were really good.
What is it about?
A soldier keeps waking up over and over again and having to fight the same battles to get out of being stuck.
Kind of like Groundhog Day.
Yes, the same concept.
I like that kind of storyline.
XXXXXXXXXXX
transformers is a crap series!
why, i like it
its crap because they do not have consistent main characters
isn't thats what makes a good movie?
the plot is pretty much the same
that is true.
they just keep fighting megatron, who just doesn't die.
that does get annoying now that you mention it.
and now on the new movie. optimus is killing bumblebee
what? thats not right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Ghost in the Shell last weekend.
Oh yea, how was it?
It was better than I thought it was going to be actually.
How was Scarlett Johanssen at playing that character? I know a lot of people were upset that they didn't cast a Japanese actress for that part.
I thought she did a really good job. The role fit her well.
Yea, she's always good in action type of movies.
I can see why they cast her as that part instead of a Japanese actress. I mean she's well known, she's good in those roles and if they want the hype surrounding the movie, then they have to cast someone well known.
Yea, it makes sense. If they cast a lesser known Japanese actress then maybe not so many people would have gone to see it.
It would only be the people who were fans of the original anime and knew the storyline well. By casting Scarlett they kind of open the door for people who didn't necessarily watch the original anime (like me) to be interested in seeing the movie.
Yea it was a smart move.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you excited for the new transformers movie?
Not really, I don't like transformers.
Really? Why not?
It's so commercialized. It's barely even a movie. I can't even understand what's happening on the screen most of the time.
Yea I agree, they've gotten a little crazy with the special effects.
It's dumb, they are just trying to sell cars and toys to people.
I guess so, but it's still pretty epic. The plot is pretty good too.
Not really, in the new one optimus prime turns rogue and they have to stop him. It's dumb.
No its not, that's the same plot they used for the new Fast and Furious.
Yea, exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is hard to choose a favorite action movie or actor.   Which ones do you like?
I liked John Wayne.  He was in hundreds of movies and always came across as the tough guy hero.  Right to the end with "The Shootist"
Yeah he sure did the hero role well.  He was even tempered all the time, just don't cross him.  Heck, a real man was like him for real, Ted williams the ball player.  But he made no movies.  The Duke stuck mostly with westerns and war movies.
He also did some dramatic roles like in the "Quiet Man"  where he was a boxer that retired to the Irish countryside.  That was one of his best roles.
Sure, "The Duke" was one of the greatest of all time and Clint Eastwood sure had a good run of it.
Who could forget his run with the "Dirty Harry" series where he was the tough cop rogue who always took out the worst criminals
Then he always got in trouble with his boss.  His line "Go ahead make my day" was a classic tough guy line used by many afterwards.
Then he had some comedy/action movies with "Every which way but loose".  Pretty funny with the primate co star.  Clyde they called him.
As he got older he leaned to dramatic roles and back to action in "Grand Torino" where he played a dying old man with little more to lose.
He hade the bad guys think he had a gun when he pulled out his lighter and they shot him dead.  A sad ending but he did it for a good cause, defending his unlikely young friend to protect the neighborhood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How'd you like Jason Bourne?
It was OK.
I thought it was great!
The first one was better.
Oh, yeah. Clive Owen was in that one.
He's really good.
Too bad they had to kill him off in the first one.
It was either him or Bourne.
True enough.
But they've had plenty of good antogonists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Do you enjoy action movies?
Yeah sure.
Have a favorite?
Not really, but I do like all of the 80's action movies.
Like Robocop and all that stuff?
Yeah movies like that.
Those take me back to my childhood.
Yeah I feel the same way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Lethal Weapon franchise?
The series?
No, the films.
Oh, I forgot about them. I liked them.
Did you think Danny Glover was a good fit.
I think he was, he matched well with Mel Gisbon.
I liked their chemsitry.
They always had some good jokes in the midst of the explosions and so on.
I liked that they showed Glover with a nice family.
And the other guy, Gibson, as a sort of loose cannon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Lethal Weapon?
I remember seeing it years ago.
I love it so much. Mel Gibson did a great job in that movie.
I agree.  My favorite part is when he was fighting with the bad guy in the movie.
Yeah it was packed with action.
The whole movie was literally packed with action.
Yeah.  I love the whole series of them.
Me to.  I wish they would make more Lethal Weapons.
I don't think they will, the actors are getting to old.
Maybe they can do a spin-off with new actors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie?
Probably Con Air.
Really? Nicolas Cage is in that, right?
He certainly is. He kicks bad guy butt for 90 min, its great.
Nicolas Cage is such a versatile actor, he can do almost anything.
I know what you mean. He can play the hero or the villain.
I like him a tiny bit more as a villian.
What is your favorite bad guy Nicolas Cage role?
I really liked him a lot in Face Off.
Oh, me too. He was super creepy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hey.
Do you watch action movies?
Yeah I watch them sometimes.
Do you have a favorite or favorites?
I like a lot of action movies from the past.
Like 70's and 80's?
Yeah, probably more 80's.
Those always remind me of being a kid and watching them.
Yeah nostalgia has a lot to do with it for me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch the Transformer: Last Knight?
I might, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Michael Bay's work
he's good with visual effects, isn't he?
yea, he also made the movie 13 hours, do you remember that movie?
No, please remind me
it's about a group of soldiers got stranded in Syria and the efforts and sacrifice they made in order to escape
oh, I think I know what you are talking about, yea, it's pretty intense movie
indeed, sometimes I don't even know if there is any CG elements, I suspect Michale Bay used a lot of practical effects
could be, it certainly feels more organic than the effects in Transformer
indeed
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why does every action movie have to have some boring female character?
So that women will go see the movie.
I don't think women want to go see action movies.
They might. That's why they have a female character.
Predator didn't have a female character and it was awesome.
Wasn't the Predator a girl?
I don't think it was.
I thought it was pregnant or something.
Well, if they want to make the Predator the female lead in all action movies I could live with that.
I'd pay to see the Predator in 50 Shade of Grey.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into any like British action films?
I am not even sure what those would be.
Well, Kingsman for one.
With the guy from Pride and Prejudice?
Colin Firth, yes,
I guess that is a British action film. I like it, so yes.
There is that, and the sequel that is about to come out.
I seen that. What other action films are British, or at least set in the UK?
Snatch was one.
With the travelers? I think they portray them wrongly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
You like action movies?
Sure do.
Cool me too.
Do you have one you like the best?
I really love lethal weapon.
Oh nice, that is a classic.
The old buddy cop action movies are my favorite.
I love those.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Clive owens best movie is Shoot Em Up what do you think?
I would say that maybe it was his second best movie
What movie did you think was his best?
Children of Men of course you asked for Action movie so I would probably say Sin City
Oh my god I forgot about Sin City that Frank Miller comic was great
It was a comic?
Yeah it was a graphic novel before it was a movie
Kind of like the walking dead was a graphic novel first
yes exactly I highly recommend picking it up at the comic store
heading that way right after we are done here
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did anyone get to see Transformers: The Last Knight yet?
No, I have not.  It sounds like a thriller action movie.  Did you like it?
I will go see it this Friday.
Who plays in the movie?
Mark Wahlburg, Isabella Moner, and Anthony Hopkins is even in this one.
Sounds like an all star cast.
It is playing down at Crossroads today at 7pm after work.
I wish I could go, but I have a few things I have to work on tonight.
Maybe next time we can go to another movie!
Sounds great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I thought the avengers was a good action movie
Me too
It has non stop action
And its just an amazing movie
It is
Its one of my favorites
Definitely one of mine too
I hope they come out with more
Yea i think theres two
Im ready for a third
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Matrix?
Of course I saw the Matrix, its one of the top movies of all time.
Yea I really loved those movies.
The special effect style of the fight choreography was very original.
Yea, the way they slow-motion dodged bullets was really cool.
Yea it was.
What else did you like about it?
The fighting they did on the cables to make it seem like they were flying around was pretty epic.
Like when Morpheus was training Neo in the dojo?
Exactly, that was awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey buddy you remember that movie Snatched we saw last week?
oh..? you mean the one with Goldie hawn in it?
yeah thats the one! that was a really emotional movie
I know, the part when the mom and his daughter had that moment in the basement brought tears to my eyes!
yeah we will have to rent it again on blu ray, its defiantly worth the price
Yeah.. what  other movies starred Goldie hawn, you know any more?
Let me think... Oh! Death becomes her! that movie was intense
yeah that was a pretty great movie.. to live forever, what a thought right!?
yeah who would want to live forever anyways?
Yeah not me, one lifetime is enough for me
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like action movies in general?
oh yeah, I love them, time for some more explosions
when it comes to visual effects, such as explosion, who comes to your mind first?
it has to be Michael Bay, who's most famous for his Transformer movies, where mass destruction took place
I agree, no matter how others judge the nature of his movies, you can't deny the explosions, haha
so which transformer movie is your favorite?
I believe it was the second one that draws most of my attention, the college kid one
oh, I think I know what you talking about, it's a conspiracy theory about The Pyramid in Egypt, isn't it?
yeah, in the movie, the pyramid has some hidden device that can be used to destroy our sun
that sounds terrifying
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Die Hard franchise.
The Christmas movies?
What? No, the action films.
Yes, but they are Chritmas movies as well.
No, they are action. Police and guns and terror.
All set at Christmas time. An action Christmas movie.
The first one did happen during an office Christmas party.
Yes, and the second one, Christmas time as well.
Well, did you like them.
All I can say is, they are my favorite Christmas action films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Mark, what's the best action movie of all time?
Easy, it's Gladiator. Great hero, great effects, exciting action.
Yeah, great effects, those digital animals in the arena were  amazing! But I preferred those Bruce Willis ones.
You mean all those Die Hard movies. He's gonna be making one when he dies.
And I'm going to be watching that one when I die.
Don't you think he's kind of old for an action hero?
Tom Cruise is too short for an action star, Danny DeVito is too ugly, and Jason Statham is too bad at acting. So what?
Jason Statham is an excellent actor. Did you see his movie War? It's epic.
Nah, I never saw it.
Well, hey, I've got it right here. Let's watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Kong: Skull Island yet?
Yes I have.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was amazing actually, you?
Me too, I really liked how they incorporated the giant animals on the island, that was really cool.
I agree, watching Kong fight with giant monsters was my favorite part.
Do you think they will make a sequel?
I sure hope so, John Goodman and Samuel L Jackson did such a good job in that movie?
Didn't they both die in it though?
I think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hong Kong action flicks are the best.
John Woo is the top director in that genre, I think.
Hard Boiled was the first movie I saw in that genre.
That movie blew me away.
It really cemented Chow Yun-Fat as an action hero.
The fight sequences are shot like a ballet.
I agree. The cinematography is what makes those films.
When did you first see it?
I watched it in the early nineties.
I hope John Woo keeps making them like that for a long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen percy jackson?
Yes they are all good movies
They are cery enjoyable
I love all the quests they go on
Me too
Have you read the books too?
A few of them
I liked them
I enjoyed what i did read
Thats good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Taken movies?
Yes I like them.
I like all of them. They did them all right, I was sad when they killed Lenore off though.
Yes me too.
I like Liam Neeson. I watch a lot of his movies.
Yeah he is pretty cool.
Did you ever see The Other Man?
No.
Really good movie, his wife dies of cancer. After she dies he finds out she was having an affair.
Not his typical kind of movie, but really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lethal Weapon?
Which one?
Any of them
I saw the first one forever ago.
Yeah same here.
Mel Gibson was pretty funny in it.
I didnt mind Danny Glover's character either.
Would you say that was an action movie?
yeah, I mean why not?
Thats what I think too. It was definitely an action comedy in my view
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to see John Wick, Chapter 2?
Yea, but I didn't really like it.
Oh, that's too bad. Why not?
Well, it just wasn't as cool as the first one.
I thought it was better than the first. It had way more assasins in it.
Yea that's true, and that fight scene with Keanu Reeves and Common was pretty good.
Yea! That was awesome.
I guess it wasn't so bad afterall.
Yea, and the next one looks like it will be even better.
That's true, the next could be pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to watch an action movie that is about sports.
I have just the movie for you. Do you like foreign movies?
I do. What is this movie you speak of?
There is a movie called Shaolin Soccer that might be what you are looking for.
That sounds interesting. What happens in it?
A team of misfits goes against some corrupt people.
That sounds great. Is there anything else you can tell me about it?
They defy gravity. The stunts in this movie are insane.
I want to watch this. How do they defy gravity?
They jump hundreds of feet in the air while playing soccer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen mad max?
Yes, it was great.
How about you?
Yes, I saw this movie a few months ago and it was great.
I can't disagree with you on that one.
What did you like about it?
I liked the amount of steady action in the movie.
Yes, it's hard to find great action these days.
Yes, I will have to agree the action was great.
True, the acting was great as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did anyone get to see Jurassic World yet?
Yes, that was fantastic. I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park movies.
Colin Trevorrow the director did an amazing job in this movie.
I didn't realize it was Colin that directed it. Who was the leading woman in this one?
Bryce Dallas Howard played in this one.
That's right, she was great in leading The T rex out of the paddock to kill the one they manufactured!
They kept her running through the whole movie in heals no less!
They made over $529 million dollars on that movie alone.
That is incredible, I know it probably had some awards too.
I am sure they will make theme park rides of it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go to the movies this weekend?
Sure, what are we going to see?
I am not sure, lets look and see whats playing?
lets look for action...Oh "Transformers: The Last Knight" is playing
ok, if you want action, that is the right choice
I hear optimus prime is the bad guy in this
no way, how does that happen I wonder
I dont know, we will see this weekend
I cant wait
me either, I love a good action film
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the final Matrix movie?
Revolutions?
Yup, that one.
It was too preachy.
I think it would have been fine if they didn't rush it.
What do you mean?
Remember, parts 2 and 3 came out in May and November of the same year?
That explains the crap CGI.
The script, too, it was awful.
Could have been less obvious with the Jesus reference, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the second John Wick movie?
Not yet, but I loved the first one!
Almost two hours of headshot after headshot is so awesome!
I heard it has a crazy ending too
I cant spoil it for you though!
I wonder if there will be a third movie!
They imply that there will be.
Oh man, I can't wait!
You need to see the second one though!
Okay I'll watch it tonight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Legends of the Fall.
Wow, that's an oldie.
1994.
Who was in it?
Brad Pitt, Henry Thomas, Anthony Hopkins, and Julia Ormond.
She was a hottie in her time.  Who directed?
Edward Zwick.
He did The Last Samurai.
Right. It has a cool ending, where Brad Pitt gets killed by a bear.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I fanally watched  The Last Boy Scout.
Is that a new movie?
No. That came out in 1991.
Wow, and you just watched it.
Totally forget about movies sometimes, theres so many.
Was Bruce Willis in that one?
Yes, so you know it was good.
Anyone else I know.
Damon Wayans.
I like him, he's a good actor too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is a good action hero?
Jackie Chan, Van Damme, Arnold, and many more.
Can you think of a good Van Damme movie?
Yes, Lionheart is amazing. I also like Cyborg.
Those sound cool.
They are. They are pure action movies.
I've seen Street Fighter. I liked that.
I liked that too. It was a good movie.
What do you think is the best action movie ever?
Terminator for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You big into the Avengers movies?
I thought the first one was okay, but the subsequent ones were a bit much
Oh really, how so?
Well a lot of action and not much acting
Yeah, I guess that's true
Plus too many one-liners and campy characters
Any other comic book action movies that you like?
I really liked the new Logan movie
Oh yeah I heard that one was pretty intense
Yes, rated R and very violent, but I really liked it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the original Terminator film?
Of course! It's one of the best action movies of all time.
Really? Would you say it's the best of the Terminator movies?
It is my personal favorite.
What about Judgement Day? Everyone says that one is better.
It has better special effects and action sequences but doesn't have the charm of the original.
How do you mean?
The low budget, sci-fi setting was a lot more appealing to me than the more polished Judgement Day.
I see. I thought the first one was a little bit campy.
That's part of the charm!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you want to watch a great movie, watch Shoot 'em Up.
Never heard of it.
Clive Owen is in it.
I like that actor.
Yes, his movies are almost always good.
Who else is in it?
Paul Giamatti.
Let me guess, he's a bad guy, right?
Of course, isn't he almost always?
Yes. Well I like both of them, so I'll have to rent it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Con Air?
Probalby my favorite Nicholas Cage film.
That movie had everyone!
Even Dave Chapelle.
He was so funny!
Who played the main villian?
Cyrus?
Yeah.
John Malcovich.
That right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Mummy movies?
Is is action of horror?
It is an action one, a bit of horror, but mostly action.
No, I have not have you?
Yes.
What did you think of it.
It had a lot of action, obviously, but the story line fell.
I like the action, but those type of movies need some kind of story.
This one had none, not really. Just running around and killing mummies.
I do not think I will see it then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Seven Samurai for film class.
Cool, the Kurosawa masterpiece.
Yes, with the great Toshiro Mifune.
Who plays the leader?
Takashi Shimura
He was in Rashomon, too.
You're right.
And who was the girl?
Keiko Tsushima
She was very beautiful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Kill Bill 1 or 2: which do you prefer?
One, for sure.
Why is that?
It has the insane violence with the Crazy 88.
Yeah but it's a bit TOO much and not believable.
I take it you like the second?
Yes.
Why? It's less action, but an action movie!
It has great dialogue, which Tarantino is known for.
Well I'll give you this: at least Bill dies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the new Point Break movie?
No, I heard about it, but didn't see it
I saw it. It was terrible.
Not like the original?
No way, the original was great.
Yeah, I liked the original. Had it all
Yes, action, parachuting, football on the beach.
Football on the beach?
Yeah, that was how Johnny Utah got in with Swayze and gang
Hmmm, I don't remember that scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any foreign action movies?
I've seen The Raid: Redemption.
Oh, that is a great action movie.
It is the action movie I've always wanted.
Why is that?
I've always wanted an action movie with the most minimal amount of plot in favor of being almost nothing but action sequences.
That makes sense. Usually the plot is nothing special in action movies anyways.
Exactly, and all we want to see are cool action set pieces.
Yeah and that movie has nothing but cool action set pieces.
My personal favorite was the scene where the two brothers are fighting Mad Dog.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The latest Jack Reacher film, Never Go Back is so improbable. Reacher is supposedly huge, but actor Tom Cruise is not.
I know, but the worst action movie I ever saw was Contraband. Did you see that one?
Yeah. Mark Wahlberg is an ex-drug-runner who's gonna just do one last job.
Right. Like in Heist, and so many others. Just one last job.
In The Usual Suspects they were doing one last caper.
Great great flick though. I believed it all, all the way through.
How about The Town. It's one last job, and a romance.
Oh yeah. Ben Affleck, he was totally believeable.
Yeah. A great actor, in any role.
The Italian Job was one last job, both the first version and its remake. And its sequel was The Brazilian Job. No rest for the wicked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Magnificent Seven last night on DVD.
The reboot?
Yes, not the 1960 version with Yul Brynner.
Who directed?
Antoine Fuqua.
Who plays the leader?
Denzel Washington.
Who is the side kick?
Chris Pratt.
I hope it was as good as the original.  Probably not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you know what's really a good action movie?  Hot Fuzz.
Really?  Don't think I've seen that one.
Yeah, I mean, for the first two actions, it's played up like a mystery/horror film with comedic elements, but then it Act III it goes into over-the-top Michael Bay style action.
Oh, not Michael Bay!  Getting tired of the Transformers movies.
No, no, this was made back when his biggest things were Bad Boys 2 and Point Break.  So, they movie does a lot of send up of those films.
Oh, that sounds fun.
Oh, yeah, there's a scene for instance where the main character and bad guy are fighting in a replica model of the village, so they shoot it like something out of a Godzilla movie.
Hahaha.
Another good one is how mainly of the lines they exchanged with characters previously in the film and respoken later one to give them extra meaning.
Oh, yeah, like a neat little call-back/
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Ghost Protocol?
Yeah, that was the best Mission Impossible they've put out for a while.
I really liked Jeremy Renner.
He was good, but Simon Pegg was better.
Best little techy in the business!
Ha! He's just so funny.
Action movies are best with a little comic reliefe.
Yeah, you need something to break up the tention.
The next chapter wasn't so great.
I hadn't seen it yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which do you think was better out of these two movies? The first or second John Wick movies?
I honestly preferred the second John Wick movie.
I did as well. The mannerisms Keanu Reeves had in the second John Wick movie were really odd.
Yeah and so was the story line in some ways. I feel like the second one should of been the prequel.
Indeed. The second John Wick movie felt like it needed to end on a cliffhanger to have another sequel just to do well.
I still liked the soundtrack score for both movies.
The soundtrack for this action movies was one of the better ones for sure.
It reminded me of some of the video games that become movies like Max Payne.
What did you think of the action movie Max Payne?
I liked it a lot but it left me wanting sequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like action movies.
Yeah sure.
What are your top 3.
Oh, tough question.
Sure think about it.
Top Gun, Terminator, Terminator 2
Those are great choices.
Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Sylvester Stallone?
Yeah I do.
Did you like him in Rocky?
Yes I love Rocky I seen all the movies.
Me too I like when he beat the Russian.
Yes he was tough to beat. It was a shame he killed his buddy.
It sure was. I am glad Rocky got him.
Did you like him in the Expendables?
Yes I did. I seen all but the new one.
The new one is good you should watch if you get time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That was horrible! What happened to action films?
I know. The last one I really loved was Tomb Raider.
Tomb Raider, really? The one based on the game?
Exactly that one. Angelina Jolie was great in it.
I remember the sequel, too, The Cradle of Life.
There was supposed to be a third one, I think, but it got cancelled.
I loved that U2 song that they used for the theme.
That whole film was great. Did you know Angelina did most her own stunts?
That's insane! She must be really dedicated.
Oh, yeah, I'm a big fan!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie?
I love Die Hard.
That's a great film!
Yeah, especially since it's a great Christmas movie.
Hahaha, that's so true.
What's your favorite action movie?
I'm a big fan of The Mummy actually.
Really? What do you think about Tom Cruise being in the new one then?
I'm sad because I love Brendan Fraser.
Yeah, but I bet he'll take the action to the next level.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Cyborg?
I thought it was a terrific action flick
Did Jean-Claude Van Damme ever have a bad movie?
Never. They were all some of the best action movies ever.
Did you like Bloodsport?
Yes, it was fantastic. He was great in that one.
When did that one come out?
In 1988
Who directed it?
Newt Arnold.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action sequence
I am not sure
Well you wanna know mine
Sure i am cool with that
Well my favorite is a star wars scene
Which one
I love the action sequence where darth maul fights Qui Gon
That is the best part of the movie
It is and it is not a bad movie
That is a little to far
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action film?
The new Mad Max, Fury Road.
I loved that movie. Tom Hardy is incredible.
Hardy is always good in my books. Charlise theron was also very powerful in her performance.
Furiosa is a kick ass role for any women, but glad charlize was the one to land it.
I can't say enough about this film, the pacing was so fun. A true action packed movie.
It was like an adrenaline rush the entire time.
I think so also. I feel the score really added to the vibe and anxiety you felt the entire time.
To some degree  yes but I think the stakes were also so high. George Miller the director was very skilled at depiciting this.
I think this is George Miller's masterpiece , not sure he will ever be able to top it. But I would love to see him try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to watch an action movie that will make me think.
Are you a fan of Guy Ritchie?
I loved the movie Snatch.
He made a great movie called Revolver.
That sounds interesting, is it about a gun?
Not quite. There are definitely guns but it is more about enlightenment if you read between the lines.
How do they manage that?
The movie is about a man discovering that his ego controls him.
That sounds intense. How does he resolve this?
He goes to his biggest enemy and apologizes to him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie franchise?
Marvel hands down.
I like Pirates of the Caribbean.
Both franchises are great.
What action movie do you hate?
I hated Jupiter Ascending.
I don't like the Matrix because the first was good but the next two ruined it.
I like old action movies as well.
Me too I like the Terminator.
I prefer the Die Hard movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Dirty Harry, the movie?
Yes, that was a great movie, Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite actors.
Mine too, his movies are action packed.
He was in a lot of them, did you ever see The Good, The Bad and the Ugly?
Yes, I did , that was one of my favorite movies.
Mine too, it was full of action.
His movies are consistently good, never saw a bad one.
That is true.
I hope he comes out with another soon.
I do too, Clint Eastwood is one great actor, a classic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Mad Max?
Yes, I loved it. Mel Gibson is great.
Did he direct that one?
No, he did not.
He is a great director too.
I agree. Braveheart is a masterpiece.
Did you see The Road Warrior?
Yes
Which did you like better?
I preferred The Road Warrior to Mad Max.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Taken movies were there?
Not sure. I know I only saw two, but don't know if they made a third.
I'll have to Google that and see.
Don't know if I'd watch another. They can only go so far with those movies.
That's true.
Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor though.
He is very believable.
Yes, he plays his parts great.
I wouldn't mess with him.
Me either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action movies with a love story built in.
I think most action films have one.
Like what?
Well, all of them usually. Even Rambo.
Wow, I just noticed it does.
Yep. All the Rambo movies had lots of guns and a bit of love too.
I wonder why?
Maybe to keep the plot more than just non stop action.
I think the Matrix did that well.
Yep, mostly action, but a little love too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action films?
I love them!
What is your favorite?
Well, for new ones, I would say Logan.
The Marvel one?
Yes, it was full of action.
Was it not like any other Marvel film?
No, it was more like a cop show, lots of killing and action, but a hint of mutant.
Was it very gory?
It was rated R for good reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Jason Bourne franchise.
Yeah, me too.
Matt Damon really turned the spy genre upside down with that one.
How so?
He created a spy that had human flaws and wasn't perfect.
I can see how that is true.
The first one in the series is my favorite.
Mine too.
We really get to know Matt Damon's character for the first time.
I agree and the action sequences were remarkable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so thrilled that the Wonder Woman movie is doing so well at the box office. Have you seen it?
No, but I want to. I love action movies and super hero flicks.
I'm a big action movie fan, too.
I want to see The Mummy, too.
I can't believe Tom Cruise is still bankable as an action hero at his age.
Well, age is just a number. He keeps himself in ridiculous shape.
Plus, action movies are mostly CGI now.
I guess. I wish they'd revive the Die Hard series.
That would be amazing. I love Die Hard.
I just watched the first Die Hard movie recently. It never gets old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the last Mummy movie yet?
No, I have not. What was it like?
Not sure, I have not seen it either, but I plan on going this weekend.
I have seen the reviews and they look pretty low.
Tom Cruise plays in this one, and hos movies usually are fantastic.
Yes it surprised me the reviews.
The Mummy has some strange looking makeup for the character that plays the Egyptian mummy.
Yes, Alex Kurtzman directed this movie. THe visual effects look like it will be a block buster.
I hoep the critcs are wrong on this one. I want to go this weekend.
Enjoy it, and let me know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Die Hard for the first time in years recently.
The break through performance that made Bruce Willis a household name.
I totally forgot the dad from the Family Matters show was in it.
Yeah he was the cop that liked to eat Twinkies.
I gotta say Die Hard was still surprising good after all this time.
If you liked Die Hard you should check out Escape from New York.
I think i remember that movie. Is it the one with the guy that wears an eye patch.
Yup Kurt Russell played Snake Plissken in it.
Next time i have some free time i'm a check it out.
There's also a follow up called Escape from L.A that is worth seeing as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What type of action movies do you like?
A combination of recent releases to those released a few years ago.
Can you give me a couple from a few years back?
RED, RED2, Slevin
What makes those your favorite?
Bruce Willis
What about more up to date?
Iron Man, Thor and The Avengers
If you could be an Avenger (from the movies) who would you want to be?
Nat..........That girl can kick A--!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still think enter the dragon is the best action movie to grace films
I mean i will give you it is a classic
it is THE classic
I did like it
I still rewatch it every year
I pretty much do the same
Shame what happened
What do you mean
He died duh
Oh yeah that is a shame
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, I wish Arnold was still making action movies. Nobody had lines like him.
Yeah, but wasn't he in one recently?
I don't know, maybe they did some remake. Weren't they going to remake T2?
How could they remake that? "I cannot self-terminate."
That is the best line! That molten metal dude was pretty cool too.
That was the terminator sent to kill Arnold! They had some great effects for the time.
Yeah, I remember that scene when the metal blobs join together and turn into the bad cop.
That cop had an evil look to him. I wonder what the real cops thought.
I bet all cops like Arnold.
They should make a film where he is now a police chief who gets down and dirty on the front lines.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the advert for the new Transformer movie?
It was just action packed. Do you think the film will be as well?
I think so.
The last ones were not so good.
They had too much going one in them.
The plot was just too confusing.
The new one, some of the good guys go bad.
Optimus Prime goes bad right?
Yes, he wants to kill all humans so the autobots can have the earth.
I wonder if in the movie he will go good again?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the weakest Action movies of all time?
Weakest?
Yeah. The most lame action movie.
That's hard to say because if the action is weak, then it is no longer considered an action movie.
Good point.
However, if I had to choose just one, I would choose "The Last Action Hero"
Was that the one with Arnold?
Yah. Pump me up.
Why that movie?
It had seriously lame action scenes, totally unbelievable villians, and yet it still had the guts to put the word "Action" in the title!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Pult Fiction?
Yes I did.
You should watch it again.
Ok I will.
Yes, look for the great action scenes that take place.
Ok I remember the scene with the sword and the motorcycle.
Yes those are great scenes.
I want to watch that film again.
Yes, if you havent seen it twice, it is worth watching again.
Ok thanks for the reminder.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Snatch?
That sounds like an interesting movie. What is it about?
It is a Guy Ritchie movie about a bunch of criminals.
That sounds fun. Why should I check it out.
It gives you a good look into the criminal underground in the United Kingdom.
Cool. I think I might check it out. Is anyone I know in this?
Have you heard of Brad Pitt?
Yes. He was so good in Inglorious Bastards.
He plays a boxer in this.
Wow. I am definitely watching this now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is you favorite Lethal Weapon movie?
I'd have to say Lethal Weapon 3.
Why's that?
Because it has both Leo Getz, a Martin Riggs love interest just as tough as him, and Riggs in his fun kind of crazy persona.
Okay, but you have to admit Lethal Weapon 2 also had crazy fun Riggs.
True, ture, but then, after Reika's killed and he finds out the South African's killed his wife, he goes all death wish Martin Riggs again.
Yeah, but he's a little like than in number 3 as well.
When?
When he has that crazy happy look on his face, as open's the door of the armored car, so he can wail on the driver.
Yeah, he defintely looks a little psycho when he does that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action movies?
I love action movies.  Especially the 90's etc.
I loved action movies with Arnold, Stallion, Van Damn, and Segal.
What about Blade, with Wesley Snips?
Those were awesome movies.  He kicked ass in them.
I also am a big fan of Jason Stathem, Jet Lee, Jackie Chan, etc.
Good call, those guys are great.  I love Stathem in the last Fast and Furious movie.
He was funny in it and kicked the hell out of everyone.
The Rock is one of my favorite all time action heroes.
He was good in the fast and furious movies, Central Intelligence, etc.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched two Lethal Weapon movies this weekend.
A blast from the past.
Yes, comedy and lots of action.
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were great in those movies.
They were. Can't picture any other actors being in those movies.
They were so young.
Joe Pesci was funny in the second one.
He was a cooky character.
They should make one in the current day.
They should. It would still be a good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the commercial for the transformers movie?
Is that the 4th one?
No, it's the 5th one!
I don't even think I have seen the 3rd one.
We should watch it on fire stick this weekend.
Okay. Does it have Shia LaBeouf in it?
The third one does but the new one has Mark Wahlberg in it.
I love Mark! Maybe even more than LaBeouf.
Me too, I thought Ted was hilarious.
Eh, it wasn't my favorite I liked The Perfect Storm.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen John Wick?
No, but I';ve heard some about it. What's the plot?
John is a former assassin for the Russian mob, who left the life to marry the woman he loved.
So what happens to make go all killer elite again?
Less than week after his wife dies, the idiot son of his former boss, invades his home, beats him, kills his dog, and steals his car.
That wasn't a smart move, wasn't it?
No, John was a legend in the underworld and the Russian's called him Baba Yaga, or the Boogeyman
So, the kid is out of luck and time?
Yep, John can kill anybody the send and get past anybody they have try to protect the little putz.
Okay, now I defintely want to see this movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Transformer The Last Knight movie comes out today.
Wow, I cant wait to see that movies.
Me too, i love Michael Bay and what he has done for the Transformer brand.
Now that he has Mark Wahlberg staring in the move you forget about the other guys.
Yeah, So who were the other guys again?
It was Shia Labeouf and the hot chick Megan Fox.
I hear that Megan Fox is a big diva.
i hear that too, but she is still super hot.
I guess your right i am going to get my ticket for the move. Do you want to ride.
Sir, i am read to check out this move.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have the best action film for you.
What is it?
It is called the Chinese Connection.
Oh what is it about.
It is starring Bruce Lee.
Oh really I know of him.
Yes the film is a complete movie.
Is it really?
Yes and it is heavy on the excellent martial arts action.
Great, I will watch it then, thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Terminator 2?
Yes I actually saw it with my dad when it came out in theaters.
Wow that was a long time ago. What did you think of it?
I thought it was far better than the first.
Right that's because special effects had evolved a lot since the 80's.
That's true. What's your favorite scene of the movie?
Definitely the motorcycle and truck chase between Arnold Schwarzenegger and the T-1000.
That's my favorite too. Probably one of the greatest chases in history period.
I agree. Edward Furlong did a great job for that being his breakout role.
He really did. It's too bad we haven't seen him in much since then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the latest action film you saw?
I watched Logan this past weekend!
How was it?
Really good! Hugh Jackman is a great actor.
Do you like the other X-Men films?
Yes, but this one was the most emotional
.So how was the action?
There was a lot, but the story was great too.
Wow, I'll have to see it.
The acting is top-notch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Matrix movie?
The third one!
You're joking!
I actually am.  I would probably go with Part 2.
For me, the original was the best.  The gunfights were awesome in it.
Sure, but the second one had the freeway battle.
Yeah, that was probably the best set piece of the entire series.
It must have cost a fortune to film.
Well, I think they built their own freeway section to actually film it?
Really?  That's incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of fight club?
that movie is amazing.
everyone loves it. its a crazy movie.
in that time, i think the only action film i like better is the matrix
red pill or the blue pill?
i want the truth. i'll be the chosen one.
I think i agree too.
I wanna look like keanu dodging those bullets
and those fighting skills too
The fights were crazy cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the taken movies?
Yes i love them
Me too
I love liam nelsen too
Hes a great actor
And so great for the part
Hes perfect in these movies
He is they suit him so well
He makes the movies
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Gladiator?
The one that won best picture in 2000?
Yup, with Russel Crowe.
Yes, and my marching band performed the music from it.
What did you think?
Honestly, it did NOT deserve best picture.
Why not?
Well, the action is great, but the rest is awful.
Did you think he was the right actor?
Yes, he portrayed him well, but he's supposed to be Spanish but doesn't have an accent!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Hot Fuzz?
Oh, yeah!
What a great flick!
Yeah, just the righ mix of action and comedy.
And what a great villian.
Timmothy Dalton?
Yeah, I thought I'd never forgive him for his portral of Bond.
That was pretty lacluster.
You can say that again!
He plays the villian well, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The all-time best action movie ever made is actually a remake. It's The Magnificent Seven.
Oh yeah, I love that flick. Seven heroes ride into town, and save all the little people.
That's true, but first you get to know them one by one. Yul Brenner is introduced as the cagey old gunslinger Chris Adams.
Un-huh. Then Steve McQueen plays Vin Tanner, who loses his shirt gambling, and signs up.
Then there's Charles Bronson, playing Bernardo O'Reilly, who's down and out.
No, you left out Brad Dexter, who plays the conniving Harry Luck.
Okay, then we see James Coburn demonstrate his knife and gun skills as Britt.
Great stuff. Next we meet gentleman Robert Vaughn, plays Lee, who's afraid he's a coward.
And the last to join up is the tag-a-long kid Chico, played by Horst Buchholtz, who wants morethan anything to be a gunslinger.
Then they all ride into town, and save the day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a good John woo action movie last week.
Oh yeah, which one.
The Replacement Killers.
That movie had Mia Sorvino in it.
Yes, it did.
I thought that not only was the action good, but it was well scripted.
I noticed that also. The storyline was interesting.
You can't beat a John Woo film for action.
Yeah, it feels like you are actually in the movie when you watch it.
Hong Kong style action cinema is the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that they're making a new Bond movie.
That's great. I love Bond.
What did you think of SPECTRE
At first I was only liked it a little, but I rewatched it and liked it more a second time
Yeah, some of the political things really foreshadowed today didn't it.
Well, that's what good Bond has always done.
What's your favorite Bond film?
I think it's Moonraker
Oh, so you're a Roger Moore guy.
Actually I liked Connery more in the role, but I still love Moonraker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer Terminator 1, or 2?
I love part 2, but part 1 is the best.
Why is that?
I prefer Arnold as a bad guy. It was cool to see him not as the hero.
I agree. But, part 2 was pretty cool.
Yeah, that liquid bad guy was cool.
Part 1 had a cooler story. Plus, that night club scene was terrific.
Do you like other Arnold movies?
Yeah, Predator, Kindergarten Cop, Conan are all amazing.
They are. I love his movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Wonder Woman?
I did not.
Well let me tell you it was the bomb.
Like in bad?
No it was packed full of action.
So she did a good job?
Yes and she kept up the pace well
Will we see a new one?
Yes thats true we will definitely see that
Good because I need to see the first one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the Die Hard movies?
I used to be but it's been so long since I've seen one of them. I saw the one where they foiled the Russians' plans.
Oh that's the one where Bruce Willis spent the entire time with a headache.
Yes it really made you feel his pain. He's just a great action star all around.
Have you seen him in Pulp Fiction?
Of course I have. Loved him in that too.
Quentin Tarantino is an excellent action director. Have you seen Kill Bill?
I most certainly have. My favorite scene in part 1 is when she went on a killing spree in that club where O-Ren Ishii was.
That was a killer scene, literally. No holds barred there.
I heard they made most of that scene black and white because there was too much gratuitous blood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love all the taken movies
Me too
"I dont know who you are..."
Thats classic
They were so good
They were, they need to make more of those
I would watch them
Same here
I own them all
I want to buy them
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like will smith in his action roles
They are a bit different than what i am used to
I know it is a bit off kilter
huh
You know odd seeing him in those roles
Well yeah he is know as funny man
And then he plays these action roles so well though
True he played deadshot perfecty
It was the best part of the movie
Without a shadow of a doubt
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch action movies?
Yes i love them
I liked the mummy movies
Those were good
Do you plan on watching the new one?
Yes i cant wait to see it
Me either
I was excited when i heard about it
Me too i didnt know they were coming out with anymore
Me either
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the terminator Genysis?
I think it was a far cry from the old one.
Well, they did change the whole time line about a dozen times.
The feel was off though, not just the plot.
I liked Matt Smith in it.
He was really good, I was surprised when he turned into a bad guy.
He was a sleeper cell, he was bad the whole time.
I was surprised by his being bad in general.
Do you think they will make new ones?
I think they already are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Raiders of the Lost Arc?
Yes, it is a classic Spielberg movie.
Did you know the character was named after George Lucas's dog?
No, I did not
When did it come out?
1981
Is that before Star Wars?
No, Star Wars was 1977
Are there any other Raiders movies?
Yes, quite a few actually.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is a great action hero?
Van Damme
Oh yea, I love his movies
Did you see Universal Soldier?
Yes, it was amazing.
What did you like about it?
I loved the costumes and the story was great.

I just saw Jason Bourne.
Neat.  Who was the director?
Paul Greengrass.
Anybody in the movie?
Julia Stiles is in it but she gets killed.
Too bad.  She was great in the series.
Tommy Lee Jones does a good job.
How about Alicia Vikander?
Yes, she is great as Heather Lee.
Very hot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see they remade 'The Mummy'?
Yeah, with Tom Cruise?
That's right. Seems kind of soon to do a remake.
That's what I thought - the original didn't come out that long ago.
I guess Hollywood is struggling for good action movies. Have you seen reviews?
I have, and they're not great.
That's what I thought. Everyone is sick of remakes.
Not even Tom Cruise can save it - he isn't a box office pull anymore.
Yeah, in the 90s he was the ultimate action movie hero.
Tom Cruise did do a lot of great action movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you heard of  avatar?
is that the one with the tall blue people?
yea, that's the one, did you watch it/
yes, i did, its a very long movie, but very good
i know i loved it.
its pretty sad though, when their tree gets destroyed.
i know, but i love it when he was transferred into his alien body.
that was a very beautiful part in the movie.
they shoud make a sequel to the movie.
i agree, it would probalbly make a lot of people happy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Enter the Dragon?
No I did not.
It is Bruce Lees magnum opus.

It is filled with amazing action.
Ok I look forward to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Clint Eastwood. Did you ever see Gran Torino?
Yes that was a great movie.
It was sad at the end though.
Yes I cried at the end.
The car was nice in the movie also.
Yes would love to have that car.
What about Million Dollar Baby?
Another sad but good one.
Yes Clint was the only one she had her family treated her really bad.
Sad she had to die over the that low blow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action films?
Yes, very much.
Which one is your favorite?
The Matrix
Is that the one with Keanu Reeves?
Yes, it's awesome.
What is it about?
A guy in a computer simulation realizes the world is an illusion.
Does he escape?
Yes, and then he has all sorts of challenges to overcome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like James Bond movies?
Yeah, those are classics.
What's your favorite Bond film?
I liked Goldeneye alot.
Who played that Bond again?
Pierce Brosnan played Bond in that one.
Oh, it's hard to keep track of all the Bonds.
I know they always seem to be changing.
I think Daniel Craig is the most recent Bond.
Casino Royale was a great movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The French Connection.
Number 1 or 2?
Number 1.
Gene Hackman is great in that.
Roy Scheider wasn't bad, either.
Who was the French crime lord?
Fernando Rey, in a distinguished performance.
Neat.  I forget the director.
William Friedkin.
Wow, who can forget The Exorcist?
XXXXXXXXXXX
My son likes Harrison Ford. Did you like the Indiana Jones movies?
Yes they were ok.
Some people say he was good in Star Wars but we never seen Star Wars yet.
Really never?
No. We will have to watch.
Did you watch him in the Fugitive?
Yes my son liked that one.
He was set up and had to go on the run. Tommy Lee Jones was good in that too.
Yes I like Tommy Lee Jones. He was good in No Country for Old Men.
Yes that is a great movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recommend any good action movies for us?
You mean a new one or old?
Doesn't matter.
Have you seen the movie Hitman?
I don't think so. Who's in it?
Timothy Olyphant is the main actor.
No, never watched it. Is it new?
No. Actually it's from 2007.
Is there a lot of action?
Sure is. He is a great actor too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Karate Kill?
I think so, is that the one where the guy's sister gets kidnapped?
Yea that's the one! It was pretty crazy huh?
Yea, it was kind of weird though.
Why did you think it was weird?
It was just kind low budget.
Yea that's true, but the fighting was so cool!
Yea the fighting was amazing.
I hope they come out with a part 2.
Yea, so do I!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.
Who is the director?
Matt Reeves.
Who plays Caesar?
Andy Serkis.
Any big name star?
Gary Oldman.
Who plays Caesar's wife, Cornelia?
Judy Greer.
She's a good actress.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot stand some directors
Like who
Ones that ruin franchises
What franchise was ruined
Transformers
How was it ruined
Michael bay turned it into explosions the movie
But they are cool
Not it is lame
Whatever you say
XXXXXXXXXXX
Indiana Jones is my favoeite action movie.
What was the best parts of Indiana Jones?
:Remember when the bad guy pulls out 2 swords and start swinging them in a crazy way?   Yeah, Indiana just pulls out his gun a shoots him.
Hilarious.
What was  your favorite part?
When the bad guys open the Ark even though Indy told them not to and their faces melted.
Yeah, I think Indiana covered his eyes right?
Yes that's why he lived.
Speilberg's the best.
Yes, for a while all he did was make hits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the movie Power Rangers?
I felt like it was terrible. I don't understand why people enjoyed it so much.
I feel like the action scenes in Power Rangers were too generic.
They were too generic and also it seemed like the movie was trying too hard to be Politically Correct.
I did like seeing some background information on the character Rita Repulsa though.
It was interesting to find out she was once a Green Ranger.
Do you think they will make a Power Rangers Two?
Maybe. I am not sure though if I would go see it.
What did you think of  the fighting style of the Power Rangers?
It was alright but it could of been better with more believable action scenes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what action movie we watched last night.
I don't know. There's so many.
Your favorite one, Die Hard.
With Bruce Willis. Yes a favorite.
That movie is just great. It will never be boring no matter how many times you watch it.
I love it. John McClain, a classic character.
Did you like the second one too.
Is that the one in the airport?
Yes.
Yeah, that one was great too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2?
No, I have not. What was it like?
I saw it Sunday, and it was fantastic. It got 8 out of 10 stars for the reviews.
What is this one about plot wise?
Peter Quill and his fellow Guardians are hired by a powerful alien race, the Sovereign, to protect their precious batteries from invaders.
I saw some commercials on tv about it, and the director did a nice job with the special effects.
Yes, and Groot is in it as well, a smaller version of course.
Who stars in this one?
Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Zoe Zaldana, Brad Cooper again are in this one.
Sounds great, I want to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see James Cameron may be redoing RoboCop?
No theres no way that can be true.
The movie was not that bad.
Yeah but I dont think he wants to go down that road
He usually does write novel type of movies.
Yeah I loved RoboCop too
They had great fight scenes.
It was really simple for its time
Yet was able to captivate audiences with the various ways they did effects.
I just think you leave it alone, it wasnt a supreme movie enough to get a director back like that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Road to Perdition?
Yes I loved that movie what a job Tom Hanks did
I was so sceptical of Tom Hanks as a ganster but was pleasentkly surprised
I know he was amazing in the movie
The plot was incredible and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire movie.
My favorite part was when Tom Hanks killed the mob boss on the street
Yeah what a line Paul Newman said when he realized what was happenning "I am glad it was you"
Talk about chills what a moment
The end was so surprising too you thought Tom Hanks and his son were in the clear than bang the hitman shoots Tom Hanks in front of his son Michael.
The whole movie just blew me away. I can watch it over and over
XXXXXXXXXXX
James Franco is one of my favorite actors. Did you see 127 hours?
No I haven't seen that one.
If you get a chance watch it, it is pretty good.
I will have to do that.
What about the Spider Man movies with him in?
Yes I liked them.
He was great in them. I also liked Tobey McGuire.
The Spider Man movies weren't the same after Tobey left.
I know I liked them better with him.
When they change the movies up with different actors they aren't the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you think the later Terminators were better than the older ones?
I  mean, story wise, maybe.
What did you think of the second one?
Judgement Day?
Yes, what did you think of it?
The plot played better, not as much action.
Really? The Terminator exploding building not enough?
It had action, just more back story.
I liked the story of Connor's mom.
How she came to be the mother of the chosen one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We haven't seen Heat in a while.
You want to watch it?
Yeah, let's do that this weekend.
What an amazing cast.
Deniro, Paccino, Killmer...
I think Val was my favorite.
He hasn't done anything for a while.
I wonder what happened to him.
He's really good.
Maybe he's just taking a break.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Sylvester Stallone fan?
Oh yeah, I like Rambo alot.
Oh, I haven't seen that one.
He's a Commando who kills everyone in the forest.
It's always fun seeing those types of movies.
Yeah, it's cool how muscular he is.
I don't think the movie would have been as good with a skinny actor.
There were tons of action stars in the 80s who were massive.
Van Damme, Arnold were some of my favorites.
Those are my favorites as well. They don't have many of those actors now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen John Wick 2 yet?
No, I have not.  It sounds like an action movie.  Did you like it?
I have not seen it, but plan on going to see it.  I liked the first movie quite a bit.
Who plays in it?
Keanu Reeves, Ruby Rose, Ian McShane to name a few.
Is this one as detailed as the first movie?
Retired super-assassin John Wick's plans to resume a quiet civilian life are cut short!
No doubt, John Wick will probably always be in that business!
I heard it was action packed, and full of violence.
We should go see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of Vin Diesel's movie?
Oh yes, I love the Fast and the Furious and its sequels
I really liked the first three of those movies.
The car chases were so exciting that I could not look away.
Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, is also in several of those films.
I think he's great. He can do action and he can do comedy.
He was great in San Andreas. Disaster movies are some of my favorite action films.
Did you like The Day after Tomorrow?
That movie had excellent special effects.
I've never seen it, but maybe I will check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen baader meinhof the movie?
No I have not.
It is one of the most amazing action films.
Oh is it?
Yes it shows a guerilla revolution movement in Germany.
Wow that sounds unique.
It is really special.
Ok I will watch it.
It is filled with great action.
Thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies?
Probably the middle one with the Joker.
The Dark Knight?
Yep.  They were all good, but that was the cake of the series.
I would agree with you there.  Heath Ledger's performance was an all-timer.
He was so creepy in it.  It's a shame he never got back in time for another one.
The ending scene was so shocking though.  I actually thought the kid might get it.
That's good movie-making in general.  They threw everything at it creatively.
I wonder if they'll ever re-explore those movies with Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Unlikely, but you never know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw John Wick for the first time.
Cool.  Keanu Reeves?
Yes, plus Bridget Moynahan, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe.
She was hot in Coyote Ugly.
Right.  It was a pretty cool movie.  Violent.
What happens in the movie?
A hired killer goes after mobsters who steal his car and kill his dog.
What role does Dafoe play?
Reeves' mentor.
Wow, sounds exciting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love action movies
Is it your favorite
I think they might be
Why
It is just unrelenting
Well that is interesting
What is your favorite
I love comedies
Do you like action comedies
Sure why not
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like martial arts movies?
They are pretty good.
I would check out Drunken Master.
Who is in that?
Jackie Chan plays a martial artist who fights while drunk.
I love Jackie Chan! When did this come out?
A long time ago. It's a classic movie with hilarious dubbing.
Jackie Chan is so nice. I would love to meet him.
There is a reason he is as famous as he is.
I wish more people were like Jackie Chan!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Die hard 1 will always be one of my favorite action movies!
I know what you mean, especially considering the rest of them. Under siege is also a classic.
I agree, die hard on a boat!
Exactly, Steven sepals when he was actually good!
But what about hardcore Henry, that was an amazing action film.
That was great, it’s the first time I have ever seen a movie like that, it was like watching a video game.
Yes, it was must have been a nightmare to film. And you never see his face.
Exactly, you never really know who he is. The way he beats everybody to get to the boss was great.
Yes and it had a great twist as well with the girlfriend.
Yes, I truly did not see that coming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?
Yes, it was awesome! Have you seen it?
Yes, and it is my new favorite movie! I love how Marvel brings to life these charaters.
Me too! The battles were epic and the are like the outlaws of the space world.
Precisely! It fun because the crew reminds me of a motley crew.
Right, without getting specific, this father-son dynamic, is the driving force behind the tension in the movie.
Yes and that goes along with the original movie and stays with the theme we are used to.
What about that Baby Groot!
Baby Groot steals the show with his big eyes and sweet demeanor.
The movie has every aspect of being a great movie to take teenage kids to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to come watch The Dark Knight?
Heck yes, I love that movie!
Me too, I must have watched it one hundred times.
I was never really a fan of Heath Ledger until The Dark Knight.
I don't know, he was pretty good in "10 Things I Hate About You."
Are you serious right now?
Kinda.
You would say something like that.
Seriously, I agree though, his role as the Joker was awesome.
I know it was. I've seen every Batman movie and none of them can hold a candle to this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the hunger games movies?
Yes they are good
I really like them too
Did you read the books?
Yes i read all the books and eatched all the movies
I was suprised the movies werent horrible
Me too
I really liked watching them
Me too
Thank you
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Kill Bill on demand.
No. 1 or 2?
1.
Wasn't Sonny Chiba cool?
Yes, but i loved Darryl Hannah.
The patch made her look awesome.
Lucy Liu was great.
Uma Thurman looked fabulous.
I'm going to watch 2 tonight.
That's a great idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Indiana Jones movie?
Probably Raiders of the Lost Ark.
What makes it your favorite?
Probably the whole classic snake pit and Indy's struggling to deal with it.
Yeah, it makes you feel for the guy! I like The Last Crusade.
It's a classic - and the whole "choose wisely" scene - I love it.
I know! Every time I watch that whole part I'm tense, even though I know how it will turn out.
Do you know where they shot those scenes?
I'm afraid I don't know.
That's a bummer. But it's beautiful, no matter where it is!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was flipping through channels last night and found the movie The Rock.
What is that one?
A great action movie with Nick Cage and Sean Connery.
I remember that one.
Good movie. I ended up watching it again.
Sean Connery is such a great actor.
Ed Harris isn't bad, but seems he's always a bad guy.
He does. He does do a lot of good action movies.
Yes, but Nick Cage is better in movies.
I have to agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the first Magnificent Seven movie.
The Yul Brynner one?
Yes, 1960.
I remember watching it.
It was based on a Japanese movie.
No kidding. Which one?
Seven Samurai, directed by Kurosawa. C
I didn't know that!
Yes, with Toshiro Mifune.
He is a cool actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen "Snatched" with Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn?
Yes, it was kind of stupid. Goldie Hawn was not funny.
I didn't think so either.  But Amy was good.
Yes, i like the way she runs around telling the kidnappers off.
And they kept getting caught too.
Why were they out in the jungle anyways?
She met that guy who was showing her around.
Oh yeah and he was in on the kidnapping in the first place.
Thats the guy she slept with and danced with.
At the end it was ok when mom and daughter hugged. Otherwise it was a stupid movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the movie Collide the other night.
That's the one with Nicholas Hoult and Felicity Jones right?
Yeah I've become a huge fan of Nicholas since his role as the War Boy in Mad Max Fury Road. I'm also a huge fan of Felicity Jones since Like Crazy and recently Rogue One.
Is this an action movie or a romance?
It's starts as a romance but it's a pure action movie. I was surprised when I found out Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were also in this!
Wait, I didn't know Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins were in this!
Ben Kingsley is hilarious in his role. He plays a slimy criminal that makes Nicholas run errands for him. He's basically playing a character very similar to his role in Iron Man 3 as the Mandarin.
I've always seen Ben Kingsley as a serious actor but when I watched Ironman 3 that was so surprising in a good way to see that he could really ham it up.
He really hams it up in Collide. The movie overall was very average, the action was good, the romance bare, and the story plot pretty basic. I would consider this movie a pretty generic action flick.
This sounds like one of those rainy Sunday afternoon movies to throw on. I think I'll save it for that occasion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not a fan of all of Tom Cruise's works but I sure did like Top Gun.
I didn't think that I would like it, but I did.
It's got the sweet music, sweet cinematography, sweet story.
And the twist!
I knew that something bad would need to happen to shake up the story but I wasn't expecting the death.
And how much it shook up Maverick - that brought it home to me.
I liked Charlie, too.
Maverick was so hot to prove himself to her but she took her own time, and I liked that.
And managed to break through his thick headedness and teach him a lesson!
Which took a lot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there
Hi
Want do you want to talk about?
What about movies?
Sure i love movies
Whats your favorite kind?
I love action movies
Me too, there so good
Exactly i like them better fast paced
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
The most recent Indiana Jones movie was just awful.
i remember seeing it at the theater when it came out and wondering what they were thinking.
It was just a bad plot.  Aliens?  Come on now.
It didn't help that they made it so unrealistic.
Which part are you referring to?
Well, take your pick, but I mean the nuke scene.
Oh, the one where he hid in the fridge?
Yep, that's the one.  Completely ridiculous.
To me, that pretty much signaled the end of the Indiana Jones ever being in danger.
Agreed.  Kind of takes the mystery out of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Do you like action movies?
Nowadays not so much, I like 80's and 90's the most.
I know what you mean.
The action movies now have almost too much action.
Yeah not much plot.
exactly.
What's an example of a newer one you don't like.
Any of the Transformer movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good movie about the apocalypse?
I suggest you check out Terminator 2.
I heard that movie was scary.
It is scary because it could happen. You should face your fears though.
I will. What happens in this movie?
A robot goes back in time to try to destroy a man who will save humanity in the future.
That makes my brain hurt! I already have enough trouble keeping up with today.
It isn't that bad. There is good story progression.
Will it require more than one watches?
It might. You will catch more if you watch it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You have see this movie called Suburban Commando.
I've never heard of it. What's it about?
Oh it's great. Basically it is Hulk Hogan as an alien assassin being chased by other alien assassins who are also professional wrestlers.
This is starting to sound like a terrible movie.
It is! But it is just so terrible that it happened to be great. They obviously blew their budget on the Hulkster.
Okay, so you are saying it's kind of like Sharknado, in that it's so bad that it's kind of good?
Yeah, I mean just imagine Hulk Hogan in a cheap alien uniform escaping the Undertaker's lasers through a random suburban town.
Oh god, I don't know if I want to see this movie.
It is so worth it though. The entire movie is cheap, the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money.
That just sounds despicable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Captain America:Civil War?
Yes, I did!  I couldn't believe that the Captain and Iron Man fought each other!
Personally, I was on Team Iron Man. How about you?
Oh, definitely!  Captain America got a little evil there at the end.
Didn't he let his friend almost rip Tony's heart thing out?
I think so and then took his friend's side of Tony's.  That was just way wrong.
I used to like Captain America but now I am not so sure.
Me either.  I hope they make another movie where Iron Man kicks his butt!
I totally agree with that!  Iron Man needs to wipe the floor with him and teach him a serious lesson about right and wrong!
And a lesson about loyalty and friendship!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch kissing by sharon sala
Yeah man she's good

On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Has anyone seen the new Transformers movie yet?
No I didn't, who was playing this weekend?
Well Crrossroads and also Regal is playing it.
What is the story line on this one?
Humans are at war with the Transformers, and Optimus Prime is gone. The key to saving the future lies buried in the secrets of the past and the hidden history of Transformers on Earth
I hope Mark Wahlburg is playing in this one, he was great in the last movie.
Yes, he is coming back, and Josh Duhamel plays beside him in this with Anthony Hopkins too!
I am so going to see that on the big screen!
Yes, I think its the only real way to see an action movie like this.
To do it justice, yes it is!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good action movie lately?
Yes I have actually, I just saw Logan and thought it was pretty good.
Really? I wanted to catch that one but couldnt Im planning to buy the DVD version.
You should, its a good movie althought I thought it was going to be better.
Oh I see, well dont spoil it for me.
Ok I won´t, and tell me, have you seen any good action movies lately?
Yes, I recently watched Wonder Woman and thought it was pretty good as well.
I liked that movie also, I think its the best DC movie so far.
Yeah it probably, im exited to watch the upcoming Justice League movie.
I know, I really want to watch it as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man did you see that movie that jackie chan was in
Which one
The action one
Well he has been in alot of them
Oh i thought he was a comedy actor
No he mainly did action for awhile
Well that is news to me
It should not be surprising to be honest
Why though
Because he is pretty cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Do you watch action movies?
Yeah definitely.
Do you have a favorite one?
I like Bad Boys.
With Will Smith?
Yeah that's the one.
You know I've never seen that one.
Oh man, you should definitely see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy American Sniper?
Yes, that is one of my favorite action movies.
It had a lot of good drama, but the action scenes were very realistic.
I agree and the acting was top notch.
Clint Eastwood is a serious director.
He has done alot of good work for many years.
I was surprised at how big Bradley Cooper got for that role.
He must have trained a few hours a day to get in that kind of shape.
He is a really good actor.
Yeah, Clint knows how to cast a film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to go see Kong: Skull Island?
No I haven't , it looks great.
Yes, it came out in March of this year.  I am renting it this weekend.
What is the story about?
Scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean.  They find an uncharted island, which turns out dangerous.
The animation and cinematography look fantastic, I wanted to see it on the big screen.
Yes that really makes these kinds of movies come alive.
Was it action packed?
Yes, once they found King  Kong and the other creatures, it was non stop.
I wil try to rent it this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like any of Patrick Swayzes action films?
Like Ghost?
No, that is a romance. I mean like Point Break.
With Keanu Reeves?
That one.
I think it was a cool like surfer action one.
I liked that the bad guys were all sporty.
They were not that bad of bad guys too.
The people who were supposed to be bad had me sort of rooting for them.
I think that was just good acting on their parts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard The Mummy was filled with action scenes.
Oh yeah the special effects were great.
How did Tom Cruise do?
Hes always good in these types of movies.
I am surprised he would do this kind of film
Why he does action films all the time.
Yeah but a remake that wasnt bad?
You always want to put your spin on things.
I think he made the role his.
It did terrible at the box office.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Die Hard is one of my all time favorite movies.
It was Bruce Willis' best role.
I just think the scenes with the buildings blowing up were great.
Had awesome acting in it for sure.
That too, and the plot twists.
I dont think there were that many of them.
Enough to make you hooked, I dont know why they did sequels though.
Sometimes you want to capture lightning in a bottle.
At the expense of the viewer?
Hardcore fans go to any action movie regardless of a thinning plot line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good action movie to watch?
We could watch Law Abiding Citizen.
Oh, I haven't seen that for a long time. Gerard Butler was fantastic in that!
He was. I definitely didn't expect it to be so dark.
Me either. Especially after seeing him play the good guy so much.
I know what you mean. He was a really good guy in Gamer.
Exactly. He went from misunderstood hero to crazy vigilante like it was nothing.
I was completely on the edge of my seat during Gamer.
Me too. Also, his role in 300, just amazing.
I know! He's such a great actor, he can really do anything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Dark Tower is coming out soon.
That is based upon the Steven King novel right?
Yes, I read it when I was a kid.
Fans have been waiting a long time for this movie adaptation.
It should be good as Idris Elba plays the main character.
I remember him from The Wire.
He is actually a British actor but he plays those American roles very well.
When is the movie due to release?
August 4th of this year.
I'll set the date to go to the theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Departed?
I don't think so, who is in it?
Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Jack Nicholson.
No, I don't think so.  Is it any good?
It's a great action movie.  If you like those types of movies, definitely check it out.
What's it about?
Well, I don't want to spoil the plot but it's a complicated story of two men undercover, one in the police and the other in the mob.
Oh, sounds interesting.
Yeah, it's a complicated story but it does it just right and keeps you very entertained.  I highly recommend it.
I'll check it out, thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what makes an action movie an action movie?
For one thing, it needs a chase scene. A  car chase, preferably with cars turned over and stunt men laying down motorcycles.
Yeah, like in Bullit. That was so cool. You could see McQueen actually driving that thing, all through it.
Bullit didn't invent the chase, but it perfected it.
No doubt. Then there's the chase in The French Connection. That was a new action movie high, too.
Yeah, I remember. All along under the tracks. Gene Hackman was so great.
Yeah, and there's a car crash in it, you remember?
Yeah, of course I do. Blam, crumples him.
Well, that was real. Some guy was on his way to work, and didn't know they were filming. They paid him, and fixed his car.
No kidding. No wonder it looked real.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What you think of Jurassic World
LOVED IT, what about Fast Five?
Dude Vin Desiel was a beast in it!
I know everything was just exploding in that movie
What you think about Avengers: Infinity Wars?
Super stoaked about it
ME TOO
I can't wait for Thor: Ragnarok
ME TOO MAN it's gonna be great
So many good movies coming out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie?
My favorite action movie would probably be The Terminator.
What is it about The Terminator that you like so much?
I don't think it's just one element, but instead the combination of actors and the premise of artificial intelligence.
Interesting.  Are there any other action movies you feel strongly positive about?
Sure, there are many, but to name one specifically, I think The Matrix is a very good movie.
What is it about The Matrix that you enjoyed?
I really liked the premise of artificial intelligence.  But, I also liked how the hero grew confident, made sacrifices, and ultimately succeeded.
Did you enjoy the follow up movies to The Matrix trilogy?
Yes, I enjoyed those as well.  However, the original was significantly better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Die Hard movie?
That's some tough competition.  They are all good.
For me, I'll say the second one.
The one in the airport?
Yep.  A lot more was on the line since they could crash planes.
That's a fair argument.  The first will always be the best though.
That's true with most movies.
Best villain by far though with Hans.
No argument there.  That was a classic.
RIP Alan Rickman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved that movie, Die Hard.
The Bruce Willis flick from the 80's.
The first one was the best one but I didn't enjoy the sequels nearly as much.
The first one was very original and had a great cast.
Who played the villian in that one? I can't remember.
It was Alan Rickman.
That's right. He is a great actor.
I agree.
I wonder if there really is a Nakatomi building in LA?
I don't think so, but if there is, it sure took a beating from the filming of all those action scenes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
What is your most favorite action movie?
Of all time?
Yep.
I really like mad max fury road.
Man that is a good choice.
I loved that movie, it's so great.
The action and the story it's all fantastic.
I couldn't agree more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was better, John Wick or John Wick 2?
That's a tough decision.
I would go with the second just because of the higher body count.
True, but the first had a better story.
I would agree with you there since they killed his dog.
The second had the better action pieces though.
It's a tough call either way; you really can't go wrong.
I'll be really looking forward to the third one coming out?
They're making another one?  Awesome!
Yep, another couple years, but will be special!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Lethal Weapon Movies.
Yes, I have seen them all at least twice.
Which one is the best?
That is hard to say. I like the first one because it really sets up the characters.
Is Joe Pesci in that one?
No, he was introduced in Lethal Weapon 2. He was a witness that had to be protected.
Is he in any others?
He is in all of them after the second one. He provides a lot of humor.
I think I will check them out.
Great. Just start with the first one and watch them all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Jurassic Park sequels?
Lost World was okay. What did you think of the third?
It's underrated. It's pretty entertaining, I think.
I just don't like that Tea Leoni is in it; I don't like her.
Me neither.
Jurassic World was a lot of fun to watch but doesn't stand up over time.
Really?
Yeah, I own it, and watched it twice, but not in over a year.
Why?
Too unbelievable, bad parenting like crazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId you watch the movie "Unbreakable"?
Yes, that is the one with Bruce Willis as the Security Guard.
Yes, he did a good job. I was expecting something like he usually does, but this one had a slow pace.
I really did not expect him to turn into a super hero, it really picked up on all the action and suspense, great ending
Did you catch the twist at the ending?
Kinda, can you fill me in a bit?
Well starts out Bruce is a security guard with one kid, and he and his wife are having issues. He is on a train going to NYC, for an interview.
That is when the train wrecks and he is the only one, left alive.
Yes, and the reason he was left alive was that he had the powers of a superhero, but he had no idea.
Then he runs into the man that has the broken bone disease. Who in turns in the end orchestrated the entire thing. Bruce was the good guy and the other guy was MR. Glass.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?
No I haven't, is it any good?
Yes, it is amazing! It has Vin Disel in it, and I am a big fan.
I was never a big fan of his movies.
How could you say that? The Pacifier was amazing!
To each his own I suppose.
I can agree. Do you like anyone from the Fast and Furious franchise?
I like Dwayne Johnson, is he in those movies.
Yes I believe so.
I may need to watch the series then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was Nicholas Cage's best movie?
He's been in some pretty good ones and some bad ones.
I would probably say The Rock.
Nah.  Face-Off.
That movie was too ridiculous.  The premise alone was dumb.
And The Rock was more believable?  He took down a team of soldiers.
I'm not saying it wasn't far-fetched, but at least it was in the realm of plausible.
Face transplants can happen.  I read an article about it.
There's a difference between some medical journals and what happens in the movies.
You're just jealous because I'm the good looking one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Bruce Willis movie is Die Hard.
Man, I loved that movie when I was a kid.
Oh, yeah, I thought he was so tough.  I wanted to be like him.
I don't blame you.  He set a standard.
Alan Rickman was a formidable villain, too.
Yes, I thought they worked well together onscreen.
There were lots of cool sequences in that film.
There sure were.  I think a lot of films copied its style.
I thought it was cool that it was set during Christmas, too.
Me, too.  I watch it every Christmas!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they'll make another Indiana Jones.
After that last flop?!
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?
Yeah. That was terrible.
I'd tend to agree.
Anyhow, Hon Solo is dead.
Shut up! That's Star Wars.
I know. Ha!
Harrison Ford is getting a little long in the tooth anyway.
Yeah, time to retire the bull whip.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't believe Terminator 2 came out 25 years ago.
It's crazy, isn't it?  Still one of the better action movies I've ever seen.
The whole Terminator series was awesome, but T2 brought it to a whole another level.
Arnold was a complete boss in that movie.
He was overwhelmed.  The T1000 was the superior machine.
Yeah, but the T800 is no slouch.  Plus he looks like Arnold.
The rest of the series got pretty bad though.
Yeah, once James Cameron left the director's chair, it ran off the rails.
Think he'll ever get back in it?
I doubt it.  Doesn't change the fact they were great movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Favorite action movie?
Does Terminator count?
Well, it's sci-fi, but it's still action.
Terminator it is! Back befor the Gubenator.
Ha! He was a much better actor that politician.
You can say that again.
Why would you say it's your favorite?
It just hits all the action essentials.
In spades.
In fact, I kinda wanna watch it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite kind of action movies
Well that is a hard pick
I mean it should be simple
Nah it is not
Well i love ones like kung fu films
Those are pretty neat
You like them?
Yeah they are fun
I like the old ones the best
some new ones are good too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best action movie you have seen in the 10 years.
That would have to be Crank. That movie was constant action.
I would have to agree with you. It was non-stop from the beginning to the end.
There were quite a bit of memorable scenes in that movie.
Jason Stathum has got to be one of the best action movie stars today.
He has been in a lot of good ones. I wouldn't expect to see him in a romantic comedy anytime soon.
Are there any other action movies that stick out to you.
Definitely, I really like the Die Hard movies.
Some people consider the original Die Hard to be a Christmas movie. That is funny.
I don't know about it being a Christmas movie, but it is one of the all-time best action movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Deadpool and really loved it.
I did not get to see it yet but I have heard great things about it.
There is tons of action and Marvel Comics movies are always the way to go.
Ryan Reynolds is a wonderful actor I heard he did a great job.
Oh my, he really did! You get to fall in love with the soft side of Deadpool.
I heard that Wade gets cancer in the movie, is that true.
It is true! I don't want to spoil too much but he has a soft side and it's really sweet that he leaves for Vanessa's sake.
Does Wade and Vanessa get married at the end?
Well, she is really upset that he left her, but she's happy to have him back at the end.
I really need to watch this movie, I think I am going to rent it tonight and indulge myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Lethal Weapon again on tv last night.
Wow, directed by the Superman guy?
Yes, Richard Donner.
Who is the bad guy?
Gary Busey.
What year was that released?
1987.
I forget, what happens in the end?
Mel Gibson and Danny Glover kill Gary Busey.
Right, and Gibson and Glover become best buddies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best action film in the last five years?
That is a hard one. Maybe something like, Edge of Tommorow.
With the aliens and the big guns, very suspenseful and lots of action.
I liked the way the plot played with time too.
Oh yes, they died so many times it was crazy.
I like that one and Snowpiercer.
I have never seen that one.
It has Chris Evans in it, it is not a really popular one.
Is it a super hero one?
No, he is on a train going no where and there is just a lot of action. He ends up dying in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite action movie that is based on a television show?
That would be The Fugitive.
Is that the Harrisson Ford film from the 90s?
Yep, that's the one.
That is a great film and I especially enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's character.
I agree, he was fantastic.
Did you know that he improvised the line, "I don't care!"?
I think I had heard that before. It's a great line.
Let's not forget about Harrisson Ford either. He was excellent as well.
I think he was good, but not great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Die Hard?
Are you kidding me, of course!
Do you like one particular one versus another?
Definitely the first one.
Yeah, that was pretty good. No shoes.
Yes, no shoes and a lot of "shoot the glass."
Some great lines in that one as well
Yes indeed. Now I have a machine gun ho ho ho.
Bruce Willis was the man back in the day
Well, except for Moonlight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Bloon n Bones.
Oh I've seen that, with Michael Jai White.
Yea, that was crazy. That prison scene at the beginning was great.
Yea, I really liked they put kimbo slice in it.
The fight scene where he keeps doubling the best was cool too.
Oh, yea, that was awesome how he kicked all three of those guys at once.
Yea, and when the guy put the money in his pants and Michael Jai ripped the money right out, that was really awesome.
Yea it was, I couldn't believe he did that!
I really hope they come out with a second one.
Me too, that movie was really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Russel Crow movie.
Gotta go with Gladiator.
What an awesome flick!
Who was the emperor?
The guy who played Dumbledore?
No his son.
Oh, Pheonix!
Yeah, Joaquin Phoenix.
Now that boy can act.
Yeah, someone should give him an Oscar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Action seems to be one of the strongest genres going. I mean, John Wick alone
That franchise will run out of gas eventually, but yeah, good stuff
The only dark spot is the Fast & Furious franchise. That has been a drag for several movies now
Totally. I'm liking these more under the radar films anyway, like The Guest
Such a good movie. The bigger films are a bit stale, as usual
Especially when Tom Cruise is wasting time with the likes of The Mummy
That was a crap fest from the beginning. It was easy to sense that it was going to fail
I do think the future as always is through gritty, small budget films
The guy who'll next break out is the one that did Blue Ruin and The Green Room.
He's gonna be big, agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the latest Transformers movie, The Last Knight?
Not really, Michael Bay really lost me after the second one, Revenge of the Fallen.
Revenge of the Fallen was so bad. The action sequences were good in it and I didn't mind Shia Labeouf's constant screaming or Megan Fox's sex appeal but the heavy inclusion of his parents was too much.
I agree, the stuff with his parents and the brownies, as well as all the unnecessary scenes with the dogs were off putting. The story line itself was a mess.
I can see why you gave up on the Transformers franchise. Michael Bay is going to give you action but nobody has ever said he knew how to work together a good concept to present through all those explosions and crashes.
That's exactly the problem with the Transformers films. I want to watch the films for Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron, not for the parents or Shia's love life problems.
I can't argue about that although I think the 3rd Transformers film, Dark of the Moon was pretty decent. Definitely a good bounce back from Revenge of the Fallen.
I haven't watched it but it has Rosie Huntington and Patrick Duffy right?
Yeah Rosie replaced Megan Fox as Sam, or Shia's love interest. John Malkovich is also in the movie, but he plays more of a comic relief role.
I love John Malkovich especially in Being John Malkovich, and I think he's such a respectable actor that I almost watched Dark of the Moon for him but I wasn't sold because Michael Bay was directing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Bond movie?
Old or new?  There's been so many.
I would just say ones that have been made recently, like the last 15 years or so.
So out of the Daniel Craig movies?  Skyfall.
See, I always thought that was a bit overrated.  I prefer Casino Royale.
Well, that was the first one with him I think.  They worked the kinks out in that movie.
I actually thought the plot was better than Skyfall.
We'll have to agree to disagree on that one.
One thing's for sure: Quantam of Solace was garbage.
Oh yeah.  Not a good film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Sleepless Night.
French movie, I believe.
Yes, directed by Frederic Jardin.
What's it about?
A French detective's son is kidnapped for cocaine.
Who stars in the movie?
Tomer Sisley. Adel Bencherif
Tomer Sisley is hot!
Yes, he was in Angelique.
Another cool flick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to see Wonder Woman yet?
Certainly did.  I was surprised by it.
How so?
It was much better than I anticipated.  I especially liked the war scene where she ran through the middle.
Yeah, that was a very emotional scene and very well-directed.
Gal Gadot played the character perfectly throughout.
It helps that she's pretty easy on the eyes.
That's an understatement.  She's beautiful.
I will probably end up seeing it again next week.  Want to go?
Sure.  Let's plan a time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hardcore Henry was such an invigorating action movie!
Was that the movie that was shot first person point of view with stuntmen and GoPro cameras?
That's the film. It stars Sharlto Copley and Haley Bennett. Basically we get to be in the shoes of the main character Henry as he's frantically running, jumping, and fighting his way to figure out who he is.
I love Sharlto Copley especially since his performance in District 9, and Haley Bennett was fantastic in The Girl On The Train.
Sharlto's character plays the helper for the main character as he's always giving directions and helpful advice. Haley plays his wife and the doctor that puts him together.
I haven't seen the movie yet but is the main character suppose to be a cyborg of some sort?
Yes, Henry is basically a former soldier that now has been implanted with cybernetic parts for enhanced battle and warfare. It's such a rush of a movie, the action, the music, the pace is non stop.
I've been meaning to catch it but I can't find it anywhere. I'm curious to see how they pull off the stunts as well as watching the action sequences. I hope I don't get motion sickness.
To be honest, I was a bit nauseous at the start when the action was so fast paced but as it when on I got more used to it. They pace the movie well but they do give you short breaks to catch your breath.
That all sounds good. I'll have to look harder to find Hardcore Henry to finally watch to see what I've been missing out on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Pulp Fiction for the first time today.
Wow, that is a real classic cult action film.
It was nothing like what I expected.
John Travolta is brilliant in that movie.
He was like this cool contract killer, him and the other guy?
Samuel L. Jackson?
Yes! When he recited the Bible verse, albeit a little wrongly, it was so intense.
Then ended up shooting the guy any way.
Yes! I liked how all the stories bled into one another.
Yes, but some characters never even met. Like Bruce Willis and Travolta, their characters never meet,
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId you see any Charles Bronson Movies?
Sure, all the "Death Wish" series.  Each time his wife, girlfriend or daughter was murdered and he wreaked venvence on the killers in the end.
He started out as a pacifist in the first one and his wife and daughter were killed or maimed horribly by street punks.
The first time he struck back he used two rolls of quarters in a sock as a weapon to run off a would be mugger.
That was just practice as he was looking for the creeps that had destroyed his family.
He took out quite a few bad guys along the way.
Sure, there was a couple being mugged in a parking garage and he showed up to help, killing the bad guys.
The civilians suddenly could not remember what he looked like when the cops tried to find out who he was.
In the end the cops found out who he was but he had taken out so many bad guys that the let him go by making him leave town for good.
That put him in another city to do the same thing again a few years later.  It was risky to be his wife or girlfriend, most of them were murdered by creeps!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which new action movie do you really like?
I really like Kong: Skull Island.
Why do you like this one?
The action and screenplay was amazing in this film.
Why do you say that?
I like how the fighting and action was non-stop.
I really liked the War of the Planet Apes.
Yes, this movie was great as well.
I really liked how the humans and monkeys just clashed over and over again.
Yes, that makes for an epic show down in the next movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I caught the movie The Great Wall the other day, have you seen it yet?
The one with Matt Damon in ancient China times right?
Yeah that's the one, it was really entertaining! Matt Damon is such a good actor.
I love Matt Damon in the Jason Bourne Series and I was hoping this would be just as fun and it was.
I think Matt Damon brings such a charisma on to the screen. In The Great Wall he plays a thief that ends up helping this Dynasty protect their walls from these demon monsters.
Wow, I didn't realize that film had monster elements! I haven't watched it yet but this sounds like my type of movie.
He battles these demon monsters that are threatening to take over the world. They repopulate really fast and are just terrifying.
It sounds like a movie Matt Damon would be pretty good in! As long as it's action and he get's to kick butt I think the movie will be enjoyable.
Oh he certainly does kick a lot of demon monster butt. I think you'll enjoy it the cinematography is really good and the action is tons of fun.
I'll look for The Great Wall when it comes out to add to my Matt Damon movies collection.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Mad Max Fury road.
How was it?
Well, it was non stop action from beginning to end.
Sounds like a good movie.
Yes it was.  Then I wanted to watch the original so i did.  Mel Gibson looked really young.
He was in the first ones.
The same director who directed road warrior directed Fury Road.
Were the styles similar?
Oh yes, and there were lots of easter eggs
I will look for them when I watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Blade III?
There was no Blade III.
You're a huge Blade fan, you don't know they made a third one?
Exactly. I'm a huge Blade fan; I don't acknowledge it exists.
You didn't like it at all?
No. It was a mess of a plot. Dracula wasn't really intimidating even though they made him out to be.
I thought the action scenes were cool.
Maybe, but they weren't, like, impressive.
You didn't think Jessica Biel's bow and arrow was cool?
...It was a little cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Harrison Ford movie.
The Fugitive, for sure.
Oh, yeah. With Tommy Lee.
That guy is so good.
They made a sequel, you know.
Nuh uh!
Yeah, US Marshals.
Huh. Was Ford in that one.
No, but the brought back Jones.
I'm gonna have to see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Fan of action movies?
Yeah love action movies.
Same here.
Cool.
What is your favorite one of all time.
Tough question.
Take your time.
I would have to say Die Hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Roy Scheider?
Wow, I haven't thought of him in years.
Well I saw a great action movie that he did back in the 70's.
What was it?
It was called Sorcerer.
What was the plot?
Scheider had to run a truckload of nitroglycerine through a South American jungle.
That sounds tense.
It was very tense and the cinematography was great.
I am going to see if I can rent that one tonight from iTunes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Kurt Russel?
Yes I am. He is great.
Have you ever seen Big Trouble in Little China?
No I haven't. What is it about?
It is a supernatural action movie where Kurt Russel saves the world.
That sounds like my type of movie.
I think you would love it. Kurt uses his martial arts skills to fight wizards.
Wow. So he beats people even though they have magic?
Yes he does. That is what Kurt Russel does.
You are making me want to go on an 80's movie binge.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember  "Last Action Hero?"
Who could forget that movie?! It was Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role ever as far as I'm concerned.
I have to disagree with you there, I think his best role ever was "Terminator 2: Judgement Day."
That was a really good one, not as good as "Last Action Hero," but it was really good.
I think that if they'd had more time to work on it, it would have been a lot better.
I do agree with you on that point. The studio did them dirty.
I also think that because of that is why Arnold slowed down his acting career.
That makes sense. I'd be pretty discouraged if I were him.
At least he came back for "The Expendables." What a fantastic movie.
Yeah, I love that movie. Totally action packed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite action movie?
Definitely Gone In 60 Seconds.
Ohhh that is a great movie!
I love all of the cool cars and how they're always racing.
I thought that was pretty good too.  I liked the stunts they did while driving.
I know.  It was incredible!  I can't believe what those cars are capable of!
How about that Shelby?
I know.  That car was hot!  I would have loved to have been the actor that got to drive that car!
I thought Vin Diesel did a great job in that movie.
I agree.  So did Angelina Jolie and Nicholas Cage!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Independence Day film did you like more? The orginial one released in 1996 or Independence Day: Resurgence, the one released in 2016?
I liked them both a lot! The newest one is a sequel to the orginial, so the story line pretty much picked up where the first one left off.
You're correct but I can't help but feel more of an attachment to the first one.
Well I think the orginal film had much better acting and didn't have as much CGI as the second one but I'm a sucker for these types of films.
Do you remember President Whitmore's motivating speech in the first movie?
Which the speech? The speech at the air base before the final assualt on the alien mothership?
Yup that's the one! Bill Pullman's speech is actually considered one of the best actor monologues of all time.
Ha! In my acting class last semester I actually had to perform a monologue and chose this exact monologue for my presentation.
How does the monologue start?
"Good morning. In less than an hour, aircraft from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest aerial battle in this history of mankind." Just writing it gives me chills! Imagine what would be going through your mind, knowing the fate of mankind rest on your shoulders. Bill Pullman is a great actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you enjoy action movies?
Yeah I do.
What do you like most about them?
I like the fast pace of them and how exciting they are.
They are great for that.
Indeed.
I enjoy the plot and the explosions.
Interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Arnold Schwazernager, fan?
Absolutely, how about you?
Definitely, what's your favorite Arnold movie?
Terminator 2
Oh right, that was pretty good. A lot of cool effects.
how about you?
I liked Predator
Get to the chopper!!!
Yes, that was an iconic line
Yeah, pretty funny quote
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the movie Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2. Have you seen that movie?
Yes I just watched that movie the other day. I thought it was a great movie. How did you like it?
I thought it was a really great movie as well. I love the mixture of both action and humor.
Who was your favorite character in the movie?
I really like the character Yondu Udonta. Who is your favorite character?
I really love the main character star-lord. The character is so funny and I enjoy watching the actor play him.
Who is the actor that plays star-lord? I remember him on the movie Passengers but can't recall his name.
The actor who plays star-lord is Chris Pratt ofcourse. I hope they come out with a third Guardians of the Galaxy soon.
I hope they do as well. Next week I am going to see the new Wonder Woman movie. Would you like to go with me?
Yes I would love to see the new Wonder Woman movie with you. I love that actress Gal Gadot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of Steven Seagal's movies.
Yes, I have seen all his older ones.
Why not the new ones.
His new ones are pretty low budget B movie face, His 80s and 90s stuff is the best.
Which ones are good.
Under Siege was one of his best. He is pretty much the only guy free on an Aircraft Carrier and he has to save everyone else.
That sounds cool. Wasn't there a sequel.
Yes, It was set on a train. It was pretty good too. Eric Bogosian was great as the villain.
I will check those out. Any others you would recommend?
Hard to Kill was good, so was Out for Justice. They have lots of action!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Indiana Jones series?
I love them. My favorite of the series has to be Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Oh that's a great one. I prefer The Temple of Doom.
That one had so many classic scenes. Harrison Ford was great in those.
He really was. And Sean Connery playing his father was excellent.
That was The Last Crusade right?
Yes, that was entertaining all the way through. I didn't care for The Crystal Skull though.
Yes Shia LeBeouf is not one of my favorite actors.
I liked him in Transformers though. The action was great.
To me there was just a little too much action in those, even for an action movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Suicide Squad?
On a scale of 1 - 10?  Maybe a 5.
That seems a bit low.
A few reasons for that.  For one, it definitely didn't focus on the Joker enough.
Okay.
And two, it was way too easy to kill the end guy.
It did take the fire gangster to do it though.
That's my point.  They should have just sent him in alone.
But then you wouldn't have a squad at all, just a guy.
I'm just saying.  Kind of made the ending weird in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the ultimate action film?
I would go with Die hard.
That is a great action film. So Iconic.
Yes and one of the only action movies I also consider a christmas movie.
Ha that is true. Nothing says christmas like die hard.
Well it does take place at a christmas office party. I think alan rickman would agree.
Hans gruber what a great character. Rickman did that role so well.
I think of them as two in one almost. Though rickman was a superb actor in other roles, hans was my favorite performance of his.
I enjoy rickman in all his roles from hans to snape to love actually. But Hans is such an iconic bad guy and probably my favorite role for him.
Ya I did not care to see hans /rickman in the love actually role at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite type of movie?
I am a really big fan of action movies.
Oh ya me too. Have you seen the Rush Hour Series?
Ya it is one of my favorites. Which one is your favorite?
I am a huge fan of the 2nd one.
Ya I like that one too. Jackie Chan is one of my favorites.
Ya me too. I think him and Chris Tucker work really well together.
Ya. I like how they combine action with comedy.
Ya it gives you the best of both worlds.
Ya, they are the best duo in my opinion in regards to action movies. The bloopers at the end are awesome too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of your favorite action films?
I really like Tom Cruise action movies actually.
Yeah, he's done quite a few.  I loved Days of Thunder
That's a good one, I like a lot of his more recent films too.
I haven't seen too many of his newer films, I heard the Mission Impossible Films are pretty good.
They are.  I also like the Jack Reacher films.
I've never seen those either.  Do you like Matt Damon?
Yes, I'm a huge fan of the Jason Bourne series.
Me too, did you watch the latest one?
Yes, it was awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action movies?
I do! I love going to the theatre to see them.
What kind of action movies do you enjoy?
I really love action movies with strong female leads, what about you?
I'm really into dystopian action movies, a lot of them start out as books and are translated onto screen really well.
I love dystopian everything. Dystopian action films with strong female leads have really blown up in the last few years.
Thats so true. The entire action genre has really split into so many different categories, its no longer just blowing stuff up.
Yeah, I think it's because you can only blow so much stuff up before it gets boring for the viewers.
There's definitely some classics that are mostly just blowing things up that I still enjoy though.
I agree, you can't beat a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Raid: Redemption is one of the best action movies ever.
I saw it, it felt like the movie barely slowed down.
The first half is so depressing, with all the heroes run through a meat grinder.
And then when it did slow down after that, with the guy hiding in the wall and the machete cutting him, the tension was so unbelievably high.
Oh god and then after that it just keeps on being this relentless martial arts movie.
It just didn't stop.
That last fight with Mad Dog was wild.
I know; I felt like the actors were just as exhausted as the characters.
I can't believe the skill and stamina they had. That was a nonstop movie.
I wish more action movies were like that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider Iron Man an action movie?
Yes I would say its a super hero action movie
OK some people would not consider it that so I was just checking.
I think the plot is not one of an action movie but it develops into one.
Do you think the comics are action comics?
No I feel like Hollywood brings that element.
I liked how Robert Downey Jr Played Tony Stark in the film.
He did an excellent job with him.
His enemy was right on too.
I cant remember his name but it was an epic battle at the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what movie I love? Django Unchained.
Dear God. I loved that movie, too.
A lot of people say it was slow, but I completely disagree. The dialogue was superb.
Exactly. That why I watch Tarantino films. The dialogue.
He is really a master. Like with Pulp Fiction when Samuel L. Jackson is in the house with those small time drug dealers.
"Mmhmm! This IS a tasty burger!"
I will never forget that so long as I live!
That scene is full of amazing dialogue.
How about, "I want you to go in that bag, and find my wallet." And the guy goes, "Which one is it?"
Oh, yes! And he says, "It's the one that says 'Bad Mother' beep!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Has anyone seen the new Transformers movie yet?
It just came out the 20th of June, so I plan on seeing it Friday!
DO you know who is playing in it?
Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Hopkins, Laura Haddock, Josh Duhamel are some of the names in this summer movie.
I noticed that this movie has grossed already $260 million dollars already and its not even toward the first weekend yet!
Wow. These guys make so much money it's nuts!
Who was the director of it?
Michael Bay directed this one, he does an amazing job with directing.
I enjoy his movies as well.
Maybe we can go see it together?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me what kind of action movies you like?
Oh, I think Predator is one of my favorites.
Haha, yes! With Arnold fighting the predator at the end.
Yup and the classic phrases like "get to da choppa!"
But yeah, the Predator is a classic villain.
With his night vision and voice mimicking powers.
Don't forget about the optic camouflage.
Wasn't Jesse Ventura in that movie?
Yes! He plays one of the big soldiers guys.
What a great action movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the Expendables movies was your favorite?
Oh man, I really like them. I love that throwback style.
I'm partial to the second.
Me too, it had so many giddy catchphrase moments.
What about the third?
It seemed a bit unnecessary.
Wait, which was the one with Stone Cold Steve Austin?
That's the original.
Ahh, thanks, it's been a while.
Not sure why they had him as being the big bodyguard. All things considered, he's not THAT big.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.
Who is in it other than Tom Cruise?
Cobie Smulders is the woman.
Anyone else?
Danika Yarosh plays a teenager.  She's pretty good.
Who directed?
Edward Zwick.
Did he work with Cruise before?
Yes, The Last Samurai.
Neat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Kong Skull Island last night with my folks.
That's the King Kong remake starring Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson right?
That's the one, John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson also star in it.
I heard John C. Reily is also in there.
He is in there he makes a surprise appearance, but his character was so funny.
Did you like the movie or was it just like the past remakes?
I actually enjoyed it a great deal. It was very action packed, suspenseful, and I thought they did a great job avoiding some typical action movie cliches.
How was Kong? Were they just trying to battle him the whole movie?
Kong was enormous! They actually start out with you thinking Kong was the villain but you soon realize he's actually the hero.
Sounds amazing! I'll have to try to catch it soon too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
James Bond, yes or no?
Hmm...I'd say maybe
I liked the original ones, not so much the new ones
Really?! I prefer the new ones with Daniel Craig
I don't know, kind of too serious for me. I liked Roger Moore.
Roger Moore! Those were way too corny
Well I liked the tongue in check humor
But they were so unbelievable!
Um, aren't all James Bond movies unbelievable
Good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite action movie?
I'd have to say Heat
Yea, Robert De Niro was so good
It had the perfect blend of action and character development
It had such good actors and the directors really took it to the next level
It was interesting to see all the movies that copied it.
I think The Town was nearly a direct copy of Heat.
Yea, but they did give homage to it with some scenes of it playing on Ben Afflecks characters tv.
It's hard to get such quality action films
There are a few good ones which I will always rewatch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best action movie ever made?
Die hard without a doubt.
Why die hard? I mean I enjoy it, but best of all time?
John McClane is such a great action character and Bruce Willis is great in the role.
I'll give you that, but better than some of Jackie Chan's early stuff? Better than The Terminator?
It's absolutely better than both, don't get me wrong I love Arnold's classic Terminator role as much as the next guy.
I would take any of The Terminator films over any of The Die Hard Films.
Even the one that didn't include Arnold Schwarzenegger in the cast at all?
Absolutely, Die Hard just never really did it for me in a major way.
You're missing out, John McClane would totally terminate the Terminator
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite martial arts action flick?
Probably any of the Ip Man trilogy.
Who stars in that?
Donnie Yen from Hong Kong. He's incredible and super creative.
Nice, I'll check it out.
Yours?
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
That choice means you've only seen one.
How do you know?
It's the only mass-market movie to hit American theaters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate action movies with drama
But the drama is usually plot
and plot is the worst part of an action movie
You speak blasphemy
Nah i speak the truth
How can you enjoy stuff being mindless
Because it is fun
but fun can be boring
No it cannot
Why not
XXXXXXXXXXX
I enjoy watching men in black
Me too
Those movies are awesome
And will smith is amazing
Yes he does a good job as an agent
I also like tommy lee jones
They are an unlikely pair
They sre but the work great together
I love the story line of the movie
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay. Top action move by Arnold Schrwarzenegger?
That's easy. Commando.
All the movies he's done, and you go to Commando?
It's a good story and It's got Alyssa Milano in it.
Whatever. Okay, greatest Bruce Willis action movie?
Easy. No question. Die Hard.
Agreed. Greatest Van Damme action movie?
Uh, been a while since I've seen one. The only one I remember is the one where he's on a train.
Greatest Angelina Jolie action movie?
There are only two real choices. Salt or Lara Croft. Lara Croft wins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they'll do another Sherlock Holmes movie.
Yeah, it's been a while.
They seemed to leave the last one open for a sequel.
Wide open!
At any rate, if they don't do another in that series, I'm sure they'll reboot.
True. There's like a gazillion Holmes movies.
Yeah, and that show.
With Cumberbatch?
Yeah.
That one's kinda weird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Da Vinci Code.
Based on the Dan Brown novel?
Yes.
Who's the French girl in that?
Audrey Tautou, from Amelie.
Right, with the ever cool Tom Hanks.
Yes, directed by Opie himself, Ron Howard.
What was the weird religiou group?
Opus Dei.
Right, I think there is a real group by that name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Death Wish for my criminal justice class.
That's an oldie.  Charles Bronson?
Yes.  He was stoic as ever.
Who played his wife.
Hope Lange.
Who directed it?
Michael Winner.
Who's the cop?
Vincent Gardenia.
He's great - really looks like a cop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched a few Stallone movies over the weekend.
Which ones? He's got tons of movies.
Rambo was the first one.
Great movie. Sort of felt bad for him in that.
Yeah, me too.
All he wanted to do, was pass through town.
See racism in a different form.
I know, just because of the way he looked.
He did some crazy things to those soldiers.
Yes, they didn't know who they were messing with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite action movie has to be Rambo.
Which one of the 12?
I'm prettey sure they only made 4.
OK, so which of the 4?
First Blood.
That was pretty spot on.
I really liked Brian Denehey.
The cop?
Yeah, the Sherrif
He was a great bad guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen a good kung fu movie?
There is a movie called Kung Fu Hustle.
What is that about?
It is a supernatural action movie about people terrorizing a town.
That sounds very intense. Are there good fighting scenes?
There are some very memorable ones.
What is one of the best ones?
There is a scene where people fight by playing music.
That sounds pretty ridiculous. Does it fit the movie?
It does. You have to see it and you will understand.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you say that Robocop is a satirical action film?
Absolutely. It satirizes the culture of consumerism and greed in America.
Yeah that seemed really evident in the way ridiculous commercials were placed into the film at intervals.
The commercials were pretty funny as well.
Yeah, I especially enjoyed the commercial for the 6000-SUX.
That was a good one. Did you think they made good use of violence?
Sometimes it felt unnecessary, but I think overall it added to the commentary on American culture.
How do you mean?
Well, I think in a way the audience is meant to feel shame for enjoying the ultra violence depicted on screen.
That is an interesting take.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what was the movie where the guy went on a rampage after his dog got killed?
I think you are thinking of John Wick.
Yep, that's the one!
Have you seen it yet?
I was thinking about it. Is it good?
Yeah it's fantastic.
What's so good about it?
There's a vast underground world of assassins which John Wick has to navigate and interact with.
Oh that does sound fun. Are the fight scenes good?
Yeah, the action scenes are some of the best i've ever seen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie "Extortion"?
The one about the man and wife and boy on vacation in the Caribean?
Yes and they got stranded on an island with no gas or water until those guys pull up in a boat.
That was crazy, wanting a million dollars to save them.
Yeah but it was crazier when they tried to kill him by locking him in the boat and sinking it.
That guy had like 9 lives through the whole movie.
I know, and the whole time his wife and kid are still on the island.
He went through hell, getting shot, stabbed, hooked, and still survived.
and that mexican he found that knew where the island was gets hit by a truck.
Yeah that was stupid, and whispers his last words where his family was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best Lord of the Rings movie?
That's a nearly impossible question to answer.  They were all exceptional.
I'm with you.  The third probably had the best action.
Do you mean the big battle at the end at the gates of Mordor or the one outside the city?
Pick either one.  There were tons of good examples in that movie.
I always thought that Helms Deep from the second movie was my favorite.
That one definitely had a very intimate feel since the scale was grand, but centralized.
It helped that they were so outnumbered.
I'll have to watch the series again to give you the best answer.
Let's go watch the first movie right now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Mad Max is probably the best action film in a long time.
It's up there.  It's basically a nonstop car chase.
I was a bit disappointed that it didn't win more Oscars.
It's kind of tough for a film like that to win outside of some technical categories.
But it was very deserving.  Great performances, great direction...
But it's not really the type of movie to convince the academy.
Do they have any plans for a sequel?
Not that I've heard.  Might be a few years if it did happen.
I'll be first in line when it's released if it's released.
I'll be right there with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Lucy last night.
I loved that movie.  Scarlett Johansson was great.
Yes, she sure was.
Who directed?
Luc Besson, from Taken.
He does good work.  I forget the other actors.
Morgan Freeman was the only one I recognized.
Wasn't that a wild ending?
Yes, Lucy dematerializes.
Such a waste of a body!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Man on Fire?
No. What's that?
It's an older action movie with Denzel Washington.
Really, I never heard of it.
We watched it when it first came out. They actually have it on T.V. now.
On regular channels or HBO?
Regular channels. It's from 2004.
It's that old and I never saw it. What's it about?
He's a bodyguard for a lttle girl and things go wrong.
Denzel Washington plays great roles. Especially in action films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Taken on You Tube last night.
Good movie.  Liam Neeson?
Yes.  Written by Luc Besson.
Who is the director?
Pierre Morel.
Who plays the daughter?
Maggie Grace.
Isn't she being auctioned off?
Yes, but Neeson kills the corrupt Arab in the end.
Is that pc?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your opinion of the movie suicide squad
I actually liked it
You did?
Yeah i heard so many people do not like it
Why though
I think they hate the plot
i enjoyed it sorta too
Yeah it was nowhere near as bad as it was made out to be
Exactly
Just a victim of expectations
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
If you could be a character from an action movie who would you be?
Oh, interesting question.
Take your time.
I really love the fifth element, so bruce willis' character in that.
Oh good choice love that movie.
Yeah it's a classic.
I love Chris Tucker's character.
Ruby Rod!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite action movie?
I've always liked Die Hard.
Die Hard is one of my favorites too. Bruce Willis is awesome in that movie.
Did you know Arnold Schwarzenegger was originally offered the role of John McClane?
Really? I can't picture Arnold Schwarzenegger in Die Hard.
Me either. The role of John McClane was suited for Bruce Willis.
I agree. What other Bruce Willis movies do you like?
I liked The Jackal. It's also an action movie.
Isn't Richard Gere in that movie too?
Yes, Richard Gere plays the good guy, while Bruce Willis play the villain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like action movies?
I really like them
One of my favorites is looper
That one was really cool
Its a great movie
I forgot about it til you brought it up
I know i havent seen it in forever
Me either
I want to watch it again now
Same
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Will Smith action movie?
I have so many it's hard to pick just one.
I would have to say Independence Day is my all time favorite.
That is by far the highest grossing movie on his resume.
I could still watch it over and over till this day.
I think Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence might be my favorite.
Yeah that has to be one of the best buddy cop movies of all times.
Can forget the Men In Black movies.
Please i'm still waiting on the next MIB installment.
I would love to see a crossover movie with Men in Black and Guardians of the Galaxy. So epic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite action movie?
I think Rambo is.
That's a classic.
Sure is. Rambo really does some damage.
I don't blame him. They should've just left him alone.
He told them he was just passing through.
Well those simple minds in that little town sure learned.
Sylvester Stallone is great in action films.
Yeah, those muscles really come in handy.
He is just good in every movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We wanted to go to the movies but there isn't much in.
Go see The Great Wall if it's playing.
Which is that one?
With Matt Damon.
Is that the one where he's in China and fights along side them.
Yes. He's a mercenary.
Did you see it?
Yes, it was very good.
Was there a lot of killing and fighting in the war.
Oh yes. You'll enjoy it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man what's your favorite Chuck Norris movie?
Delta Force and you?
Me, too! I love the chase scene in Beirut.
That's good, but when they storm the terrorist compound at the old school, that's better.
You have a point, I especially like when Chuck Norris shoots the radio after the one terrorist leaders offers to negotiate.
That is fun, and so's when the terrorist reinforcments charge the school, only to turn right around when Chuck triggers the explosive charges they rigged to it.
Yeah, that's funny, they're all gung-ho charging forward and then they are falling over each other to get away.
Yeah, but Lee Marvin has one of the best scences.
Which one?
The one where he has that captured guy call the terrorist in the plane, and he comes out yelling " what", and Marvin shoots him right between the eyes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
What kinds of movies do you like?
All kinds.
Do you like action?

XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you have a favorite action movie?
Hmm.
Take your time.
I would probably say Hudson Hawk.
The Bruce Willis movie?
Yeah that's the one.
You know, I've never seen it.
It's a great 80's movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So James Bond movies, which ones are best?
I loved the older ones.
Like true Ian Fleming ones?
Yes, set closer to the time he was actually like a secret agent.
I love the action in them. So much all the time.
Did you like the newer one, the Casino Royal?
No, I do not like Daniel Craig as bond.
I think he was a bit too scruffy for the role.
Exactly, Sean Connery was the real bond for me.
That smooth talker. I loved he and Money Penny's interactions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the new Transformers movie that's coming out?
No I haven't, what is the name of it?
It's Transformers: The Last Knight and is directed by Michael Bay.
Awesome, I hope this one lives up to the hype from the rest of them.
Me too, the last couple of movies that Michael Bay put out have been hit or miss.
Ya but they action in them have still been good. I have high expectations for this movie.
Why is that? The last one that came out was a disappointment for me.
I think that Mark Wahlberg will do another good job of acting in this movie. Michael Bay does make good movies at times.
You're right, I will go into this movie with an open mind and hopefully the movie turns out good.
Awesome! I look forward to seeing it with you when it comes out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you ever seen the movie Dumb and Dumber?
Yeah, it's a hilarious movie!
Do you prefer Jeff Daniels or Jim Carrey in that film?
I think Jim Carrey, he's always funny.
Yeah, he is a very bankable comedic actor.
What was your favorite line from the film?
"We've landed on the moon!"
Yes! That is a great line!
What was your favorite line or scene?
I think the scene where he talks to the guys about Big Gulps was my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Thor?
Yes that was a good movie
Loki is crazy
Absolutely
It made me a little sad though
How come
I wanted thor to stay on earth with his new girlfriend
Yes that would have been ideal
It would
I guess it was a little sad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that new movie with Tom Cruise?
I don't think I have, whats it called?
The Edge of Tomorrow.
Oh, I have actually heard of that. Is it any good?
Yes, I loved it. A lot of action.
What is it about?
Basically machines from an alien planet are taking over the world and they can predict all human movements.
Wow, that really sounds intense.
Yep, I highly recommend watching it.
I will have to check it out sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the action movie, Escape Plan?
No, who was in it?
It had Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
It sounds like an old movie.
No, it's not that old, and I watched it last night.
How did you like the movie?
I thought that it was pretty good for a Stallone movie.
I'll have to check that out. Can I get that streaming?
Yeah, it's streaming right now on Netflix.
Great. I just renewed my subscription.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you heard of the upcoming black panther movie?
i have and i am so in love with the trailer already!

chadwick really is a good actor for black panther.
i agree!. he really is suitable for the role
the trailer was kind of sad though.
how so? did it bother you when his father died?
yes, it did, but i hope he become one of the best super heroes!
i second that statement!
but the movie will be a while until it is released. lets hope its as good as the trailer shows us.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch guardians of the galaxy Vol 2?
Yeah I did. loved it.
Me too. I think it captured a bunch of essense of the first one.
Yeah all the lovable characters were back and they didn't lose a step.
I also like how they can be good guys, but still act bad.
yeah the good guy bad guy aspect makes it way better than most movies like it.
What did you think about StarLords dad?
I thought that made the story very cool.
Yeah knowing he is partially a god made me happy.
Yeah i loved the little groot! was super cute!
XXXXXXXXXXX

Have you ever seen a Sinbad movie?
No I haven't. What is a good one?
I would check out the one called Jingle All The Way.
What is that about?
It is a holiday movie about two people trying to get toy for their kids.
Interesting. Is there a lot of action?
There is a lot of action. They have a battle of the wits and things are always happening.
I never knew there were action holiday movies.
Well now you know. Check this out as soon as you can.
I will do this soon. Sinbad is such a cool name!
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched The Trasnporter one and two this weekend.
The Transporter. Is that Science Fiction?
No,  great action movies with Jason Statham.
Is he a bad guy again?
Well no and yes.
What's that mean?
He is hired to get people somewhere and only goes after people who try to attack.
Guess that's why it's called Transporter.
You got it. Lots of classic Statham action.
I should watch both in one night. Maybe this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Expendables was an excellent movie.
Sounds familiar, who's in it?
Sylvestor Stallone and Jason Statham.
Don't remember if I watched that one.
It's from 2010. They were mercenaries.
Theres so many movies like that.
Yes, but not with those two in it.
True, then I guess I didn't see it.
It's an hour and fourty minutes but it goes so fast.
Lots of action with those two. Thats why.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Central Intelligence with The Rock?
I think so. That one also has Kevin Hart in it, right?
Yeah they're both in it.
I just saw it last week!
Did you like it?
I did! It was so funny.
I know. The Rock and Kevin are both hilarious.
I love the part when Bob slaps Jet during the therapy session.
That scene was great. There were so many good ones.
Right? Just the two of them standing side by side was cracking me up with their size difference.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen fast five?
Yes thats my favorite fast and furious movie
