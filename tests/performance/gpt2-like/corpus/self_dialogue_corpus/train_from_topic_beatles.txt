When did you start to like the Beatles? I was six.
I was older then that, around eight.
It was through my brothers
My girlfriend was nuts about them. All we'd listened to when at her house.
The question that everyone asks - who is you favorite? Mine is Paul.
My favorite changed. First it was Paul then George.
George? John is usually the one that people change to.
When George came into his own, was when I started.
Have you seen the band or any of them in concert? I've seen Ringo and His All Starr band and they were great.
No. I surpose I still can, can't I?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Just sitting here listening to Breakfast with the Beatles..It's on on Sunday mornings on the local rock station. Good Stuff.
Oh yeah, I don't know much about the Beatles. They're pretty old right.
Yeah, they've been around a long time, but their songs are so classic. Hey Jude is one of my favorites.
I love the song Yesterday...that's them right?
Yep, they had a ton of good songs, although some times they got a little wierd.
What do you mean?
Well there is one called "I am the eggman" at least I think that's what it is, and it is strange. Literally they say "I am the eggman, I am the walrus..coo coo coo choo"
WTH? Really? They must have been on some serious stuff.
Maybe, it was the 60's after all. I know alot of people say John Lennon was a drug user.
Didn't he get shot?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I was listening to the radio yesterday and i heard "Yesterday."
How ironic...do you like the Beatles then?
Yes, I remember my brothers listening to them when I was growing up.
yes, that's funny, me too. My sister loves Sergeant Pepper's album/
That is  a good one.  When I was a kid, my dad brought home the White Album.  I had never seen a white record before!
That has "While my guitar gently weeps" right?
Yes, George Harrison was an amazing talent.
True, he and John lennon were the most talented of the four.
I adore John, although I despise yoko of course.
Well, she broke them up, so I can understand that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the Beatles have a channel on Sirius/XM now?
So it's lots of Beatles music?
That and similar artists.
Interesting. I might have to check it out.
It's channel 18.
Thanks. I'll see if I like it.
I'm surprised it took this long to make a channel for them.
So am I considering the other artists that got one before.
I always said they should have one.
I've said that before. They are so influencial.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey what do you think of the Beatles ?
I think they were the best rock group in history
have you ever heard a song called a hard days night ?
yes I have heard it on an oldies station at my job brings me great memories.
do you think john lennon was a good leader in the beatles ?
yes he brought the beatles to world fame and in music history.
what do you think of a song called can't buy me love ?
it is a great composition by the beatles about money and love great song.
do you think john lennon expressed what he felt about life in his album called imagine ?
yes john lennon and the beatles changed rock music forever they made history since 1964.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles album?
I like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band but my favorite has to be the White Album.
Really? I thought that album was a bit of a downer.
Are you kidding? The first time I heard, "While my guitar gently weeps," it absolutely blew me away.
That's not even in the same league as "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
I never really got into that song.
Too bad, that whole album absolutely captivated me for an entire year.
It's really hard to find a bad Beatles album, isn't it?
I know what you mean. I can't imagine how they produced so many epic songs.
Yeah, even the song "Imagine" is the first song you thing of when you hear that word.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever listened to the Beatles?
I'm a little bit of a fan.
Who was your favorite?
I always thought they were the best together.
Well, who did you think had the best solo career?
I used to prefer John, but now I guess I'd rather listen to Paul's solo stuff.
What is your favor song that Paul released?
I don't know, maybe Live and Let Die, or Band on the Run.
What was your favorite song by John?
Definately Imagine, but he did a good cover of Stand By Me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to the beatles
No, i'm not much of a fan
Really? why?
Well I'm a fan of Elvis Presley, and its hard to be a fan of both
Are they rivals
Yeah they were pretty big rivals in the music industry
Well have you heard any of their music?
Yeah well I listened to Hey jude and it was a little bit boring
What! That song is a legend!
It just didn't do much for me
XXXXXXXXXXX
How paul McCartney turning 75 this month.
Wow,no kidding. Where has the time gone.
I remember seeing the Beatles on ed Sullivan.
Yup,me too.
Seems like yesterday.
No pun intended?
Hahahahah,right,no pun intended.
That was a great song though.
One of the best.
That was all paul.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
Yeah all of the time.
What album?
Rubber Soul.
Which song do you like?
Drive my car.
I like that song a lot!
Isn't it great?
I like Nowhere Man personally.
Another fantastic song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the beatles music
I havent really listened to them
You should, theyre great
Whats one of there famous songs
Hey jude
I think ove heard that one
You probably have
Im going to google it now
Okay
Great talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you familiar with the song "Hey Jude"?
Yeah, it's a Beatles song, right?
Right. I was just reading the other day that John Lennon wrote that song for his oldest son, Julian.
Really? I didn't know that!
Yeah, he seemed to enjoy writing songs about his family.
That's really cool. Can you name any others?
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" is about a picture that Julian drew for him at school.
Wow, Julian inspired some great music, didn't he?
He sure did.
Maybe I should try listening to those songs again now that I know what they're about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen across the universe, the movie?
Yes, I loved it so much.
Me too. i don't know why it was not better received critically.
I am baffled as well. I see something new and powerful in it each new viewing.
What is your favorite cover in it?
I think while my guitar gently weeps was very well done. The vocals those actors have were so raw and emotion filled.
Martin Luther McCoy was the actor who sang that one.
I think I enjoyed his version even more than the original.
That is saying something, to out do a beatle.
It is indeed. I really did feel his vocals were just that powerful on an already great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the Beatles is your favorite?
Honestly, George Harrison is my pick. He's one of my favorite guitarists of all time.
Good pick! Personally, I'd have to say Paul McCartney, I love him with Wings too.
So, what do you think about Ringo?
Ringo who? Oh yeah, almost forgot about him....
Hahahaha! Everyone seems to forget about Ringo!
He can't seem to catch a break, now can he? At least he and Paul are still alive though.
Some people think Paul is actually dead, and was replaced. Isn't that funny?
That's almost as absurd as saying Gucci Mane died and was cloned!
Yeah, some people believe the dumbest things!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite sequence of Beatles songs on a studio album.
Oh, you know I do. It's on Abbey Road, does that give it away?
I can actually think of a few great sequences on that album. Which one is the best?
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window into Golden Slumbers into Carry that Weight.
Right! Those songs flow together so incredibly well!
I know, it's a brilliant transition musically. It doesn't feel forced at all. What song transitions did you have in mind?
I was thinking of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band into With a Little Help from My Friends into Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. It's such a great range of pop songs.
Yes, and it shows that even the doofy Ringo could write a great song.
Oh man, it has been a long time since I've listened to Sgt. Pepper. I think this year is the fiftieth anniversary.
I think you're right. It came out in 1967 so that would make fifty years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, can you play Beatles songs on your guitar?
Yeah, a few.
What's the hardest one to play?
Hmm, there are some tough ones. I'm learning Here Comes the Sun, and it's pretty tricky.
Oh really? It sounds so pretty.
Yeah, the guitar part is tricky, you have to capo really high on the fret board — I usually just play it in open tuning though.
What else?
Come together is pretty tricky too. It's not horrible, but it's not easy either.
It's such a cool song though.
Yeah, I love singing it! Generally, most of the George Harrison songs are tough because he was such a good guitar player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles fan?
I like some of their stuff.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
I like "Hey Jude" and some of the later stuff.
I really like the early stuff, like "If I Fell" and "In My Life".
Yes, those are good songs, too, but I feel the later stuff has more of a rock n roll sound to it.
Yes they did get heavier as the years went on for sure.
I do like the "Rubber Soul" album, though. That had a lot of good music on it.
That's one of my favorites, too! As well as The White Album.
Yes, there were many good songs from The White Album, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ringo is my favorite Beatle. George is second.
I like their solo stuff but not so much Johns or Paul's.
It's funny how John and Paul seem to be favored more, though.
I know. They are popular.
I even liked Ringo as the conductor on Shining Time Station.
What's that?
A TV show for kids.
Ah. I never heard of it but if he's in it I'd like it.
We can find epesodes on Youtube.
My favorite Beatles song is 'A Little Help from my Friends' which Ringo sings lead on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so glad that iTunes finally has the Beatles music.
Me too! I used to have to switch to a different app when I wanted to listen to them, which was annoying.
What is your ultimate favorite Beatles track?
That is a hard question; there are so many great ones! Maybe Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da?
Yes, Ob-La-Di is so good! I'm actually not sure what it is about though.
Me either, I just like song! What is your favorite?
Probably Strawberry Fields Forever, another Beatles song that I'm not totally sure what the meaning is.
Strawberry Fields Forever is good, not my favorite though.
What about Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds?
Oh, I love Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds! My best friend is named Lucy, and that song always makes me think of her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you ever into the Beatles when you were a kid?
Definitely. My mom bought me the Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album.
That's a good one. What's your favorite song on that album?
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is my favorite.
Nice. My favorite is With a Little Help from my Friends.
Did you know Ringo wrote that one?
I didn't know that. Who wrote Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?
I think it was Lennon.
I listened to one of their greatest hits albums. I can't remember the name. Anyway, that's what I was into when I was a kid.
I agree. Their music is so easy to listen to, and it reminds me of my childhood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yes officer, I was visiting my friend Eleanor Rigby who lives on Penny Lane.
That’s near the Beatles Strawberries Fields Forever am I correct?
Yes, we had tickets for the Magic Mystery Tour but we encountered Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Heart’s gang.
And then what happened?
They said they were Fixing A Hole for Martha My Dear?
And that’s when all Helter Skelter broke out?
Well, The Girl Sexy Sadie said they started working on the hole the night before
The office thought silently to himself before he spoke...
And Your Bird Can Sing right? So how many of the Beatles songs do you think the two of us have mentioned?
No Reply. The End.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the song "Yellow Submarine"?
Yes, it's one of my favorite songs by the Beatles. It was on the Revolver album.
Did you know that Paul McCartney wrote it as a children's song?
Really? There's no hidden meaning in it like some other Beatles songs?
Nope. Paul was just trying to write a song for Ringo Starr to sing, and this is what he came up with. I guess John Lennon helped out a little.
Wow. I guess people can make lyrics mean anything they want! What other songs were on that album?
Let's see...it was released in 1966, so probably Eleanor Rigby and She Said She Said.
Oh, right. Those were great songs as well.
Wasn't the Revolver album the last album the Beatles recorded before they stopped any live performances?
Yes, I think so. It was also the one where they included both psychedelic music and Indian music. Sort of an odd combination.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who I have really been getting into lately?
Who is that?
The Beatles. They are so timeless.
Well you know that I am a huge fan.
What is your favorite song?
Really? Just one?
All time favorite song, go!
All time I guess I would have to say The Long and Winding Road. It reminds me of my dad.
That is a good one. I really like another cliche one, Let it Be.
It may be cliche, but it is so good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is the most memorable beatles song for you?
I think for me it is blackbird.
Really that is not one of the super popular ones.
I think it was a big song for them. But more than that my dad played it over and over again so really stuck with my image of them.
I would say imagine .
Wasn't that a solo work by John lennon, not really the band's song.
You may be right, I do think it is one of the most recognizable songs ever though.
Fair enough, it is a great song with a deeply important message of peace.
John was so much for peace. So sad he was assasinated.
Yes it was a tragic loss for music and the world.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder why the Beatles got so popular
Well because they were good
I mean they are decent
Gotta remember their era
Well even still there was better
Like?
The kinks and Blue Cheer
The 60s did have good music
Precisely
Man we gotta jam some now
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of The Beatles?
I have no clue what that is.
Are you kidding?
Not at all. Are you going to stop being rude and explain?
Um, only one of the most famous pop rock bands of all time?
So...like One Direction?
No, like The Beatles. Sgt. Peppers, A Day In The Life...the Beatles!
Yeah, not ringing a bell.
You are the bane of my existence. Please listen to the beatles. They're classic.
If you say so...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to John Lennon?
From the Beatles?
Yeah, didn't he die?
Yeah, back in 1980.
How did he die?
Someone killed him.
Wow, who killed him?
It was a crazy fan.  Mark David Chapman, I think.
Oh, so how did he kill him?
He shot him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that there was a different original drummer for the Beatles?
It wasn't always Ringo Starr?
No, it was a guy named Pete Best.
Why did he quit?
I don't know if he quit or was kicked out.
Oh, wow that sucked for him.
Yeah, but it turned out good for Ringo.
What kind of name is Ringo anyway?
His name is actually Richard.
Oh, yeah, I think I read that somewhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know when the Beatles will be making a comeback?
I don't know man. They are old and lazy now. I they all retired.
They retired? I didn't know that. I thought they still go on tour.
Paul McCartney still does concerts, but he does them as a solo act.  Yes, they broke up years ago and retired the band.
Why'd they do that?
Its a complicated story. One of the main Beatles wanted to go solo, and that caused the dissolution of the band.
Why did he want to go solo?
I don't know. But most of the time when a group member wants to go solo, it means that he or she leaves because of money reasons.
Money reasons? What do you mean by that?
Yeah, he probably thought he could make more money if he went solo. I think it was John Lennon, who left the group first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Beatles got their name.
I think it had something to do with the fact they really liked Buddy Holly's rock and roll band the Crickets.
Yeah, they called themselves "The Silver Beetles" and later it became "The Beatles".
They were a great group. They became famous in the 1960's and changed rock and roll.
I remember seeing the girls go crazy on television around them.
I heard the girls would pull their hair and clothes just to have a small piece of them.
The girls would become so excited they would actually faint.
When did they break up?
In September 1969 John Lennon told them he was leaving the group but they did not announce it until 1970.
Well, I think they all did pretty good on their own as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you know the Beatles?
Yeah, of course.
Well, Sergeant Pepper just turned 50 years old.
Wow! No way.
Yeah, what's your favorite song from the album?
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Oh, that one's really good!
Yeah, I think so too.
My favorite is "Getting Better."
That was my second choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Beatles deserve to be considered great composers, along with Beethoven and the like?
Well, it's funny because just today I was watching an interview where Paul McCartney said that classical composers were the pop artists of their day.
That's interesting to think about, yeah. And the Beatles helped the public see that.
Yeah, the obvious artistic quality of their music really helped the public rethink pop music in a big way.
It's true! Though they also created a kind of false dichotomy, I think.
You mean between "Serious Pop" and "Lightweight Pop," right?
Yeah, exactly. Because people today still love to trash artists like Justin Bieber, comparing him to the Beatles.
Well, his music doesn't seem too conceptually ambitious, to be fair. The Beatles just kept pushing things forward, artistically.
Yeah, when you look at how far they progressed since about 1963 to 1967 or 1968...
Totally! The leap from "Love Me Do" to the White Album is incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any Beatles albums?
No, but if I did which should I get?
Not sure. There's a collection of number one songs.
That might be good. I'm only a casual fan.
I hardly like them. That album is enough for me.
I'm sure it would have most of the songs I like on it.
It has twenty-something songs.
I'll check it out so I can add it to my collection.
Amazon has it.
Good to know. I bet they also have samples I can play.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever listen to the Beatles?
Off and on.
It's incredible how much music they had, right?
Yeah, and they weren't really active that long.
I know.  They were together not even ten years.
Yeah, well popular that long at least.
In America they became famous in 63 and broke up in the late 60s.
In 69 I think.
Yeah, that sounds right.
I can't believe they never got back together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you know the Beatles?
Yeah sure.
Do you have a favorite song?
I really like Help.
Why is that your favorite?
My mom would play it all the time in the car when I was growing up.
Oh like a nostalgia type thing.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm listening to the Beatles!
That's cool. What song?
I Want to Hold Your Hand.
Have you seen the movie Across the Universe?
Yeah! Did you like it?
Yes. I liked the scene with I Want to Hold Your Hand.
I haven't seen the movie but I want to.
Glee also covered that song too!
I saw that one. Kurt sang it right?
Yeah. It made me cry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite song?
Octopus Garden.
Why that one?
Because it talks about Octopus. What is your favorite?
Hey Jude.
Why?
I like the melody.
What does the song talk about?
It talks about son of John Lenon.
Oh yeah, it was written by Paul McCartney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
is the beatles the best group
i think there in my top ten

XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the beatles?
of course, I grew up listening to them with my parents
do you like the oldies?
I do, I like many genres
which beatle is your favorite?
Paul McCartney is my favorite, every interview I saw with him made him look like a down to earth guy
do you have a favorite song?
I would have to say "Yesterday", I tend to like a soft vocal
That is a great one, I love that too, mine is Penny lane
Oh yes, I can sing every word to that one
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was watching a children's show a couple days ago with my cousins. There was a parody of the Sgt. Pepper's Band.
Did they have the band uniforms on?
They did. Four of the characters had on the right color uniforms.
That sounds awesome. The Sgt. Pepper album is one of my favorites.
Mine too! Not only is the music great, but the art is fantastic as well.
I love the concept behind it. What's your favorite track on the album?
I love "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"; but I also love "When I'm Sixty-Four", "Lovely Rita", and "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite", too. It's too hard to pick.
"With a Little Help from my Friends", is my favorite. All the songs on the album are great, though.
It's hard to think that the album recently celebrated it's fiftieth anniversary.
It really is. Fifty years later and the music is still great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you surmise is the best Beatles album?
Sargeant Peppers
Yeah I would tend to agree with that one.
It just has so many classics on it
The variety of music is present on the album
I actually have it on album too
I think they poured their hearts into it
Yeah they didnt leave anything on the table.
Can you see a band having that kind of an album again?
Maybe but we wouldnt be around to hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
the beatles wrote some of the most iconic love songs of all time
even more than bruno mars?
yes, don't be stupid
give me an example, then!
you shouldn't even need an example. i have one word for you: something
as in the song?
yeah, the best love song of all time!
can't be that good if he ended up breaking up with the girl
wow!
just saying. i guess it's a good song though, whatever
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the Beatles?
Yes I am. We had a lot of Beatles music in our wedding.
Oh nice! Which songs?
"In my life", "something"...
That sounds lovely.
The Beatles music is very special to us as a couple.
Is there any reason?
Yes We didn't have much when we first met and we spent a lot of time listening to the few cds we had.
And I guess one of those was the Beatles?
Yes exactly. Abby Road was a favorite of ours.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Abbey Road?
That is my favorite album
Whats the best song on there?
I like Come Together
I like that one too. My favorite is You Never Give Me Your Money
That one has a great melody
Do you like their older albums?
Yes, I like the early stuff too, like She Loves You
Yes, but their later stuff is the best.
Oh I agree. Their studio stuff is the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What year did the Beatles first visit the United States
I believe it was 1964
What year were they formed?
1960
Where?
Liverpool
What was there first number one hit?
Please Please Me
Can you name the drummer that replaced Pete Best?
Ringo Starr
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
Of course. I love, "In My LIfe, I Love You More."
Rubber Soul was a great album.
What other songs were on that album? Do you know?
We Can Work It Out and Day Tripper.
Nice! I think my favorite album was Yellow Submarine.
I like their early stuff better. Hard to beat Let It Be.
I agree.
They'll never be another band like the Beatles.
Right. The right band at the right time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
I've always loved Yellow Submarine.
That's interesting. What do you like about that song?
I like the atmosphere and vibe of it.
Oh, because of the sound effects and all that?
Right, it's put together very well. The song tells a story with the music, lyrics, and the sounds effects.
My favorite song is A Day in the Life.
Yeah, that's a great one.
I like how experimental it is. I also like seeing the clear contrast between John and Paul contained in one song.
Yeah, the differences between each part are quite overt, but somehow it all fits together and works.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not a huge fan of the beatles generally
oh wow. that is blasphemy
I do really like one of their songs though
oh yeah, which one?
revolution
that's an awesome song, classic
isn't all of there stuff considered classic
pretty much
once i hear revolution, I can't get it out of my head though
it happens
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the beatles song Real Love?
I don't think I know that one.
I think a lot of people don't.. which is too bad. It is such a nice message.
They have so many songs it is hard to keep track of them all.
Well I do see your point. Do you know when I'm 64?
I do know that. I enjoy it very much.
Ya it is a cute one. Kind of on the short side though.
I never noticed if it is. I will say the lana del rey song young and beautiful song lyrics make me think back to When I'm 64.
Never made that connection before but that is very true.
Yes same them, will you still love me when... I am old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles fan?
I like the early stuff, but not the weird stuff.
What's the weird stuff?
Yellow Submarine.
Yellow Submarine is weird?
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
I thought you were a big Beatles fan?
Just the pop stuff.
It's all pop stuff.
Not in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why is Paul so popular amongst the Beatles?
Disproportionately? I mean, he was a main songwriter in the band.
Maybe not disproportionately. I just wonder if there are reasons other than that.
Well, he's really a pretty underrated bassist, for one thing.
Hmm. How so?
His lines would be off on their own, not following the guitar with root notes.
That's true if I think about it. Lucy in the Sky seems comes to mind.
He's arguably underrated by this metric, since people falsely think technical skill is a great way to rate a musician.
Yeah. It's not like he's shredding all over the place. They're just memorable.
And imaginative. You have to remember that especially in their early days, this is when much of rock n' roll was really laying the blues ripoff thing thick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles fan?
Yeah! I grew up on their music.
What's your favorite album?
I don't have a favorite albums, but I do have some favorite songs.
Like what?
I really like Eleanor Rigby and Hey Jude
Did you watch Across the Universe?
I did! I actually liked some of their covers better than the originals.
That's crazy! You might not want to tell some people that.
I know. I've made some people upset when I said that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am interested in seeing some unique covers of the Beatles music
How would you want them to be unique
Well you know take some libertys with the music
But that would not be a cover
Sure it would
It should be similar though
well i did not say it could not be similar
That is confusing
It can be different and similar
how so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think you can name all of the members of the Beatles?
Of course, John, Paul, George and Ringo.
Do you know their last names?
Sure, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
Do you know who was the youngest?
I think it was Paul.
No it was George.
I thought John and Ringo were the same age. I knew they were older than Paul.
Yeah, they were all pretty young when they started.
They did pretty good for themselves that's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Beatles album?
This is really a hard one to pick.
I will start it off than. I really liked Revolver. This album changed the way people thought of albums.
Good pick,but clearly Sgt Pepper is the best.
Why? What is your argument?
Simple,while Revolver was a new thing we will find Sgt. Pepper was the GOAT of albums.
Yea,but I still like Revolver better. It even had a better album cover.
Well, if we are going to talk album covers that it doesn't get more iconic than Sgt.Pepper's album cover.
Well, I guess we agree to disagree.
Well,we can agree ob one thing both Revolver and Sgt. Pepper are iconic albums.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of Paul McCartney's band?
You mean the Beatles?
No, the one after the Beatles broke up.
Oh, in the 70s and 80s?
Yeah, what was his band's name?
I think it was Wings.
Yeah, that's it.
Why do you ask?
I was wondering the name of the song they did for the James Bond movie.
Oh, that was Live and Let Die.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you think that Lennon/McCartney are prolific song writers?
Yes, I think they and the Beatles are the best musicians of the 20th century.  Do you have a favorite song?
All My Loving and a Hard Day's Night are two of my favorites.
Yes, and the movie Hard Day's Night was great too.
I remember watching that movie with John, Paul, Ringo, and George in a theater downtown when I was a kid.
I prefer their early music like Love Me Do and when they performed on Ed Sullivan.
While I like Sgt. Pepper's just fine, I still like their early music too.
How do you feel about later performances when it was just Paul McCartney?
I think his live concerts are great, especially when he sings Yesterday.
That song is great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the beatles
Yes they are a great band
I agree
We need more like them
Exactly
Ive listened to them my whole life
I only started to losten to them recently
Whats your favorite song so far
Yesterday
Good choice
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to The Beatles?
Yes sometimes.
What is your favorite album?
Revolver.
Which song from that?
For No One.
Oh interesting choice.
I also like Good Day Sunshine.
That is my favorite!
Wow cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your top beatle song ?
I always loved, Help!
That is a interesting choice.I often forget about that song.
Glad I could help you remember it.. hahaha.
What is your top pick?
I would have to go with yesterday.
Yesterday is such a beautiful melody I can see that being many people's favorite.
The lyrics are so moving, like many beatles songs. True lyrical genius.
I agree one of the strengths of theirs was in the lyrics. I think they all wrote certain songs.
I believe you are correct though most were paul and john I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's so hard to believe Beatle songs are more than 50 years old!
I know.  And I only ever bought one album - Rubber Soul.
I like how their music changed through the years.
Like Sgt. Pepper.  Those songs had deep meaning.
The songs bring back so many memories.
I can associate the songs with good times in my life.
The wrote such wonderful songs that hold meanings for so many people.
Yes. Their songs stand the test of time.
So sad they broke up.  But at least they continued solo careers.
So sad John and George are not here.  But their music lives on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey,I'm going to see Paul McCartney in September.
Really,where?
In Syracuse. Only about a three hour drive.
That's cool,I've never seen him.
This will be the fifth time I've seen him.
The show has to be great!
It's incredible. Usually about three hours and almost 40 songs.
Wow,he has enough of them.
He does have a lot. Sings a lot of Beatles,wings,and solo.
I've got to see him before he retires.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Beatles?
Yeah, they're the only bugs that people really like!
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I like their songs "Mr. Postman" and "I wanna be your Man"
Yeah those are awesome Beatle songs.
I wish they would have stayed together a lot longer.
Yeah, they are technically the fathers of boy bands.
Yeah, their music is influenced by lot of jazz and blues.
We all need more boy bands like them.
Yeah, that is true. They just don't make music like they used to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite song from Yellow Submarine?
I think it might be Yellow Submarine
You didnt like All You Need is Love?
Thats not what you asked me.
You are right, I think the best is All You Need is Love.
I think its great too but Yellow Submarine as a song was awesome.
The album was a bit different.
It was kind of a step back but you cant keep putting out albums like that.
Sure you can especially this group wrote so many good ones
I just feel like they put out better ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the first time you saw the Beatles?
Yeah on the old Ed Sullivan Show.
When Ed Sullivan anounced them all those girls in the audience went crazy.
I didn't know what the big deal was, at the time.
Me neither I had never heard of the Beatles.
They sang She Loves You...Yeah !! Yeah !! Yeah !!!!!
I still didn't get excited over it.
After hearing it played on the radio ten million times it started to sound pretty good to me.
We were in the midst of Beatlemania.
Right...smack dab in the middle of Beatlemania and didn't know we would be part of history.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Beatles?
Oh, hell yeah!
Dude, me too. They're kind of vintage and cool.
Yeah, they are. What's your favorite song, then?
Octopuses Garden.
Dude, no way. What? That's your favorite song? You have terrible taste.
Alright then, what's your favorite?
Strawberry Fields
A cliche!
I don't care, I love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You listened to the Beatles when you were younger, right?
Sure, I think everyone did.
Well, I wasn't a huge fan until I became an adult.
Really, that is weird.
I was really into Elvis, my mother played his music all of the time.
Oh, so when you did get into the Beatles which one did you think was the cutest.
I switched back and forth. At first I was crazy for Paul.
Yeah, he was so cute but I had a huge crush on John.
I never had a John crush. I would switch to George.
Poor Ringo, he never made the crush list.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite band of all time is The Beatles.
Oh really?  What are your favorite songs?
I have quite a few favorites - some of them are the more popular ones like Let It Be and Hey Jude.
What are some others, like the lesser known ones?
There's one called You Know My Name that I really love.  It's really different.
Oh?  What is different about it?
Well, it's not a typical song.  The listener can tell they were having a lot of fun recording it.
Oh?  How so?
Well, the singers would use different types of voices, rather than just their regular voice.
That sounds really interesting, I'd like to hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favoriate Beatles album?
Definately Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  So influential and unique.  How about you?
I'm a big fan of the White Album.  I think the band really got into their artistic side in that one.
Well I can't argue with that.  The White Album is iconic.  What's your favorite overall Beatle song?
I'd have to say it is Hard Days Night.  It's so upbeat and kinda funny.  How about you?
A day in the life.  Again, Sgt. Pepper's is my favorite album and this song is near perfect to me.
Not a bad choice.  Did you ever watch any Beatle movies? Like Yellow Submarine or Hard Days Night?
I actually can't stand Yellow Submarine.  You do know that the voice parts are not the actual band members right?
Well yeah, but you've got to love that crazy 70's animation though.
Actually, the drawings kinda creep me out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Of course, they're one of the greatest bands in the world!
What's your favorite album?
I love Sgt. Pepper, because it's so iconic and the entire album just flows... they were so creative at that time.
I agree, it really changed the landscape of music.
Do you have a favorite album, besides Sgt. Pepper?
Well, Abbey Road is really top notch... that's another album where they just came together (like the song title!) and made a masterpiece.
Yeah, it's almost like they knew that it would be their last time together, and they wanted to go out with a bang.
I also like Revolver... that's really an underrated album, and really brought psychedelic music out of its shell.
You don't hear too many people put that on their Beatles lists, but you're right... it is an influential album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
the beatles are back!
why you say that?
i found a station that plays alot of there songs
cool can you give me insight on where you found it
yeah online i just goggled it and found this staion
is it a all beatles station?
mostly they play alot of there music
is it 85% beatles are less
i would say it's about 70% of beatles songs and the rest late 70's
i need that radio station cause i love me some beatles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Beatles?
I think they are awesome, I wish they had made more movies, though.
Really? I was talking more about their music.
Oh, yes, I know, I just think their movies were really groundbreaking, especially Hard Days' Night.
I haven't ever seen that.
You should. It's almost like the first feature length music video with a plot. Do you like old Beatles or newer Beatles music?
I don't know, it's hard to say, they both are good in their own way. There's a huge difference between I Want To Hold Your Hand, and Let It Be.
That's true.  There was a lot of innocence in their early music.
Right, and by the time they had been around awhile the lyrics got a lot deeper.
Well, now that you say that, I think that I do prefer their later music, songs like Yesterday, or In my Life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
You a fan of the Beatles?
My mom is a huge fan.
Not you?
I know a few of their songs, but I wouldn't call myself a fan.
What songs do you know of?
Just the big hits.
Like which ones?
I want to hold your hand.  ones like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
George is such an underrated guitarist.
I think he's rated just fine.
His solo on "Taxman" is great.
Actually Paul played that.
No he didn't.
He did, because George couldn't nail a perfect take on the day.
But Paul was the bassist.
Paul can play anything.
I didn't know that.
George is good, but Paul was really a prodigy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you know any good songs from the 70's
what kind of music i like the beatles
yeah  there a oldie but goodie
what did they die and come back
why do you say that
there music is played more than ever
they where a good group folks still love their tunes
everytime i turn on the radio there on it
there music is very relaxing
yeah sometimes i fall asleep at night listen to them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to that 1 album?
Which 1 album?
The album actually titled ONE.
Oh yes is that their greatest hits?
Yes but it is much more than that.
What do you mean by that.
It is one of the greatest albums of all time in the history of music.
Oh wow that is saying a lot.
Yes, the Beatles ONE album is truly amazing.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did the beatlles make a song with john lennon
yeah i think so
what was the name of the song
i think it was come together
yeah thats right that was a hit
that song was number one for a long time
yeah i love it
me too wish they where still here
me also they had people in tears
i cryed to some of there songs and felt good at the same time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
I love their music.
Me too. I grew up listening to their albums.
So did I.
What's your favorite Beatles' song?
It would have to be Hey Jude.
I just heard a live version that Paul McCartney did at one of his concerts awhile back.
Oh I bet that was great.
It really was. He let the audience sing along and it sounded like so much fun.
I need to try to find that and listen to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Beatles are overrated?
No, I don't think so. Their songs are certainly popular, but I don't think that necessarily means overrated.
Yea, I mean their songs are super catchy. And to have that type of sound during that era of music must have been really exciting.
I feel like they were like the original boy band/popstars of their time.
Oh for sure. Their music kind of set the tone for a new era of Rock n Roll.
And their songs were really fun and had a lot of energy.
Yea, I feel like they were really original and were presenting something that was unheard of before.
Songs like "Twist and Shout" and "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" are my favorites.
They're so catchy, but also a lot of their songs sounds really psychedelic which I feel like was kind of the iconic sound of the 60's.
Yea, for sure. But even today you could listen to them and still be into it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the first time you saw the Beatles on Ed Sullivan?
Yes, All those screaming girls, you couldn't hear them sing!
She Loves You was the first song I heard and loved.  My mother said they sounded like they were in pain!
My parents actually liked them. They though their music was very catchy.
Remember that crazy time when everyone thought Paul was dead?
I used to play their record backwards and listen for the secret message.
They were great poets and storytellers.  Some of the songs didn't make sense to me specially on the Sgt Pepper album.
I just sang along to the songs.  I didn't try to figure them out.
Paul was my favorite Beatle.  He was so handsome.  I watched the movie Magical Mystery tour so many times.
The Fool on the Hill was a great song but I Am the Walrus was really strange.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles has always been my favorite group.
What makes you say that?
They were such a big part of my "growing up years".  I think they have really influenced the history of music.
I wonder if they will be remembered and revered as much as the like of Beethoven and Bach?
I think they will be with such diversity in their music.  You have everything from the lively "Twist and Shout" to the subtle, soft songs like "My Michelle" or "Blackbird".
Do you know how many songs Lennon and McCartney have written?
Has to be 100s.  I know they produced 13 studio albums.
Do you have a favorite album?
I really like their early albums, but I was too young to appreciate them then. I have always been fond of "Abbey Road".
"Come Together" is one of my favorite tracks from that album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
That's tough I like a few of them a lot...not sure I can pick just one.
Ok, well...how about a few of your favorites?
I'd say Eleanor Rigby, In My Life and Let It Be.
I like those songs a lot, the more mellow thoughtful songs.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
I guess Nowhere Man.
Excellent choice! I should have said that one too.
The Beatles aren't one of my favorites, but some of their songs are just great.
I love the Beatles, they were so talented and have such a diverse body of work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know John Lennon from the Beatles loved cats? He had ten of them when he lived with his first wife Cynthia.
Can you imagine having ten cats? That is a lot of kitty litter.
I know, his mother had a cat named "Elvis" she was a huge Elvis fan.
Paul McCartney said, John Lennon was drunk the first time they met.
John and Paul wrote the song "Little Man" together.
They also wrote,"I Wanna Be Your Man" together.
I loved that song. Did Ringo Starr write any of their songs?
I think he wrote, "Don't Pass Me By"
I am pretty sure all of them were song writers. I know George Harrison wrote quite a few songs when the Beatles broke up.
"My Sweet Lord" was one of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like the Beatles?
Eh they're ok
OK?!
Yeah ok
You don't love their songs like Hey Jude and Yellow Submarine
Wow those are some very oddly specific songs
What I love them both!
Yeah but one's all moody and one is them on drugs.
Good point, what about Come Together?
LOVE THAT SONG
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to The Beatle's?
Not really, but they're a great band.
Can you name a favorite Beatle's song of yours?
It's before my time, but I like "Hey Jude" when I'm in the mood for that kind of thing. What about you?
They're before my time also, but I tend to like their later, more experimental sounding stuff.
You mean the trippy Sergeant Peppers type stuff?
Yeah, like Strawberry Fields and Octopuss's Garden.
What's your favorite Beatles album?
I think Abbey Road is their greatest album.
I've heard of that. Maybe I'll check it out on Spotify.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like early Beatles songs better or later Beatles songs?
What do you mean?
Well, most people consider the Sgt. Pepper album like the transition album where they went from early to later Beatles.
Oh really? I'm not sure I know that album, what songs are on it?
It's designed to sound like a live album, so it sounds really distinct.
Is Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds on that album?
Yes! I think it's the third song on that album.
Oh, nice. I love that song! It's probably one of my favorite songs by them.
So then you actually are a later Beatles fan, huh?
I guess so! I learned something new about myself today, huh?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are the Beatles even still alive today?
Yes, in fact 3 of the 4 original members are alive and thriving.
Wow, do they still perform?
They do perform, but not all together.
That's a shame.  Who is the best?
Paul McCartney has had the most illustrious solo career.
Have you ever seen him live?
Yes, it's actually incredible.  He's got a ton of energy for his age.
I heard that he's a vegetarian?
That must be where he gets all of his energy from.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best beatle?
John lennon I think without him they would never have gotten off the ground.
That may be very true, but really any group is just that a group effort.
yes, but Lennon was behind so much of the music's creation.
I do agree somewhat. But I kind of see him as the one who broke the band up.
I think that was more on Yoko.
Oh please John was a grown up man and made the choices he made for himself .
But I think he was so in love with yoko he was swayed by her and his desire to be with her always.
Perhaps. They did have that sit in at the hotel in Montreal. That was actually pretty cool.
I think that was one of the most important stands he and yoko took together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't it great that the Beatles just reissued Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?
I heard about it has something to do with the album's 50th anniversary right?
Yeah, they made a regular reissue, a double-cd version, and a super deluxe edition.
What comes in the super deluxe edition?
It has a total of four CDs, a blu-ray, a DVD, a book, and some other collectible inserts.
Sounds awesome!
It's so cool to hear demos and alternate versions of some of their classics, especially "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "A Day in the Life".
Wait a minute, "Strawberry Fields" wasn't on Sgt. Pepper's originally.
Several takes were included on one of the bonus discs for this collection, since the song was recorded during the same sessions.
That makes sense - I'll have to pick up a copy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Rubber soul is a unique album
Was that a less popular album
Yeah it did not catch on later on as much as the others did
I mean some tracks did though
Yeah but i mean the album as a whole compared to the others
Yeah i see that
I just love the way the songs are written it is different
They did have something special about them
Oh most definitely they did
I am sad their will never be more
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to the Beatles ever?
On occasion.
What album do you like best?
The red album.
What song from that?
All my Loving.
I actually have not heard that.
You probably have, just didn't know the name of it.
Very true.
Anyways nice talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles song and why?
I say Eleanor Rigby, it had such an interesting sound.
I did think that song is one of the best. Such moving lyrics.
Lyrics yes but also the violins and string section of that song was impactful.
Really a different take on the typical beatles sound. I think they were great in so many areas.
what do you mean areas like lyrics, instrumentals or what?
I mean in terms of having so many different sounds and styles yet they all feel like true to the band.
Well the band was around so many years makes sense their sound would change to.
Yes they just really have a big span, they started kind of do-op sounding in a way, then rock , a more spiritual indian sound emerged at one point.
They have had a very diverse career soundwise. I enjoy it all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you help me find a good George Harrison song in The Beatles?
Yes. Here Comes the Sun
That's a good one
While My Guitar Gently Weeps is another great one.
I will listen to those.
He is an underrated Beatle.
I agree. He did not get the same attention the others did.
He has a great voice.
I agree. He makes the Beatles great.
I found another song he sings! Long, Long, Long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your opinion on the Beatles white album?
I love it. It's a masterpiece.
It sure is. It came out when I was a freshman in high school.
I bought it right away.
I think it's one of their best.
Lots of oddball songs,and their only double album.
Some great stuff on there.
Another timeless Beatles album.
They all seem to be timeless don't they?
You got that right brother
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read yesterday was the 50th anniversay of the Beatle's song "All You Need Is Love."
Wow, that was a long time ago. It makes you realize how fast time flies.
"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is also having a 50th anniversary.
I think even more people relate to that because it was in a movie in the 70s.
Oh yes, I remember that. The Gibb brothers were awesome.
I think they are great singers, and I liked this better than their disco.
The disco was kind of funny, but I liked this movie because of this really great song, Strawberry Fields Forever.
That song gave me chills when they sang it.
I know, I think I had a few tears during that.
It's no wonder people still like the Beatle's music after 50 years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can we agree that the White Album is the best Beatles album.
I'm partial to Revolver and Rubber Soul.
Ok - but name your top 5 songs from the White Album.
Dear Prudence; Helter Skelter; Blackbird; I'm So Tired; While My Guitar Gently Weeps
What about Julia
Also good
What about "Happiness is a Warm Gun"
I've never been a fan of that song - seems like a bunch of unrelated material jammed together.
Are any of these your favorite Beatles song?
No - that would have to be "Strawberry Fields Forever"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yes, I grew up listening to the Beatles.
How old were you when you first heard them?
I was four years old.
That's really young.
Meet the Beatles had just been released and my older sister had a copy of it.
What's the first song you remember?
I Want to Hold Your Hand was the first one, I think.
Did you ever see them perform?
I saw them on Ed Sulivan, and later on the Smothers Brothers show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about the Beatles?
I think they're one of the icons in the music industry.
it's amazing to see in some videos, when they performed some many years ago, the stage was pretty bare, unlike performers we see today.
I agree and their songs are very simple. You know the well known ones like Yesterday, Hey Jude and many others.
I thought it's cool that the movie That Thing You do, the song was made to sound like Beatles' at least in my opinion they do.
I can't remember which song but I know the song was so short, like maybe only two minutes when maybe Paul or John were recording in the studio they tried to add stuff to the intro, play a bit of harmonica solo or something to lengthen the song enough to be recorded.
Wow yeah i can't remember what song it was but i remember reading about it too.
I like McCartney even collaborated with modern artist like Michael Jackson.
Yeah i like that one duet they did together. What song was it?
The girl is mine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking the other day about Beatles music and a discussion between my husband and my son from a previous marriage.
What in particular sticks out about the conversation?
Well it was probably 12 years ago and my husband was trying to help my son become a better guitar player.. He suggested that he learn some Beatles tunes..
Yeah i can see why he would suggest them.
Well surprisingly my son said he didn't like the Beatles. Well we were both quite surprised by his reply.
Did he say why he didn't like them? Or who he did like?
I really don't recall his answer. However it was probably because he likes heavy metal and that was too light for him I suppose.
The Beatles were and are one of my favorite go to bands.
Yeah i can't imagine someone not liking The Beatles. Well some songs I could take or leave.
Give me an example of a song you don't like. Any album of your choosing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Dad, remember when you used to tell me to "turn that garbage off" when I was listening to the Beatles?
Yeah, why do you ask?
Well, I just noticed you singing along to "Elenore Rigby" on the classic-rock radio.
So?
Well, "Elenore Rigby" is a Beatles song.
It is?
Yeah. It was in their movie Yellow Submarine, way back in the mid-sixtys. I was in high school then and you hated everything I listened to.
Well, it sounds so much better than anything else being played now, I guess I've kind of gotten used to it.
Come on Dad, admit it. You've more than just "gotten used to it." You've actually learned to like the song.
Okay, I'll admit it. Just don't tell your Mother. She still says no music worth listening to has been released since 1955.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles used to be my favorite group.
How old are you--I hardly know any of their songs, they're so long ago.
Yeh, probably the greatest group of all time and you don't even know them.  Can you name them?
Actually I can--John Lennon,  Paul McCartney, George Harrison,  and Ringo Starr.
Very good, you don't know their songs, but you know their names--how come?
Read it it my high school history book.
Very funny young man--maybe you should listen to the Beatles once in awhile instead of that rap stuff.
Not too likely but what would you suggest.
Maybe something from their psychedelic period like Strawberry Fields or Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Psychedelic?  Interesting, but I have to run.  Tell me about it some other day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Norwegian Wood is my favorite Haruki Murakami novel.
Does it have anything to do with the Beatles song?
Sort of! Only when it was translated into Japanese, there was a translation error.
What kind of error?
Well, you know how in the song, Norwegian wood is a building material?
Right, it's talking about how a particular kind of girl has a room made with it.
Well, when it was translated into Japanese, they thought it meant forest.
Oh no. That's a big error.
It's kind of understandable though. Anyway, the novel has all these long passages about being alone in a forest...
But that's not what the song's about at all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
This is a random question but did you ever listen to music from the 50's and 60's? You know, groups like The Beach Boys and The Beatles?
I listen to those artists all the time!  My favorite group was the Beatles.  Did you have a favorite song?
They had so many hits, where do I start?!  If I was forced to choose one I'd have to say 'I saw her standing there."
That's a good song! They really don't make music like that anymore do they?  The lyrics were so meaningful.
Did you have a favorite songs by them?
Yes, my all time favorite was 8 Days a Week.
That was in my Top 5!  Wouldn't it be cool if there was a group like that day?
That would be awesome!
I know a couple of them are still alive-- Isn't Paul McCartney still going on tour?
I think he is.  I wonder if he plays Beatles songs or if he mostly focuses on his newer stuff?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you listening to the Beatles again?
When am I not listening to the Beatles?
Good point. I like their music, but never really understood the hype.
They had class and talent.
Sure, don't get me wrong I like them, Yellow Sub and Sergent Pepper's are both great.
Those are the most popular, but they have a lot of more technical songs that are better.
Really? Do you think they achieved such stardom because of all the controversy and the untimely dying.
Well, the music industry loves a good controversy and artists are always more popular after they die.
So, John Lennon wouldn't be as much of a legend if he were alive.
Maybe, but Paul McCartney is still a legend and he is alive. So they are just that good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Jerry, I bet you will never guess what my first words were.
You mean the very first thing you learned to say when you were a child?
That's right. My first words.
Probably something like, "More pizza please!"
No. really! What do you think were my first words?
I don't know. Maybe you said, "Do they have these baby booties in plaid?""
Stop goofing around! Make a serious guess.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll guess
That's right! I sang the lyrics from the Beatles song, "She Loves You."
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah. She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was watching peoples' YouTube videos about their Top 5 Beatles albums, and guess which great one was not on one single list?
I know, because I've done it, too -- Magical Myster Tour.
It totally blows my mind.
Me, too.  It's like, it's got I am the Walrus, Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, Your MOther Should Know, All You Need is Love. I mean, it's crazy!
I know -- people don't think of it as a Beatles release, maybe, but more of a soundtrack.
Well, it's not. At the time it was THE Beatles release that year. You weren't getting nothing else for at least a year. That WAS the release!
And, holy cow, what a release. It's like a greatest hits unto itself.
I agree. I think the movie kind of overtakes it in peoples' minds.
People need to just step back and listen to it as an album.
I totally agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i forgot how good the beatles are
they rock i love them
i found a place where i can get my groove on to there music

they made several songs with john lennon
yea i know i forgot the name of the song i gotta look it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the Beatles stop touring?
In 1966 America.
Why did they stop?
They couldn`t hear themselves play because of screaming fans,plus this led to them concentrating on studio albums.
What was they last place they played in America?
August,29 1966 Candlestick Stadium San Francisco,CA
How long ago was that?
That was over 50 years ago my friend.
I heard the ticket stubs for these concerts are collectors items?
Yes,they are highly valued. People collect them llike coins,baseball cards and comic books. The Shea Stadium tickets seem to be the most popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles formed in 1960, but what city?
Liverpool
What's the first song of their do you remember hearing?
She Loves You, Ya, Ya,Ya and I was with my dad at the time.
Was there a favorite Beatle movie, if so, which one and why.
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band.......the story and acting was horrible but the MUSIc/SONGS
A lot of people think Ringo Starr was the first and in some cases the only drummer, but he actually didn't join until???? And for your chance to be queen for a day, who was the very first drummer?
Ringo was The Beatles drummer 1962-1970.  The very first drummer was: Tommy Moore.
The Beatles had another name before becoming The Beatles, what was it?
The Silver Beatles
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's a Beatle's Tribute band that's celebrating their tenth anniversay.
Wow, they must be really good to last that long.
They all have regular jobs, but they play 90 shows every year.
Where are they from?
Detroit. They have a website with their upcoming dates.
I wonder if it's all really old people at their shows.
I think it said they actually get a lot of young people at their shows.
They probably have heard their parents and other people talk about the Beatles, and want to get to see what the music was like.
The band is really professional. They studied the songs, and use Beatle's costumes and instruments.
They must be pretty good to still be playing ten years later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to talk about Beatles movies today.
What do you want to know?
How many Beatles movies was there?
There were 5.
Can you name them?
A Hard Day's Night,Help,Magical Mystery Tour,Yellow Submarine, and Let it Be.
What was your favorite of those five?
A Hard Day's Night because they were young and fresh.
What one was your least favorite?
Let it Be because they were at the end as old and tired.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the music of the Beatles?
Yes, I do like them a lot!
Who is your favorite Beatle?
I like John the best.
Oh, do you like him most in the Beatles or his solo projects?
I like his Beatles music best, but I do like his solo albums too.
What is your favorite song with John singing?
Happiness is a Warm Gun! Who is your favorite Beatle?
I like both John and Paul, although John probably wins.
That is cool. We share a favorite Beatle!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to do a beatles party
Huh what
Like a party with beatles music
Any other ideas to the theme
Keep it 60s centered
Well that could be interesting
I know it would be wonderful
Any album you want to play
Yellow sub all night long
Sounds good to me
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, guess this one. "Help! I need somebody. Help! Not just anybody."
"Help!" by The Beatles.
You got it. Do you like this song?
I'm a huge Beatles fan and this is one of my favorite early Beatles songs.
I know, such a great Lennon and McCartney collaboration.
Yes, and it's all about how we're not all really completely independent.
Yes, it's about how we need each other. Humans are social animals.
Exactly, I respect that. There's a lot of egotism in contemporary music.
Right, I like that the Beatles were able to right a song that's about self-doubt and needing others.
I wonder if that type of song will crop up again eventually. Hip hop is currently dominant and the boast is such a staple of the form.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Beatle?
Oh, tough one. These days it's Paul.
Really? I had you pegged as a Lennon gal.
Yeah, I used to be growing up, but now I find Lennon too serious at times.
Ah, I love Lennon. He's my favorite.
He is great, don't get me wrong, but no one can touch Paul's melodies.
I think I read an interview with Bob Dylan once where he said Paul is the best melody writer of all time.
That's extremely high praise!
Yeah, it is, coming from one of the best lyricists of all time.
Yup! My full ranking is this Paul then George then John then Ringo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the song "Revolution?"
The Beatles song?
Yeah, that's it!
Yeah, do you remember in the 90s when there was a big commotion about it?
Wait, what happened?
I think Yoko Ono gave Nike the rights to use the song in a commercial.
So what was wrong with that?
Well, people were kind of annoyed that Lennon was talking about this great Revolution, then it's used for a sneaker commercial.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, and then Heaven's Gate happened with Nike.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Beatles?
Best Rock band of all time.
Really? Better than Zeppelin, the Stones, Floyd, everyone?
Absolutely, no question in my mind.
What makes you say that?
They had so much impact on the music world - big bands today still try to copy their influence.
I suppose that's true.
Also their sound varied so much over time?
How so? Like different genres.
More styles - the difference between say, Meet the Beatles and Sgt. Pepper's is undeniable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever hear Sgt. Pepper's Band?
Yeah, that was a weird song.
It's catchy though.
I guess it kind of is.
Yeah, with all the instruments.
Kind of has a marching band feel.
I guess that's what they were going for though.
Well, I'm sure it was.
I guess.  That's what they look like on the album cover.
Yeah, that's a weird album cover.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
All the time! The music of the past is so much better than today.
I have to agree.  What is your favorite song by the Beatles?
I like "Yellow Submarine."
I do too.  That is a classic.
What else do you listen to?
I love the song, "Love!"
"All you need is Love"
Yes!  They really made some great songs.
They sure did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would the Beatles still be around today?
I think they would still be touring if they were all alive.
I dont know people would sour on them
People still attend Rolling Stones concerts.
I find the Beatles can be somewhat annoying.
How so?
People give them too much reverance.
Well Sergeant Peppers was such a good album.
I think it was good but not that good.
No way it was a landmark album
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you know who the Beatles are?
Yeah of course.
What are some of the songs you like from them?
I like Hey Jude a lot.
That is a great song.
What songs do you like?
I like Yesterday and Helter Skelter.
I don't think I've heard Helter Skelter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My first record purchase was a single of Let It Be
45 rpm right?
Yep, I think I paid a dollar.
That was big money in those days.
My sister had a portable player and we'd listen over and over.
Great entertainment.
The Beatles were the best of all time.
I agree.
I also like the Stones.
Who doesn't?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Beatles so much! Do you like them?
I love them!
What's your favorite song?
I love Hey Jude.
That one is really good.
Yeah. It makes me feel better on a bad day.
My favorite is Yellow Submarine.
Who is your favorite Beatle?
Mine is John!
I love Paul.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite band is The Beatles.
Why do you like them?
I grew up listening to their music with my dad.
My dad never listened to The Beatles, but he likes Paul McCartney's solo music.
My dad listened to them all the time. He named me after the song Michelle, My Belle.
They use a lot of girls' names in their songs.
Lovely Rita, Dear Prudence, Julia, Lucy in the Sky with Diamond... the list goes on and on.
My favorite was Lady Madonna.
I like Hey Jude.
I think Jude was supposed to be John Lennon's son, though, which isn't a girls' name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite song from Sgt. Pepper?
I'm not really familiar with that album. What's its most popular song?
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Oh yeah! I know that one. Elton John did a good cover a that song.
Well I prefer the original version better, but Elton's version is pretty good too.
I heard that the album was re-released recently.
Yes. It's a 2 CD version of the album; one of the CDs has alternate versions of the songs.
Are you going to buy it?
I'm not sure; I'd like to listen to a few of the alternate takes first and then decide whether to buy it or not.
That's a good idea, because the CDs are probably over twenty dollars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i like the song let it be by the beatles
me to thats one of my favorite songs bye them
do you have alot of albums that they made
yeah a few i listen them alot so i got plenty albums
they make me feel good and free when i listen to there music

i agree my mom use to play them alot when i was younger
what a nice why to spend your time listen to them oldies
the beatles are the greatest band in the world
i agree i love hey jude it's another one of my favorites by them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles' music is just timeless.
Oh I totally agree with that.
They're relevant even today.
What do you think was their most powerful song?
"I Want to Hold Your Hand."
What makes you choose that one?
It was probably the start of Beatles-mania in the U.S.  It was the first number 1 hit in the U.S.
I did not know that.  But I do really love that song too.
During their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, they played that song, and the rest is history.
That was over 50 years ago, but still so good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite musicals of all time was, West Side Story.
What was that about?
You never saw it?
No.
It was about this white guy, who fell in love with a Puerto Rican chic.
Doesn't sound like much of a musical.
It was set during the fifties, and the guy was a gang member in an all-white gang. The girl was sister of a rival gang leader.
Sounds like the typical Romeo and Juliet story.
Yeah, except with singing and dancing.
Nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My mom once thought that Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds was an Elton John song.
Really?
Yeah, turns out he did a cover version that I hadn't known about. I had said it was a Beatles song. We were both right, in a way.
That's funny!
So do you have any good stories about Beatles songs?
Yeah. I made a friend on this online game. He sent me Here Today. It was cool. We lost touch because he got busy with college.
Do you miss him?
Yeah, he was going to teach me his native language.
Sorry about that.
It's okay, it was a long time ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was Paul McCarthey’s wife name?
Paul wife was named Linda.
Who played drums on the Beatles song “Come Together?”
Paul McCarthy was the drummer for the Beatles.
No he wasn’t  the official drummer.
Then who played drums for the group?
Ringo Starr was the official drummer for the Beatles.
Name the iconic place that the Beatles wrote a song about and thousands of Beatle fans have taken pictures while crossing a famous street.
That is an easy one. The answer is Penny Lane.
You're pretty good at this so the next round of Beatles trivia questions is going challenge your mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Beatles?
They're not my favorite band, or my favorite type of genre, but music today wouldn't be the same without them.
Agreed completely - there wouldn't even be the same types of music if they weren't around.
What's your favorite song?
I think Hey Jude or Yesterday, which are the classics, but really any of their top songs are great. What about you?
I think Eleanor Rigby might be my favorite.
That is a classic. Have you seen Paul McCartney or any of them in concert since they stopped the Beatles?
No, it would be a classic one to go to, but I have not.
I think that's one of my all time dreams would be to go back in time and be able to see the beatles live.
I agree completely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
I like some of their songs.
What's your favorite?
I don't know.
Do you like the Sgt. Pepper's album?
Yeah, I guess.
Whenever I think of them, I think of that album.
I haven't heard it for years.
Yeah, they're ancient history now. Makes me feel old.
Ugh!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you heard of the beatles?
Of course, they are legendary!
Really? Would you consider yourself a fan of them?
Yeah, but mostly their early stuff. I love that old rock sound.
What about their later stuff and solo songs?
It doesn't hit me much. I did like Imagine though
Yeah, it's such a sweet and mellow tune. I love it too!
Whats your favorite song
I would have to say Hey Jude
Yeah, that one is popular too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Doc, I have a terrible ringing in my ears. Can you help me?
It depends...
It depends on what?
Well, you have to understand that the human condition is complicated.
Yeah...
And health is a delicate balance between strength and weakness, light and dark, and joy and sorrow.
What are you saying Doc?
I can't help you unless you take those headphones off.
Oh, sure! Hey, it stopped!
What were you listening to, "Ring My Bell" by the Anita Ward?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw A Hard Day's Night on TV. I had forgotten how many good songs where in it.
What is on that album. I forgot.
Well there is the title song obviously, but also "I Should Have Known Better".
Okay, what else?
I'm Happy Just to Dance with You and This Boy.
This Boy? What's that?
That is the Ringo's theme from the  movie.
I don't remember that one.
It's on the Hard Day's Night album in North America, but not in the United Kingdom.
Okay, maybe I should stream it and see if I remember it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's crazy?
What?
I was always a Beatles fan but I never knew it.
How's that?
I always associated The Beatles with songs like Hard Day's Night or I Love You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. But then I discovered how many of my favorite songs are Beatles songs.
Their catalogue is huge!
Yeah, like Eleanor Rigby, Revolution, Strawberry Fields, Blackbirds. So many great songs.
Right! And it's great when you get into their full albums, like Magical Mystery Tour or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
Here Comes the Sun. I love that one.
Me too! I could fall asleep to that song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what is your favorite Beatles song?
I want to Hold Your Hand
Any reason why?
Oh yes, when my mom had me as baby about a month old they sang the song on TV and she was holding me and dancing to it
Wow how special! What other songs?
Hey Jude
I like that one too! Any others?
In my life!
I love that one too!
They are one great band! So sad what happened to John Lennon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We were riding in the car with some young people and Come Together by Aerosmith came on the radio.  I like that, but I really prefer the original by the Beatles.
The Beatles?  Isn't that the band Paul McCartney was in before Wings?
Um, yeah.  If it hadn't been for the Beatles no one would have ever heard of Paul McCartney. He and John Lennon wrote most of their songs, too.
John Lennon - didn't he get shot?
Yeah, an obsessed fan shot him in front of his apartment building. That was a dark day.
So after the Beatles, did John Lennon do anything?
He did some albums with his wife, Yoko Ono. Probably the biggest hit was Beautiful Boy, written for his son.
Oh yeah.  I think I remember his son coming out and doing an album, too.
No, that was Julien Lennon.  He was John's son by his first wife and John wasn't really part of his life. Beautiful Boy was written for Sean, who was Yoko Ono's son with John.
Oh, okay. I guess I didn't know that much about the Beatles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the White Album?
I consider it their greatest album and ny favorite.
Are the Beatles the greatest group of all time?
Considering that they changed the world of music, I would say yes.
Should Paul and Ringo get together on a new album?
They probably won't but the world would welcome it.
The Abbey Road album has that iconic picture of the lads crossing the street.  Your thoughts?
I'm not impressed with it. I mean, they're just walking across the street. No big deal.
What was going on with Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds?
I think they really were tripping on LSD when they wrote that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I always heard there was a fifth Beatle
George Martin was their producer, and he has been called the fifth Beatle because of his active participation with their recordings
What did he do?
For one thing he played the piano and the harmonium in the Sargent Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band album
Was he involved with the classical music that was used like in the songs Yesterday and Eleanor Rigby?
He didn't play an instrument, but he conductor the orchestra
Sargent Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band sure had some different sounding music.  I remember when I first heard it I thought it was a very new sound
The band wanted to try something new.  They recorded the sounds of as many calliopes as they could.  Then they split the tape into one second portions and put them back together in random order.  That is the first time that had been done
I wonder who thought of that up?
John Lennon thought it up, but George Martin was the genius in making it work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The best part of those Rocky movies was the music!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah! First, you got the theme from Rocky, which everyone sings.
"Gonna fly now. Flying high now..."
That's right!  And then you got, "Eye of the tiger."
"It's the eye of the tiger."
And "Living in America..."
Yeah! Hey, what about Bealtles music?
I don't think so...Not unless Rocky's girlfriend was Penny Lane...
Or one of "All the lonely people."
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beattles song?
Honestly, I know it's corny, but I like I want to hold your hand.
Yeah, it's sweet.  I like Lady Madonna.
Which one is that?
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast, wonder how you'll feed the reast.
I also like Penny Lane.
That's a good one. The music is great on that one.
What about In My Life?
It's a little slow for me.  But I don't like the White Album that much.
Me either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know a lot about The Beatles, right?
I know a bit. I'm no expert.
What's their longest album?
The White Album for sure. It's a double album.
What do you make of it?
It has some of my favorite Beatles songs of all time, like Revolution, Glass Onion, Happiness is a Warm Gun, and more!
Oh, I recognize Revolution! That's a really good one.
Yeah, one of my favorites for sure. The White Album does have a lot of great songs, but also a bit of filler.
Oh yeah, like what?
There is a song called Revolution Number 9 which is super avant garde and long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here's a good icebreaker: What's your favorite Beatles song?
OMG. I love them all. I couldn't name just one.
But if you had to, what would it be?
Well, I really like "Hey Jude".
Oh, that's a great one. Mine is "Yesterday".
That's almost a standard. Definitely a classic.
Yeah, I tend to like Paul's songs more than the others. Paul McCartney is a genius songwriter.
He sure is. I think he got the short end of things when compositions were credited always as "Lennon/McCartney".
I agree. Another favorite song of mine is "Penny Lane".
That has Paul McCartney written all over it. Great choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have an unpopular opinion about the Beatles.
What is it?
I think they are one of the most overrated groups of all time.
Well, it might surprise you, but I agree with you.
Their early stuff is good, solid early 1960s rock-and-roll--I want to hold your hand, She loves You--
--twist and shout, Love Me Do--
Exactly. And then a few years later, it gets more complex but takes on a melancholy I can't stand, and it's not really rock--
You mean like Eleanor Rigby?
Yep. And then within a few years of starting they're putting out nonsense like I am the Walrus.
And then "Revolution Number 9." Garbage.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you listening to the Beatles?
Yes, I'm listening to Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.
It's weird how they completely changed their style.
I know, they used to be a pretty standard pop band, but everyone loved them. They really changed significantly.
It seemed like some of their songs were a protest.
Revolution comes to mind, Taxman seems to be another one.
They weren't too happy about being taxed on their wealth, I guess.
I guess not. You mentioned Revolution, have you ever heard Revolution 9?
Yeah, what a strange, strange song.
Sometimes I really wonder what they were thinking when they made that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Their debut album please please me was released by Parlophone which was founded in Germany, actually
Yep, it started in the great britain as a jazz label in 1920s
Kinda funny how that's now EMI
Well, companies merge all the time. But EMI's label manager George MArtin is the one who signed the Beatles.
You know what they shold've done?
What theyshould've done... about... what?
They shold've released "I saw her standing there" as the single.
I was gonna say "Love me do," but ok.
That's good too, but "Please please me" is ranked lower than "I saw her standing there"
Rolling stones rankings meaningless. It's a popularity contest. That's all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've never seen this album before.
It's called "Love Songs", it came out in 1977.
Can you get this on CD?
No, it's never been released on CD?
I bet it's worth a lot of money.
Not really, I only paid ten dollars for that copy about seven years ago. Maybe in twenty or thirty years it will be worth a lot.
Are the records in good condition or do they skip a lot?
They're in good condition, and I really don't play that album a lot. I already have all those songs on my MP3 player.
Do you mind if we listen to it now?
No, we have time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my friends went to a Billy Joel concert last weekend in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
Was it a good concert?
She said it was. He sang "A Day In The LIfe" from the Beatle's album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
So Billy Joel is a Beatle's fan?
She said he's a big fan. He was talking about how he just got out of high school when it came out, and it was the summer of love, and how he loved that album.
Oh, the wild sixties they tell all those stories about.
She said he talked about how that was his favorite band, and how it inspired him to become a singer too.
Billy Joel's had a long career and a lot of hits.
He's played a lot of Beatle's songs during his career she said, so his fans were happy to hear him singing something he enjoys so much.
I'm sure the Beatle's would be glad to know their music lives on with another singer. .
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Eleanor Rigby?
It's okay I suppose, but a little too out there for my tastes.
So you like the more traditional Beatles stuff?
I do indeed, I'm partial towards something like I want to hold your hand.
See that's where we differ, I get bored sometimes with their more traditional stuff.
I just feel some of their less traditional stuff was akin to them going off the deep end.
I can certainly see how it wouldn't be for everyone, and don't get me wrong I still enjoy all their stuff, at least to some extent.
Who's your favorite Beatle?
John Lennon hands down.
I'm a George Harrison person myself, also really like Ringo Star.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well, we are both old enough to have grown up with the Beatles.
Yes, I was in college when they hit it big.
"I Want to Hold Your Hand"--I thought that song was really something.
Same thing with "She Loves You"--so simple but so catchy.
Who was your favorite Beatle?
I was a Paul McCartney guy.
Not very deep, huh.
So you were a John Lennon guy, imagining no religion and the world as one.
Well, not so much at the time, but I have come to appreciate him.
Yes, I know what you mean--he had a sensitivity that I've come to admire.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the beatles?
I really them and their music as well.
Who is your favorite beatle?
Paul McCartney is my favorite. What about you?
I say Ringo Starr, I always felt he was never as appreciated as any of the others.
Ido think John and Paul certainly seemed the most popular. Poor Ringo.
Well Poor I doubt with their popularity and albums sold.
How many albums did they sell? do you have a clue?
I think it is somewhere around  800 million copies.
Wow, That is a ton! I wonder if that is the most of all time even.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was just reading this interesting article about underrated drummers in rock music.
Did it mention Ringo Starr?
It did! I have always thought he was a great drummer.
He definitely was, though I think a lot of people forget that.
Did you know that sometimes, he had to play in small cramped studios with very limited drum kits?
I did not know that! That makes his playing all the more impressive to me.
He was a good vocalist, too.
Really? I'm not sure I know any songs that he sings.
Well, he provided contributed to group vocals on several of the songs. He was the main vocalist on "A Little Help from my Friends".
Oh, that's right! I love that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many albums did The Beatles record?
They recorded 54 compilation albums, 28 studio albums, 11 video albums and 6 live albums.
Did The Beatles have any Top 10 albums?
They has quite a few including Abbey Road, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Rubber Soul.
How many Beatles songs include the name of a woman?
17 songs have the name of a woman in them including Eleanor Rigby, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and Lovely Rita.
What Beatles song spent the longest time on the charts?
Hey Jude holds the record for the longest song on the charts. It stayed there for 19 weeks.
Did The Beatles ever win a Grammy Award?
Yes they won 9 of them. Among them were for Michelle, Let It Be and Free as a Bird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Beatles rubber soul album.
Loved it. I thought it started the Beatles on their way to deeper meaning songs and started their evolution to rock,artists.
Yes,I agree.
It's a classic and starts showing John and Paul's individual talents.
It was released in 1965 right?
Yes it was.
Some personal stuff like johns Girl and Norwegian wood.
I didn't know Norwegian wood was the wood John was burning in a girls fireplace when they were in Norway.
I know,still learning things about the Beatles I never knew before
It's like it's never going to stop
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any Beatles songs you hate?
I don't know about "hate."
What about "Revolution #9?"
Well, I don't like it.
Is it your least favorite?
You know, I always hated "Penny Lane."
Really?
I don't know why. Just sounds gross to me.
So you'd rather listen to "Revolution #9" than "Penny Lane?"
I guess that's right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Beatle?
McCartney.
Why him?
Each of the Beatles was great. I just think McCartney was the greatest of them.
Why is he so great?
He's a great singer, a great musician. Do you know how many musical instruments he can play?
What about Harrison?
George Harrison was great. I was never that big of a fan when he was a Beatle. He always blended into the background. He got better after the group broke up.
And Ringo Starr?
He was a drummer. I heard him sing later on. Never liked any of his songs. Liked him in Thomas the Tank Engine though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Beattle?
It's hard to pick just one.
I like John the best.
I think I like Paul the best.
Well, I think John is the genius with the writing.
I think Paul and John were both genuises.
Who wrote Hey Jude?
Paul!
Maybe I like Paul better than.
Hah! Told you so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know a lot of Beatles songs, but I didn't grow up with them like you did. What are some interesting things about them I might not know?
Let's see, I've forgotten a lot of things--did you know they made two movies?
Really?
Yes, "Help" and a "Hard Days Night" and they weren't too bad.
Anything interesting about Ringo Starr?
Well, he was the drummer, of course, but  he was not the first--they fired some guy named Pete Best I think, who could have been famous.
Poor guy, anything else?
Well, Ringo actually had the lead on some Beatle songs, such as Act Naturally. and Yellow Submarine.
I've heard them--not classics, but not too bad.
I've never thought Ringo was that talented but he's still going.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you prefer?  The Beatles or the Stones?
Definitely the Beatles!  I grew up watching them!
When was the first time you saw them?
It was February, 1964 when they were on the Ed Sullivan Show and sang, "I Wanna Hold Your Hand".
From then on, you were hooked, right?
Absolutely.  I have been following them for decades. Every song and every controversy!
Which controversy bothered you the most?
I think when Yoko Ono was blamed for breaking up the band. What do you think? Was that her responsibility?
I think by that time, the band members were ready to go out on their own anyway.
You're probably right.  No doubt there music will live forever with such classics as "Yesterday" and "Let It Be".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles' music?
Yeah, I like some of it.
What is your favorite album?
Abbey Road is really good, what's your favorite?
Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart Band, I fell for the album's artwork before I heard any of the songs.
Yeah there are great songs on that album, Lovely Rita is my favorite.
I think Within Without You is the best song on that record.
Definitely one of their trippier album's, not like their beginnings.
The Beatles' early years remind me of boy bands of the 90's.
At least Yoko hadn't ruined the cha
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Beatle?
I don't actually know much about them.
Well, there's John, Paul, Ringo, and George!
What did each of them do?
John and Paul wrote most of the songs.
I think I knew that. What instruments did they play?
John and George played guitar. Paul played bass, and Ringo played drums!
They must have all been very good musicians!
Actually, Paul said that Ringo wasn't even the best drummer in the Beatles!
Wow, crazy that they got so popular then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Beatles album do you like best?
I'm very fond of Rubber Soul.
Is there a reason that one is your favorite?
Well, it has Drive My Car and Norwegian Wood, which are two of my favorite Beatles songs.
That makes sense. I've always liked Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band the best.
That one's also a good album.
It has so many of their most iconic songs-- Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, When I'm Sixty-Four.
Don't forget the best one!
Which one is that?
With a Little Help From my Friends!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many people are in The Beatles?
4
Cool, whoch one was married to Yoko Ono?
John Lennon
Weren't they a pop band?
They started out that way, but then became studio musicians
What is one of their hits?
Hey Jude
Is that a good song?
It's one of the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId your parents listen to the Beatles when you were growing up?
Not really. SO I didn't really grow up knowing their music.
That's a shame. It's so good!
Is it?
Yeah. I really enjoy it.
What is your favorite album?
I like their traditional stuff, but I also really like The White Album.
I actually have listened to that one -- I took a history class that used that album as social and political commentary of the time.
That's really cool!
Yeah. Maybe I should give some of their other stuff a try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the early Beatles or later Beatles?
I prefer the later music, especially the psychedelic stuff like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Yes, that's a great one. I like Strawberry Fields myself.
Oh, I forgot about that. Yellow Submarine too.
Overall, though, I tend to prefer the energy of the early songs.
Which ones are your favorites?
She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand. Have you seen any of their movies?
No. Should I?
Yes, Hard Day's Night and Help! are definitely worth checking out.
Okay, I'll do that. Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Are you a fan of the Beatles?
Yeah sure they're great.
What are some of your favorite songs?
Back in the USSR, yellow submarine, long and winding road
Those are all great.
What about you?
Lucy in the sky with diamonds is my favorite.
Love that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles Album?
I like The White Album. It is so crazy.
I like Sargent Pepper. My favorite song is A Day in the Life
Yeah, that's a good one. Is that the one with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?
Yes. I also like the older songs, like I Wanna Hold Your Hand.
What about Twist and Shout? Wasn't that in Ferris Beuller?
That's right. It's too bad they had to break up.
I would say that they're one of the best bands ever.
Maybe. Definitely the best British band.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could pick one classic band to listen to, who would it be?
Probably the Beatles.  They are timeless
I completely agree.  What was your favorite album
Hands down Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  What about you?
I'd say Yellow Submarine.  Just so many hits on that album
I think all of their albums had a ton of hits
Yeah that's true. I would love to have seen them live just once.
That would have been nice.  Sure beats most of today's music.
I think they are better than all of today's music.
You may be right honestly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello
Hi
Lets talk about music
What music
The Beatles

i do the same with my girl
they love them brown hair dudes
man who don't love the beatles
i can't tell you that cause i don't know, the beatles rock!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the music of the Beatles as a band or as individual solo artists?
I like them both but if I had to choose it would be the Beatles as a band.
Who was your favorite member of the Beatles?
My answer would be Paul McCartney. Great voice, innovative bass player, amazing songwriter who could write in so many styles.
If John Lennon had lived, do you think the Beatles would have re-united?
I do. In today's economy, they would have made hundreds of millions to do a reunion tour and with that would be an album, a dvd and so on, they would have made a fortune !
What was your favorite Beatle album?
So hard to pick one ! But you can't go wrong by owning Rubber Soul .
Have you ever seen any of the Beatles in concert?
Yes, I was lucky enough to see Paul McCartney at Fenway park. What a show !!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so excited! I just got a new shipment of vinyl records in.
Any great finds?
I think the best one is the mint edition of the White Album.
Wow, that's great! I love the Beatles, and I think that record is pretty rare.
I can't wait to hear how "Hey Jude" sounds. That's my favorite Beatles song.
It is really beautiful. So you like Paul's vocals?
Actually, I just like the song structure and lyrics. Vocally, I tend to like the songs where they all sing together.
So, their earlier stuff, like "She Loves You"?
Yes - those early songs are just so upbeat, they seem like they're having so much fun.
Their sound definitely evolved over the years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like The Beatles, right?
Of course, they're one of the best bands of all time!
I know, right? Anyway, I was just listening to Rubber Soul.
That's a great album! What's your favorite song on it?
Hmm, I would have to say "In My Life."
Yeah, that's a really great one!
What about you?
I love Nowhere Man.
The harmonies in that are excellent!
Yes! That's what I love about the song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
George Harrison is the best Beatle?
do you really think so?
i do!
why? tell me your reasoning
he was the guitarist! way better than john, too.
you're right! john's parts were really quite simple
he has a beautiful voice, and don't you love listening to his guitar gently weep?
i do!
exactly. his solos were great, his voice was great, his songs were great
too bad we had to lose him...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Beatles album did you last listen to?
That's a very specific question. Who said I listen to The Beatles?
Oh, sorry. I just assumed because you're an old white person...
You got me there! Okay, it was Let It Be
every album is just a hit, I can't even insult that choice
their later music was kind of a flop, but I enjoyed the album
What's your favorite song on it?
Two Of Us
Good choice
thanks, I thought so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yes I love them my favorite song is Love Me Do.
That is a good one. I also really like Help.
Who was your favorite Beatle?
I always loved Ringo. How about you?
I was always a big fan of Paul McCartney.
I think he is still going on tour.
I will have to go I hope he plays some old Beatles songs.
I wish we could see them all play together in the 60s.
Yes the whole Abbey Road album!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like older Beatles songs.
Like which ones?
I really like Back in the USSR.
That's an okay one.
Just okay.
The music is pretty simplistic.
Yeah but it's representative of their rivalry with The Beach Boys.
What do you mean?
It's the Beatles' version of California Girls, how they name women from different areas.
Huh, yeah that makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the way their self titled looks is bland
How is it bland
The beatles thats it
Well it is quaint
What does that word mean
Humble you know
Well humble is not always good
Neither is flashy
Why do you think i want flashy
Well it looks like it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you heard any news on the Beatles lately?
Their song, "All You Need is Love" just reached it's 50th anniversary!
Whoa! I cannot believe it's been that long! The Beatles sure are a timeless band.
That's for sure! Did you watch the newest documentary on them?
No, what's it called?
It's Called, "The Beatles: Eight Days a Week", it was released last year.
I haven't checked it out. What songs are featured in it?
It has all of their classics featured, it's considered as a documentary from when they were touring.
Who was it directed by?
The Beatles documentary I'm talking about was directed by Ron Howard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Paul McCarthy wrote and performed "Coming Up" with his wife Linda. You remember that?
Course I remember that. I also remember that John Lennon wrote "Imagine".
You ever saw footage of when the Beatles came to the states?
Yeah, they were performing on the Ed Sullivan show and they sung "She Love You Yeah Yeah Yeah."
You remember when John Lennon of the Beatles was murdered?
Yeah, it was like the world stopped. I think every radio in the world played "Let It Be" for over 24 hours.
You remember when Linda, Paul's wife died?
Yeah, I wondered how it would affect his song writing and the I remembered he wrote "And I love her."
Were you there during these incidencts or did you research this information?
Both, while researching I listened to the Beatles version of "Come Together." Superb!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the White Album is the Beatles best album?
Actually, my favorite is Rubber Soul?
Really? Why?
I think they were at their peak during Rubber Soul. George was just getting into playing the sitar with Norwegian Wood and the folk influences made it a very grounded album.
Well, I agree that Norwegian Wood was amazing, but what else was on that album?
Michelle, Drive my Car, Nowhere Man, plus a bunch of others.
I love nowhere man. It always reminded me of Bob Dylan?
Lyrically, I can see that.
I still think The White Album was better.
Well, we don't have to choose. We can listen to them all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of The Beatle's "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and the songs on that album?
I loved "I'm Fixing a Hole"...I find that it really used to echo something that I felt in my life.
Why do you say that?
I actually grew up in an old farmhouse. In my room, there was a spot on the ceiling caused by a leak, and I always wanted to fix it.
But the song was metaphorical. It was supposed to be about regrets, or something like that.
Yes, I felt like the leak was in some way my fault, having to do with my life, and things I had done and hadn't done.
And you identify with the song because of that?
Yes, I did. A lot of it also had to do with the arrangement of the song - you know, the sing-song like quality of it.
I'm not sure that I do...can you elaborate?
Well, the first part sounds like a person who is singing only to themselves. After that, it blossoms.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Beatle?
Would have to be George Harrison.
Why George and not Paul, Ringo or John?
George has such a vibrant personality.
What is you favorite Beatle song?
I would say "I wanna hold your hand."
How about a second favorite.
Next choice would be "Love, love me do."
Did you like their early work or their later work better.
I am a big fan of their early work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Beatles anthology series?
I loved it.
I remember it was on ABC and ran for maybe one night a week for a month.
It was really cool. Couldn't wait for the next week.
Yes,we learned a lot about the Beatles that we didn't know before.
I thought I knew,it all until that came out
To hear some studio cuts and,outtakes were awesome
It gave me chills.
Me too.
And two new songs
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles' song?
Ticket to Ride. I love the beat.
Oh yeah, it makes me want to dance.
It's too bad that the lyrics are kind of sad.
Yeah I know what you mean.
What is your favorite Beatles' song?
Mine is Across the Universe.
Oh wow, that one's very different.
Yeah, it's a bit more depressing.
Definitely. That song is better to listen to when I'm feeling sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite in the beatles?
Yes, my favorite one is paul mccartney
Why do you like him the best?
He writes so melodic, i love all of his melodies, singing and the guitar
Do you like him as a solo artist?
I do, but i like him in the beatles as well
What is one of your favorite songs by him?
There was a duet with him and michael jackson called the girl is mine
Would you still buy his albums?
As long as he makes one i will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Beatle?
I don't know, they were before my time so I only know the music.
Yeah, me too.  I really like their music.
Yeah, I like their later stuff more than their early stuff.
I like it all, their early stuff is fun.
Yeah, it is but Yellow Submarine and others are cool
This is true, I even like a lot of their individual stuff.
Me too, I think they all made some great music individually.
I agree.
Yeah, they were really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the song 'Hey Jude' about?
That's actually a very interesting story.  There is the actual reason, but many other interpretations.
Can you elaborate for me?
So it was originally written by Paul McCartney, directed at John Lennon's ex-wife and son.
Why did he write a song for Lennon's wife?
He did it to console and comfort her and John's son after John had his affair with Yoko Ono.
Oh that's very nice of him.
It really was.  Though due to the nature of some of the lyrics, John thought the song was for him, while others thought it was about Paul.
That is fascinating.  I guess that's the beauty of music, and the many interpretations it can have.
You're right.  And in this instance, it led to the creation of one of the Beatles' best songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think The White Album was the Beatles best record
Why do you think that?
While my guitar gently weeps was so good.
I think that was a phenomenal song but there were betters.
Like what?
Obli di Obla da for one is better.
No way that was basic.
OK then, Helter Skelter was great.
Man what a diverse album.
All of them are just like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Anna is one of my favorite songs from "Please please me."
Did you one that's it's not an original Beatles song?
Who wrote it then?
I don't recall the name of the guy who wrote it, but I do know that the Beatles didn't write it.
They used to play that song on the AM radio when I was kid.
The classic rock station that I listen to only plays songs from "Sgt. Pepper" and "Let it be", they completely ignore early Beatle songs.
I used to listen to the oldies station in Phoenix; they played songs from the early years, but they only played hits like "Help" and "Yesterday."
So you don't listen to that station anymore?
No I stopped listening to the radio a long time ago.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite album by the Beatles?
It's so hard to choose, but I think I have it narrowed down to Abbey Road and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,
Those are both great ones to choose from. I definitely like the later albums more than the earlier ones.
I agree, but I do still like listening to their early work sometimes, like Help!, for a change of pace.
True, but the music seems so much more original and stylistically developed in the later works. I like the direction John Lennon took with the songs he wrote after about 1965.
I am more partial to Paul McCartney's songs.
Don't get me wrong, he has some awesome contributions as well. I don't think they would have made it so far without his voice.
Yes, and the whole Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band concept was his idea, I believe,
Yes, I think that's true. I read an article about the origin of that album concept before.
I think it was also ranked by some magazine as the top album of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Of course! They are my favorite band.
I see, so you must have seen the movie Across the Universe that features their songs.
Of course, the whole movie is a musical featuring only songs by the Beatles.
Which songs from the movie where your favorite?
Strawberry Fields, Hey Jude, All You need is Love.
Which is your favorite singer from the Beatles and why?
It has to be John Lennon definitely, because I love the song Imagine.
What other song from them are you passionate about?
Yellow Submarine, I think is very cool and classical.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any Beatles CDs?
I have a number 1 album.
Is it good?
Yeah, it's not bad for someone getting into the Beatles.
Does it have all the good songs?
It has a lot of them, but not all.
Which ones are missing?
Well, they had tons of good music, but not all their songs were number ones.
Oh, and these are just number ones?
Yeah, so there's some songs not on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Beatles albums do you own?
I have everyone!
Haha,so do I.
Meet the Beatles was the tip of the iceberg.
Wow,ain't that the truth.
The cover with them and the cool haircuts.
God,it was great.
Wasn't it called with the Beatles in England?
Yes,I think you're right.
Same songs I believe though
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of Ringo Starr's band?
You are talking about the Beatles, right?
Well, Ringo Starr from the Beatles, but his other band.
He had a band after the Beatles?
Yeah, I think it was a play on his name.
Wait, wasn't it something like The All-Stars?
Yeah, something like that.
Why are you asking?
I was just looking for one of their albums.
Oh, I never really listened to their stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What album was the beatles last
I am not sure
Can you check
Sure thing
Thanks man
It seems let it be was their last
oh i hate the title track of that
Why
It sounds pretty bad
Well you know the band was tense with each other at the time
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, the Beatles wrote some goofy songs over the years.
Like what? I'm not that familiar with their music.
You've heard "Yellow Submarine", right?
Oh yeah, of course!
"Bungalow Bill" was pretty silly, too.
Never heard that one.
It was on The White Album, which was later in their career. That album had several goofy songs, actually.
Can you name any others?
Rocky raccoon.
I haven't heard that one either, but it sounds pretty silly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Beatles trivia?
Sure.  I've been a fan for years.
Do you know more about one member or all members of the van equally?
Probably more about John Lennon.
Me too.  He has always intrigued me.
He was the edgiest Beatle, for sure.
Do you think that was due to Yoko Ono's influence?
No, I think it was because his mom was killed when he was young.
That is a good reason for angst.
I know, right?  It permeated his music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite bands is the Beatles. Do you like them?
I absolutely love the Beatles. What's your favorite song?
I really love Good Vibrations. Have you heard it?
Yes, that’s one of my favorites! Did you see the movie about Brian?
Yes, he was brilliant and I loved seeing how he wrote it and created the whole thing.
It was amazing to get a glimpse of his genius, for sure. What other songs of theirs do you like?
Hey Jude is a great one.
I agree. I love Hey Jude! Come Together is another one I really like.
Yeah, that's a great song. I really love everything I've heard of theirs though.
Me too, it's hard to even pick a favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Beatle?
Oh, that question is as old as time!
I know. I can't say I really have one.
Me neither. Would George Martin count as an option?
I guess he could!
What about the drummer they had before Ringo. 'Pete,' somebody i think.
Good point. Technically he was a Beatle
Obviously Paul and John were equally gifted and prolific
But George wrote a ton of good stuff too.
Absolutely, He just wrote significantly less masterpieces than they did, ha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've really gotten into the Beatles lately.
Oh I love their music. Let It Be always makes me feel better when I'm upset.
Let It Be is so soothing. Have you ever seen Across the Universe.
Is that the movie about the Beatles that came out a few years ago?
Yes, it is. It is worth watching. The music is pretty good in it.
I Wanna Hold Your Hand is another favorite of mine.
I Wanna Hold Your Hand is great; I think I'd like it played at my wedding.
It is such a sweet song. What are your other favorite Beatles hits?
I also like Here Comes the Sun and Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds.
Oh, Here Comes the Sun is awesome. It reminds me of the Parent Trap movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Recently, I have been wondering if all the Beatles had survived, would they still be producing music today?
Good question. With the success off Paul McCartney, it is a good bet to think that they would have.
Do you think the group would have remained intact?
I doubt that they would have all the time, but possibly they would have come together for "reunion" tours.
That would have been something to see -- a reunion tour!  I wonder if they would have kept their original sound?
I think they would have.  I would be great to hear them together again live.
There are some imitation Beatles groups out there that do a good job imitating them.
I have seen Tribute 1964 where they sing their early songs. They open with "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" and it sounds pretty good.
I have seen that group too.  They even have the Beatles mannerisms down fairly well. "Ringo" bops his head to the music; "John" plays the harmonica.
And, "Paul" even plays a left-handed base guitar!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just read that paul mccartney didn't know he was on a rihanna song.
What he was? Like a sample?
No his guitar playing was on her track.
How does that happen?
Well I guess kanye west had reached out to work with paul. He was hesitant but did it.
so how did he not know?
Well he was working with kanye separately.  Kanye speed up his guitar track so paul did not even realize at first it was him.
Crazy, kanye seems sneaky.
A bit.Paul did not even know Rihana was going to be involved at all.
Well I had no clue he was on any song of hers. Different but interesting collaboration.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think is the most romantic beatles song?
I would pick something, by George Harrison.
That is a romantic one. Imagine if it was written about you..
ya then it turns into the ultimate love song.
I think all their wives at that time were featured in the music video.
I believe that is right. I slightly recall yoko in shorts and in a park with john.
Something like that. Smart move on their part, Happy wife Happy Life.
I don't think john lennon would agree. it seemed like the happier he and yoko were the less happy the band life got.
I wonder if yoko really was a major reason they split or if it was bound to happen no matter what.
Who can say. I am just glad we had them for as long as we did. The music is great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never realized the Beatles were from Liverpool.
I knew they were English, but never knew what area.
Yeah they played in Liverpool and Hamburg in the early 1960's.
I think they got real popular around 1963.
I guess that's when Beatlemania started
Wonder when they came to the US?
I believe that was somewhere around 1964.
I guess that was the "British Invasion"
It's such a shame Lennon was killed.
Yeah they had some really great music ahead of them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
it's late and i got the beatles tune in my head
what tune is that
i want to hold your hand
yes i love that one
yeah it's a great song
they have lots of them
i must say they do they have lots of great albums also
yeah i just download a few songs today
i think of my girl everytime i hear them
they make me think of old school days
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Beatles album cover Abbey Road?
It is one of the most iconic rock album covers ever!
Do you know there is a webcam you can google that shows Abbey Road 24/7?
Yes,when I can't sleep at night at 3:am I like to check out people in England walking on Abbey Road.
Which Beatle walked barefoot across Abbey Road?
Why it was Sir Paul McCartney!
Has there ever been a more famous walk?
Not that I can think of.
It seems the Beatles were not only great rock group,but designed great album covers as well.
Yep,the Beatles were special and we will never see their likes again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I may get some flack for saying this, but I think the Beatles are overrated.
How could you even think that?
Maybe it is because I am younger and I wasn't alive when they were at their height.  I don't know.
What is your criticism of them?
Well, I think they did make decent songs.  I guess I like my bands with a little more edge to them.
I think the Beatles were masters of taking a song that sounds clean on the surface, but it had some crazy alternative meaning.
I may have to dig deeper into their catalog.
Have you heard of the song "Helter Skelter"?
Yes, that is probably my favorite Beatles song.  It reminds me of something the Rolling Stones would do.
It sounds like you enjoy the more straightforward rock and roll songs.  That may be why you don't like some of The Beatles' work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally watched "A hard day's night" the other day.
How was it?
Well after hearing about how great it was for about 25 years I must admit I was kind of disappointed.
Why?
The movie didn't have much of a plot, but the music was awesome.
I haven't seen the movie myself. What songs do they sing?
Well, the title track of course, in fact that's at the very beginning of the movie. That I think is one of the best parts of the movie.
I've seen parts of that video; that's when all the fans are chasing them.
All of them except for Paul who is sitting on a bench in disguise reading a newspaper.
Yes I remember that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
I really love Strawberry Fields Forever.
Yeah, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is a great album.
It's hard to choose, but I think that is my favorite Beatles album.
So do you like Paul McCartney or John Lennon more as a singer?
As lyricists they are both amazing, but I'd say I prefer McCartney singing.
I can't get enough of Elenor Rigby.
That is another song that is near the top of my list.
Are you offended by all the drug references?
No, I think they all serve a greater creative purpose for the songs as a whole.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the greatest Beatles song of all time is?
I think Hey Jude is the greatest.
Why do you think Hey Jude is the greatest?
Because I like the rhythm track the best.
What about the rhythm track do you like?
I like the chord progressions.
What else do you like?
I like the way Ringo keeps time on the drums.
Do you wish the Beatles were still around today?
Yes, I do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles at all?
Yes. I like the Let It Be album.
I also enjoy that.
I love Maggie Mae on that, it is pretty.
Yeah that is a prettty mellow song.
I listen to it everyday.
Do you?
Yeah it just makes me feel good.
That is nice.
Nice talking to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Beatles music?
Oh yeah!  John and Paul are my favorites.
They are really talented.  Whats your favorite album?
It used to be Sergeant Pepper.  I used to listen to it over and over.
And now?
Well now my tastes have changed and I prefer Abbey Road.
Oooh, love that album!  The cover is cool too and the music is awesome.
Yep, someday I want to cross Abbey Road barefoot.  I love every song.
Me too.  No bad music on that album.
You got that right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of The Beatles?
Yes! I think they're an amazing band.
Cool! Do you like their earlier songs like "Help" and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand?"
Yeah, their early songs were great but I'm more a fan of their later songs. What about you?
I do like their later songs, like on their Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album, but the early songs have a special place in my heart!
What's your favorite early song of The Beatles?
I like a lot of them, actually. Eight Days a Week, I Wanna Hold Your Hand etc...
Yeah, it's hard to pick just one since they wrote so many incredible songs.
What's your favorite from their later songs?
I love Across the Universe and Eleanor Rigby -- but like you said, it's hard to pick!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles album?
It's so difficult to pick just one album!
I know, I feel like they spanned so many genres that there is something for everyone.
Agreed.  That said, I would probably say that the White Album is my favorite.
The album most people tend to choose?
Yes, but I think it truly deserves the praise.
Could you explain what you mean?
Of course!  It marked a real departure from the rest of their catalog and an evolution in their sound.
It doesn't hurt that there are multiple popular songs on that album.
Of course not.  I'd say it's almost like The Wall of the Beatles catalog because it has so many popular songs and is so iconic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
To me, it was like The Beatles changed everthing. They picked rock up and shook it, and put it down somewhere else.
Yet they had influences, of course, like anybody. They didn't just spring out of nowhere.
I know that when they were getting started, at the Star Club in Hamburg, Little Richard was playing there too.
I know when Paul McCartney was in school he idolized Little Richard.
And John praised him too. They all admired his musical daring, I imagine.
Yeah. When the Beatles were inducted into the Rock Hall of Fame Harrison said they wouldn't be there if not for Little Richard.
I heard Little Richard was there for the ceremony, and Harrison pointed at him and said, "It's all his fault, really."
Funny. But Harrison's big influence was Ravi Shankar. That's where the boys got all the sitar music.
I heard Harrison studied with him in India.
And Lennon was influenced by his poor mother, who couldn't raise him but taught him banjo and gave him a guitar.

Who is your favorite Beatles member?
That is hard! It's a debate between Paul and John.
What about George? I feel like he's underrated, his solo songs are excellent?
True, what is your favorite solo song by George Harrison?
I've Got My Mind Set On You, for sure!
Me too! What is that other religious song he sang?
My Sweet Lord, love that one too!
Yes! Now that I think about it, he's kind of an outcast from the other members in his beliefs.
He is, that's why he's my favorite.
His songs seem to have more substance than the others when they went solo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Do you know about the Beatles?
Sure of course.
Who do you think is a better guitar player John or Paul.
That's a tough question.
Yeah.
I would say Paul maybe?
I'm torn as well.
Not really sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how important the Beatles are?
What do you mean?
Many great bands today credit the Beatles for their success.
Wow that does kinda make sense.
Yes the Beatles really laid the foundation for success.
Yes they showed what a great band is.
Yes they put a good template out there for others to use.
Yes they did a great job, they are unforgettable.
Yes we all owe them a lot for being pioneers.
Yes they are so special.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Beatle is your favorite?
John Lennon.
Why is John Lennon your favorite?
The songs he wrote while in the Beatles are some of my favorites. I also think his music after the Beatles was better than the other Beatles music after they broke up.
What is your favorite John Lennon song?
Jealous Guy
What is your favorite Beatles album and why?
The White Album because it has such an eclectic mix of music not really arranged as an album. Most albums from that time period had songs that belonged together.
Do you think Yoko really broke up the band?
Yes and no. I think the band was ready to break up. We all know that Yoko had influence over John who was really the one who wanted to end the Beatles, not Paul as reported.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recommend me a good Beatles song?
It depends, what kind of music do you like?
Isn't it all rock?
Well there is the 50's rock beatles, but there is also a more mellow sound they started making in the 60s
I guess I would consider myself a fan of 50s rock
Well then I would recommend the sock Help
I've heard that song and its good! Any other recommendations?
I want to hold your hand is also a classic
Cool I'll have a listen
You should broaden your horizons and listen to their 60s stuff
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey man
What are you doing
Just listening to some tunes
What tunes
I am listening to some beatles
What album
My favorite of course
Whats that one
Twist and shout their best one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the Beatles?
Oh yea, they were great. I really loved John Lennon
Yea, me too. What was your favorite album The Beatles made?
I absolutely loved "Revolver". It was one of their first albums.
Yes, that was a long time ago. What songs can you remember?
I remember "taxman, tomorrow never comes and doctor roberts. They were my favorites from that album.
What happened to The Beatles ? Why did they break up?
I think it was when John Lennon was shot dead in New York.
Oh yea, that is right . I was very sad , he was such a peaceful person.
Yes, me too. I can't believe someone would do that to such a peaceful man with a message of love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know much about the Beatles?
I know that they were a band.
Do you know which members died?
Oh, yeah, there were two of them.
Which of them were they?
John died first.  Then George died more recently.
Okay, so who's left.
That leaves Ringo and Paul.
They never tried to get back together?
No, I don't think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles' experimental phase?
Yes, I like all their psychodaelic music.
Me too, I really like when George Harrison played the sitar.
He really respected Ravi Shankar, and benefitted from his influence.
I agree, and I like their sitar-songs better than their early popular stuff.
Do you enjoy the song "Within You Without You?"
Yes I do, but it goes a little deep for me.
Do you mean that you feel like you're lost in the song?
Exactly, it feels like a trance.
That's funny, I feel the same way about that song, but I embrace it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Love the Beatles.
What is your favorite album?
Revolver
Is that the one with Eleanor Rigby?
Yes, and my favorite Got To Get You Into My Life.
They are good, but my favorite is Yellow Submarine
Oh yes, and the movie was great too
It was. I love all the Beatles movies.
Me too, especially Help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow my dad just sent me this link to these guys called the Beatles
Yeah I've heard of them, all the old folks love them
They really are awazing
I guess, I remember hearing that song Paperback Writer,,,it's my mom's favortie
But they really are amazing you should check them out.  They were huge in the 1960s, you know, last century.
What's the big deal?
They were some of the first rock musicians to write and record their own songs.  Before that songwriters rarely recorded...Elvis was just a singer, not a writer so the Beatles changed the game for everybody.
Now THAT I didn't know.  I just assumed they all wrote their own music
The Beatles were pioneers to what we listen to today
I'll definitely check them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to The Beatles?
Yes I do.
Which album?
Help!
Oh that is a cool album.
I like listening to The Night Before.
I haven't heard that in so long.
I also like I Need You.
That song I love. It is so catchy.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on The Beatles?
I don't really have any thoughts. I'm indifferent to them.
You don't like any Beatles' songs?
I do like the song, "Hello Goodbye". They just have never appealed to me. I can understand the appreciation of them.
Yeah, they are one of the best bands of all time.
Baby boomers love them. I can see how they were ground breaking back in the day.
What do you mean back in the day? They're still relevant after decades.
I agree to some extent. Where do you start? I've heard all their hits and nothing really grabs me.
You should listen to Abbey Road.
Okay. I'll give it a listen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard any of the Beatles music?
Yes I own several of their records.  I got them from my mom who was an avid fan.
That's so cool.  What is your favorite record?
I really like the Sgt. Pepper album.
Me too it is on of their best.  It is amazing how they influenced music.
I know right? Just 4 guys from England who liked to jam out.
It is a shame that they had a riff and split.
Yes, but they all did go on and make some good solo music.
They sure did.  Sir Paul and Ringo are still going strong.
I hope to see Paul if he goes out on tour and comes through my area.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Beatle?
Ringo, obviously!
Wait, seriously? Or are you joking?
I'm joking - although I do love Ringo.
So who's your favorite then?
I'm going to be a contrarian and go with George Harrison, what about you?
Ah George - so underrated, I think I'd have to say Paul McCartney.
I can understand that - Hey Jude and Let it Be are two of  my favorites!
And Here Comes the Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are Two of mine!
Well then I guess we agree for the most part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the beatles
Okay, great
I was just looking at a website, they sang twist and shout?
Oh i didnt know that
Me either
I guess you do learn something new everyday
I guess so
Im going to listen to that song now
Me too
Bye
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Beatle.
I always liked Ringo the best for some reason.
How can you like the drummer the best?
He sang a few songs, and they were pretty good.
Really, like what?
Yellow Submarine for one.
Oh, yeah I forgot about that one. It is pretty catchy.
Yeah, also With a Little Help From My friends
Did he write songs, too?
Yes, I know he wrote Octopus's Garden.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the song "Strawberry Fields"?
Yes, I like that song, I also like the fact that part of Central Park is named that in Honor of John Lennon
Another great song is Paul's "yesterday".
I like George Harrison's"My Guitar gently weeps"
yeah another great one is Lennon's "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
yes, and I like the Song "Yellow Submarine" by Ringo Starr
I like the Abbey Road Album.
I think that is the Best Album that the Beatles made
I also like Elinor Rigby
Yes, i especially like the Lyric " Father Mackenzie wipes the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, do you listen to the Beatles?
Yeah, sometimes I do.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
"I wanna hold your hand"
I like that song too.
I have a bunch of their old records at home.
Wow, that's awesome.
Yeah, maybe I will show you later, if I have time.
This is going to be cool.
Yeah, I have all their albums right here at home. My parents have been collecting Beatles albums for years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the beatles?
The beatles, you mean the supergroup from the 60s?
Yeah, thats them. So, you like em?
They were never my bad. Too british.
Too british eh, what do you prefer?
Lady gaga is my cup of tea I would say.
Really now. You'd take modern pop over sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band?
Any day of the week.
You are hopeless.
I do what I want!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Beatles' music?
Oh yeah, I love the Beatles. What's your favorite album?
I can't really decide, but I really like Let It Be. It has so many good songs that people ignore.
Like which songs? The title track is pretty popular, I know
I Me Mine is one of George's better songs, and it's on Let It Be
I like that one. Get Back is another one of those classic songs that you don't hear enough of nowadays
Don't Let Me Down is a great song, but they didn't include it on the album originally
Why's that? I really like that song, too
I think it had something to do with their producer, Phil Specter
I heard about that. I'm just glad the other songs got released so we could enjoy them as they were originally arranged.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about music
Great i love music
Me too
What older band do you like
Definitely the beatles
I love them
Their songs are so catchy and mostly upbeat
Yes they are
Well nice talking to you
You too

Do you like the beatles
Yes
Me too
They are good artists
Where are they from?
Liverpool
Oh okay,  i thought england
They have cool accents
And it shows through in their songs
Yes it does
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you're a big Beatles fan, right?
Yeah, I like a lot of their stuff.
Cool, I was reading some trivia the other day and thought it might interesting you.
Lay it on me, although, I might already know it... hehe.
Okay.. check, the song "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" a lot of people think is about drugs, but one it's actually based on a picture Lennon's son drew at like age four or so of his classmates.  They were like, "What is this?" And he said, "That's Lucy!  She's in the sky with diamonds!"
Yes, I've heard that.  That was Lennon's son Julian, actually.  Supposedly, he inspired two other Beatles songs.
Oh, really? Which ones?
I believe "Hey Jude" and "Good Night."
Oh, that's neat!
Yeah, sadly, John and Julian's mother got divorced when the boy was five. After that, Julian says John didn't have much contact with him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the beatles
Okay great
I wish they were still around today
I kmow me too
We need more bands like them
The 60s had way better music
They definitely did
I wish i was born in that era
That would have been awesome
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatle's album Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?
It's one of my favorites by them
Do you have a favorite song on that album?
Hard to pick but I still know all the lyrics to Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds.
Yeah, I memorized that entire album-I thought She's Leaving Home was a beautiful song.
I agree but there are just so many good songs on that album.
How about When I'm 64?
I used to think that was SO old when I first listened to that Beatles song and now it's reality.
The Sargent Pepper album is 50 years old this year and is still great.
And my favorite Beatle Paul just turned 75 and I think he
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Beatles are the greatest band ever?
I really do.
What's your reasoning?
They were unbelievably innovative and their music still holds up.
Don't you think they're a bit overrated though?
Not at all, their music crosses so many genres.
Do you think anyone could top them?
I really don't know how, because there isn't much room for innovation any more.
So what's your all-time favorite Beatles song?
I would have to say the Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End meddly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Beatles Cirque show?
I haven't, no. Did you like it?
I haven't seen it either, but I bought the soundtrack.
Was it as good as the soundtrack to Across the Universe?
Yeah, it's really good. But it's hard to compare to the originals.
Well the originals are so good.
Do you have any favorite Beatles tracks?
Norwegian Wood is my all-time favorite.
I liked Sergio Mendes's cover of that one too.
I didn't even know that he covered it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like the Beatles?
Yeah I love them, and so do most of my friends
Who is your favorite member? I think mine is Paul but I haven't really made up my mind
Yeah I like Paul and John, but I think George was the most underrated, unless you count Ringo
No one ever counts Ringo, it seems like
They finally inducted him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, though, so that's cool
Yeah, I really liked Octopus's Garden that he wrote with George
That's a great song, just like Yellow Submarine, which is a classic
People don't give Ringo enough credit for his drumming, either
Oh yes, he's one of the greatest drummers of all time, no question
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Yellow submarine is a weird album
Why is it weird
Because you know just the title
But it is simple yet cool
But is it simple?
It seems to be
It could be much deeper than we think
Hmm that is an interesting thought
I know right!
Why dont we look into it
XXXXXXXXXXX
You are too young to remember the Beatles, but they are one of the greatest musicians/song writers of the modern world.
Right, but I do know many of their songs and like to listen to them.
What are some of your favorites?
I really like the quirkiness of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club album.
Yes, it was a unique album and very popular.
"Lucy in the Skies With Diamonds" is really fun to listen too.
Also, on the album is "When I'm Sixty Four".  As I have hit the 60s, I appreciate that song even more.
Do you think the Beatles were on their way out with this album?
I actually think it increased their popularity. It showed the world how versatile they were.
They did one more album after that, "Let It Be".  That's the one that seems to be their "goodbye" album. "The Long and Winding Road" kind of sums up their career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah, aren't those guys from England?
Yeah, I think so.
Why do you ask if I like them?
Because I'm a little lonely and would like for you to listen to them with me.
Okay, that would be cool.
Do you know much about them?
No, not very much.
Oh okay, I see. Maybe we can listen to their songs together sometimes.
Alright, no problem.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i like the bettles there very  cool

yeah i would have to say that there a group that would be best kept together
yeah they rock together would'nt want to see them broke up! hate that music is'nt made anymore
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could only listen to one beatles song which one would you pick?
That is tough. I would go with strawberry fields forever.
why that one?
It was one of the first psychedelic rock genre . I really adore them for those songs. I also really enjoy hearing it.
It was a lennon written one , right?
It was but seems credited to lennon-mccartney. But was about john's memories of playing in the fields.
That is interesting. I had no clue.
What about you ? which would you pick?
Help! .. because I would need help if I only could pick one of their great tunes.
Ha, that is funny.  I am certainly glad we have so many songs from them and glad we are not limited to one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Beatles?
They're okay I guess.
What do you mean they're okay?
Just what I said.  I've heard better.
What song of The Beatles do you like the most?
The only one I know is Penny Lane.
Are you sure the Beatles did that one?
I may not be crazy about them but I do know some of their songs.
I'm just messing with you that is one of my favorites too.
What's with all the questions about the Beatles anyway?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the first Beatle song you remember listening to?
I wanto hold your hand.
Is that your favorite Beatle song?
No, my all time favorite was Yesterday.
Did you every see the Beatles live?
Yes, in New York in 1964.
Who is your favorite Beatle?
John Lennon
Why was he your favorite?
Because he was so very talented and was in touch with his fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
Well, that is a very tough call. There are definitely a few that I would have difficulty choosing from.
I can understand that. Do you have a favorite member?
I'd probably have to say Paul McCartnet. I really also liked his work with Wings.
Oh, for sure. That is also great music.
John Lennon is of course a close second.
Yeah, I would even go so far as to say he is my favorite. Imagine is just one of those songs that I can never turn off.
I hear you on that one.
Sounds like we both are both big fans. Would you be interested in going to see a tribute band concert sometime?
Absolutely. Just let me know when!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles had a long and prolific career.
Yes they did.  What was your favorite song of theirs?
I think it was Hey Jude.
Why that one in particular?
Paul Mccartney wrote it for John Lennons son and i think it's sweet.
It's a shame what happened to him.
Yes he would definitely have made some more great music.
His talent was unsurpassed.
I think he would have had a lot to say about the current political situation too.
Yes he would have been mortified.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId you see that PBS special on the Beatles recordings that was on recently?
No, was it good?
It was awesome!
What kind of things did you learn?
They showed what went on in the studio. They showed lots of the recording techniques George Martin and the other engineers came up with which were very avante garde and never been done before
Did they focus on a particular album?
Yes, actually, it was mostly about the Seargeant Pepper's album
I love that one!
Me too. It's probably their best.
Yes, I agree. I just love Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved listening to the Beatles when I was younger.
Me, too.  What was your favorite song?
Oh man.... are we talking early Beatles or adult Beatles?
Both!  What about Sargeant Pepper era?
Uh no.  I'm not counting the Sargeant Pepper era!
I'd say Dol You Want to Know a Secret was my favorite early Beatles.
Oh yeah, that's a good one.  I liked that too.
Adult Beatles is harder because they did solo stuff as well.
Yep.  Sometimes it's hard to know if you're listening to a solo record or not.
Agree.  They were all so talented though, it doesn't matter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you think Beatles are one of the greatest music band ever?
totally agreed, I loved their music like crazy
me too! I know this gonna be a hard question, but which song is your favorite?
If I have to chose I think my personal favorite belongs to Let It Be
it's such a soul touching song, isn't it?
yes indeed, I always listen to this song when I'm down, it's uplifting
Agreed. Another sweet song from them is Hey Jude
oh, classic, I'm glad you like it, I remember singing it when I was in high school
yeah, some of my classmates were obsessed with that song as well
haha, everybody got a sweet secret crush
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, I love this song!
Who is it?
It's by the Beatles! It's called "Something."
Is it by Paul or John?
It's actually by George!
I didn't know he wrote any of the songs.
Yes, actually Frank Sinatra said this was his favorite Lennon/McCartney song.
That's funny! I only know their early pop songs.
What's your favorite?
I love "Love Me Do!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
How familiar are you with The Beatles?
I know a lot of their music. My parents used to play it all the time.
Do you like them?
Yes, especially the really early songs. I love "I Want to Hold Your Hand."
I like their later stuff. I think "Blackbird" might be my favorite.
That's from The White Album, right?
Yes. It has so many great songs. "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" is really beautiful.
My mom liked that one. George Harrison was her favorite Beatle.
My mother liked Paul the best.
I just saw him on a talk show. He's pretty old now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is going to be a fireworks game set to the Beatles' music after the baseball game Friday night.
Really?  I've never really been into them very much.
I know what you mean.  I am having a hard time picturing fireworks going off to their music.
It would be slow.  I guess you could do a set with Hard Day's Night.
True, or Eight Days a Week.
Those are basically the only two I can think of that are a little fast.
The main song i think of when I think of them is Yesterday.
That and Norwegian Wood.
Both of those are just way to slow and a little down.
I may not stay for the fireworks since I'll have to listen to Beatles's music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles fan?
I'm not a die-hard fan, but I do enjoy their music.
I really liked "The Yellow Submarine," both the album and the movie.
The artwork on the album cover is colorful, too. "All You Need is Love," may be my favorite from that album.
My mom told me that they put "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" on the U.S. 8-track version of that album.
I always thought that "Eleanor Rigby" tells a sad story. Poor thing, no one went to her funeral.
They wrote great stories with their lyrics.
And the music is catchy. "All Together Now" has a child-like quality about it.
I can't believe they broke up so long ago.
That's a testament to how good they were. We still listen to their music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the Beatles got started?
What do you mean?
I mean how they got famous.
How did they get famous.
Well the Beatles themselves credited their epic practice sessions.
They practiced a lot?
Yes well they were low paid gigs.
Do you have any specific examples?
They played for 12 hours each day in the beginning, at clubs, and later credited all that practice for their success.
Wow they really are a great example of what a band is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wanna hear that song "I Wanna Hold Your Hand".
Cool
Who did that song?
I'll give you a hint. They are from Liverpool.
The Beatles?
Yes.
Wow, that is a great song. I never knew who did it.
The Beatles are one of the best bands ever. They have tons of good songs.
Can you recommend another for me?
Girl. John Lennon sings that one. It is great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite line in the Beatle's song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?"
That's hard to say! I think I like the phrase "kaleidescope eyes" the most.
It's definitely beautiful imagery - and a little crazy!
For sure! What about you, what's your favorite phrase or line?
I like "looking glass tie". I always picture a mirror in the shape of a tie.
Yeah - it's almost like you could see yourself reflected in that person's heart.
Exactly. Another interesting song is "We All Live In A Yellow Submarine"
Tell me about it! Though it does have a catching rhythm.
Once my five year old sister heard and she was singing it all day long for days!
Oh no! How did you get her to stop?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Beatles?
Yes, who doesn't like them?
Who is your favorite Beatle?
I will have to say Paul McCartney, how about you?
I like John Lennon.  How about Yoko Ono, his wife, what do you think about her?
They fit together.  It worked for them.
Yeah I guess. What was your favorite Beatle song?
Let it Be, how about yours?
Elanor Rigby, but I also like Yellow Submarine.
Yes there are so many good ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first listen to the Beatles?
When I was a kid I got one of my Dad's CD's.
What album was it?
It was the white album.  I used to listen to it over and over and over.
Really?
Yes, it was something completely new to me and I really enjoyed the music.
What did you like most about it?
It was different than things I had heard before and I could understand the lyrics and loved the music.
Yes, the Beatles are great for that.  I have always loved listening to their songs.
Agreed.  The Beatles are great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Beatles music?
Yeah, of course.  Who doesn't?
Do you prefer their earlier stuff or later?
I don't know.  It depends on my mood.
I understand.  Their later stuff is much deeper.
Exactly.  If I'm in a more cheerful mood, the earlier stuff.
Yeah, that makes sense.  What's your favorite earlier stuff?
I still like "All My Loving" I think.
Yeah, that one's good.
I guess it's kind of common.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do young people still listen to the Beatles?
I think so, wasn't there a movie a few years ago?
What do you mean?
Yeah, there was a musical movie that became quite popular.
Do you remember what it was called?
Across the Universe.
Sounds vaguely familiar. It was popular you say?
Yes, very popular.
I know Across the Universe is a Beatles song, was the movie filled with Beatles songs?
Yes, but not originals. They were covered by the cast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you listening to?
A playlist I created of oldies music, right now it's the Beatles.
The Beatles? My mom loved them, I can't seem to get into their music though.
They were iconic. You don't even like "Hey Jude?"
No. What are some of their other hits?
My other favorite is "Here comes the sun."
Well, I guess that song is alright. I just don't understand why girls went so crazy over them.
My mom thought Paul McCartney was a total fox.
To each their own. It is sad about John Lennon, though.
Yes, especially because he had a young son. But he did leave quite a legacy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles are great.
Yeah, I agree.
I love all of their songs.
Every album is perfect.
I like all of their stuff. The early stuff and the late stuff.
They have a very unique sound too
Yes. There is no song like Hey Jude out there.
That song is so long and amazing.
I heard Bob Dylan influenced them.
He probably did. He was a great song writer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did The Beatles break up?
Yes. They all went solo.
Who had the best solo career.
Well, Paul had the most succesful.
What about John Lennon?
He did good too, but he was shot and then passed away.
Did Ringo go solo?
Yes.
That is cool. They were better as a group though.
That is true. They are one of the best bands ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite member of the band?
That't a tough question, either John or Paul.  Whats yours?
Probably John.
Why John?
He had the most potential, though the post Oko years were a little odd.
But he had some of his best music after he met her.
Like what?
Imagine for one!
Oh, I forgot about that!
Yes, its one of the best songs of all time!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh, I really love the Beatles. Nobody writes music like "Yesterday" anymore.
Yeah, I totally agree.So much feeling... Everytime I hear "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away..."  I get all teary-eyed.
You too?
Yeah, our parents used to complain about how the lyrics didn't make any sense. They should give a listen to the stuff that passes for music these days.
Funny, my Dad did the same thing. But now that he's 87, he actually LIKES the Beatles!  Guess NOW he's comparing them to modern music.
That's funny.  My grandkids like the Beatles more than their parent's music. I played Abbey Road for my 6 year old grand-daughter and she loved it.
Oh, Abbey Road is such a classic. How could anyone not like it?
I agree.  What's your favorite cut from Abbey Road?
That would definitely be George Harrison's "Here Comes the Sun."  You?
I prefer Lennon's "Come Together" but "Here Comes the Sun is definitely a close second for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hi there
Have you heard of the beatles?
Yes they are a classic band
I love them
Who is your favorite?
Ringo
Hes cool
Who is yours?
John lennon
XXXXXXXXXXX
How was your road trip?
Awful. My friends played The Beatles' Greatest Hits on repeat for the entire five hour drive!
How can you hate The Beatles? That's like hating American history.
The Beatles are from Liverpool.
You know what I mean. They became American Icons with the British Invasion.
That's because they marked the beginning of Rock N' Roll. There weren't as many popular groups as there are now.
So you have to admit they are one of the greatest bands in history.
No I don't. They are one of the most overrated bands in history. They're songs are so simple, just like children's songs or like someone singing in the shower.
They're alot better than today's modern day pop bands like The Backstreet Boys!
Please, my friend, they were the original Backstreet Boys!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you've heard of the Beatles, right.  What do you think of their best selling Album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?
Oh, is that the one that was a concept album about a fictional band?
Yes, that is my all time favorite Beatles Album.
Oh, really.  Mine too. And my favorite track is "With a Little Help from my Friends".
My favorite track is "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds".  What do you think of that song?
Yes, I like that one too.  But my all time favorite is "A day in the life".
Was that a Lennon and McCartney song?
Yes. In fact some claim that A Day in the Life was the best Lennon/McCartney collaboration.
I didn't I didn't know that. But  you know, there are so many excellent tracks on that album.
There sure are; and it's hard to believe that it was first released about 50 years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles album?
Oh, that's easy; it would have to be Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band:  it was such a musical breakthrough. How about you?
I, myself, like their previous record the best: Revolver.  That's where they *really* started experimenting with things.
Really? I always think of Sergeant Pepper as the first *real* concept album.
It's true Revolver wasn't a 'concept' album, but that's where they started with all the tape experimentation; faster, slower, backward...
But it all came together on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band: that's the one everyone looks to their breakthrough album.
It's still just a continuation of Revolver's experimentation. Listen, for example, to the reversed guitar on Tomorrow Never Knows.
Interesting! I've listened to Revolver, but I never thought of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as a continuation of it.
Or listen to weird musical processing they did on Yellow Submarine -- *that* was a brand-new technique at the time, too.
I'm going to listen to Revolver, then listen to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band afterwards.  This will be fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
i think I feel fien is the most underrated Beatles song ever
Eh, I don't know about that.
Ok fine then what do you say is the most underrated song
Well, for one, I feel fine is no 4 in terms of revenues generated so it can't hardly be an underrated song
Whoa, dude. I didn't know that.
it just doesn't get the air time it deserves.
So sick of yesterday
And let it be
Yep most overrated songs
Add here's comes the sun and we have the worst songs by the Beatles ever
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to the Beatles ever?
I try to listen to them often.
I like the Red Album.
Oh me too.
What song?
Can't Buy Me Love.
That is my favorite on it too!
We have so much in common.
I agree.
It was a blast talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went to this trivia night at a local bar two nights ago. It was a lot  of fun.
So did you do well? Did you win anything?
Yes our table did very well. I couldn't believe then questions about The Beatles that stumped people.
Like what? How hard could it have been?
They didn't know any of the wives names of any of them. The question was name 2 of The Beatles wives.
And not many of them knew? Or did any of them know?
No one knew except our table. These younger people don't know what music is anymore.
Let's see if I can do it. Barbara Bach, Yoko, Linda,who else?
You did well. Each of them I believe had at least two.
How could anyone forget Yoko. She was the one who was accused of breaking up the band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello.
Do you like the band the Beatles?
My mom used to listen to them, I know a few songs.
What songs do you know?
Yellow Submarine, Help.
Those are good ones.
I like them.
You know any more?
Not really, no.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so sick of people praising the beatles music
Why
Because it blows
But not really
Yes really
How so
They all suck
Never you are low man
Nah no way
Yes way
XXXXXXXXXXX
You up for a game of Beatles Trivia?
Aw this should be good because I'm the biggest Beatle Fan. Let's do this!
Okay what song is " Oooh I need your love baby."
That's all I get of a Beatles song? Okay, I got it. "Hold Me Love Me."
WRONG! You wanna try another Beatles song?
If that's not the song "Hold Me" then what is it?
That  Beatles song has to do with a block of time. Time hint hint!
I know the song says "I love you all the time."
You kind of rusty at this. The song is named 8 Days-"
"A Week!" Man! How could I forget that one. It was a big hit for the Beatles years ago. I should have known that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah I do.
Is there a song that you don't particularly like by the Beatles?
That I don't like?
Yeah.
I'm not crazy about the earlier stuff, like I want to hold your hand.
Oh yeah I can see what you mean.
It just doesn't do it for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite song by the Beatles?
I really love Yellow Submarine!
Why do you like that song?
Well, its just a fun song with great lyrics.
Interesting.  Did you ever see the movie Yellow Submarine?
No, though i have heard great things about it.
Yes, it is a great movie.
OK, I will have to check it out.
You should!  You can get it on Amazon.
I will.  Thank you for the recommendation!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is this band?
The Beatles!  This is one of their first songs.
Oh, how did I not recognize that?
Because the song isn't played that much.  This is "Please Please Me," one of their first hits.
Cool!  What's your favorite Beatles song?
"Let It Be," how about yours?
"A Hard Day's Night."
That's a great one too!  When I hear that first note I get excited about the song!
Yes, it's much better than this song actually.
I agree, they got better later in their career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who did The Beatles see as their contemporaries that they were competing with?
I know that they for sure saw The Beach Boys as contemporaries.
Yeah, I've heard Pet Sounds was influenced by The Beatles.
Yup! And Pet Sounds in turn influenced The Beatles.
What a neat little feedback loop.
Yeah, it's really cool to see how different bands interact with and influence each other. No band is self-contained.
Anyone else that you know of that influenced, competed with The Beatles who were contemporaries?
Bob Dylan, for sure. I know that his lyrics had a big impact on The Beatles.
Yeah, he pretty much influenced everyone. Not surprising as The Beatles have great taste and Dylan is a legend.
Yeah, also bands like The Who, The Byrds, and of course musicians from India like Ravi Shankar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah I would say so.
You a really big fan?
Not really just know a little of their stuff.
Do you have a favorite beatle?
I don't know.  Maybe Ringo?
Oh man ringo ouch.
Is that not good?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen any old recording of beatles performances?
Yes, they are all over the internet and T.V.
Well I am just wondering what those woman who are seen crying and screaming think now.
Some are probably embarrassed. Others are probably just to have screen time.
I thought more are they ashamed of making a fool of themself?
Beatles were huge and these women were girls so I think they probably would just laugh it off. Or recall happy memories.
True, it would be kind of neat to see you younger self in that scenario.
Today I feel people would be much more aware of themselves at concerts.
Girls would be too busy taking selfies to appreciate the musicians.
For a band like the beatles that would have been a  true shame. I wish I could have seen them live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the greatest Beatles song of all time is?
I think Yesterday is the greatest.
Why do you think Yesterday is the greatest?
Because I like the rhythm track the best.
What about the rhythm track do you like?
I like the chord progressions.
What else do you like?
I like the way Ringo keeps time on the drums.
Do you wish the Beatles were still around today?
Yes, I do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to the Beatles ever?
Yeah I listen to them regularly.
What is your favorite album by them?
I like Abbey Road a lot.
Which song?
Mean Mr. Mustard.
Wow I never heard someone say that before.
Yeah it is not their most famous song but I like it.
It is alright! I am not judging.
Thank you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Beatle?
Wow now that was a band, John Lennon.
I remember when they first hit America. Paul McCartney was my favorite.
Yea all the girls thought he was the cutest.
I still love him today. He was a great writer and composer.
I love the song Yesterday.
Me too. I really loved Hey Jude, Let It Be, Yellow Submarine, Rocky Raccoon and so many more.
I did too. I loved the Sargent Pepper Album, the songs were great.
So was the cover at. There were a lot of famous people on the cover.
You are right. They were really innovative musicians.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
Hmm...I really like Here Comes the Sun!
Ooh, that's a good song! What do you like about it?
It just sounds so happy! And I love the guitar part.
I like While My Guitar Gently Weeps!
I like that one too! Did you know Eric Clapton played the lead guitar on that?
I did! Have you heard Santana's version of it?
Yes! It is really good!
I know! I also enjoyed Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton's performance of it at the Queen's Golden Jubilee.
I haven't heard that! I'll have to look it up!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the earlier beatles music or the later Beatles music better.
The earlier songs are some of my favorites.
Like which songs?
She Loves You and I Wanna Hold Your Hand.
Those are both good songs.
I think some of the later songs got too far out there.
I think they were doing a lot of drugs then.
Like Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds being about LSD?
Exactly. Some of the later songs lost the simpleness of the earlier music.
They did seem to get more complicated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Do you like the Beatles?
Sure.
Who is your favorite Beatle?
I like John.
Oh okay.
What about you?
I like Paul.
I see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Beatles?
Yes I love the Beatles.
What is your favorite album by them?
I love The White Album.
I like that too but I also like Abbey Road.
Oh yeah I love that too. Here Comes the Sun is a great song from that.
From the White album I like Blackbird the best.
Understandable, that is a great song.
Oh! Darling is also a nice song.
Totally!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles fan?
I'm not a die hard fan but I do like some of their music.
They are seriously one of the best selling bands in history.  There were just so many hits.  What songs do you like?
I mean, probably my favorite is Imagine.
That isn't really a Beatles song.  That one was by John Lennon.
But he was in the Beatles right?
Yeah he was but he came out with that one in the 80s after they'd already broken up.
Why did they break up again if they were doing so well?
A lot of people think it was because of Yoko but I think they were kind of just done.  John Lennon said he was leaving in 1969.
I'm surprised they haven't made like a huge blockbuster hit going over their life story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the Beatles music have as big an impact as we think?
This is a good question because I have heard both sides.
I mean I think some of the songs like Help have really made an impact on people.
Right but what did it do.
I think their music told people it was OK to be different.
Yeah but wasnt there already different music?
This is what I struggle with.
I think their music has a lasting impact in that it showed how to vary four chords.
But what about what they did for the globe.
They just made it known you can live a lavish lifestyle and still write good songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to the Beatles often?
Not really.
You know their music though right?
Yeah, I think everyone knows a few of their songs.
What's your favorite song by them?
I would have to say Hey Jude.
Why would you say that?
Probably because it's the first one I thought of.
It is pretty well known.
Yeah, it really is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Beatles album is your favorite?
I like the compilation albums, like the Black Album.
So you like more of their popular music.
Yes.  What about you?
Oh, I definitely love the classics - Hey Jude. Let it Be. I Want to Hold Your Hand.
Do you know the meaning behind some of the music?
Yes.  I'm aware that Blackbird is about racism in the 60s.
Did you know that You've Got to Hide Your Love Away is about their manager who was homosexual?
Oh, interesting.  That makes sense though.
Yes. And there are some amazing modern covers of their songs as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite groups of all time are The Beatles.
They are the best ever.
I can't think of any songs by them that I don't completely love.
I don't know which is my favorite.
I really like the more pop-like songs like Yellow Submarine.
Me too!
But I also really like the ones that are more like Come Together.
What a great song!
It has a different sound but I really dig it.
Oh yeah!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here the new Beatles channel on SiriusXM yet?
No I haven't tuned in yet.
Oh my god it's great!
Really? I have to give it a shot.
Well worth it.
I'm sure it is. It's the Beatles!
Exactly. Not just songs either.
What do you mean?
Interviews with Paul and ringo.
Wow,that's cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who sings I am the Walrus?
That is The Beatles
Which singer?
Paul and John I think
Really?
Yes. Paul does the second half and John does the first.
It is a unique song then?
Yes. There are two totally different parts.
That is cool. They probably have many dongs like that.
Yes. Happiness is a Warm Gun is another example.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to have a Beatles song played at your funeral what would it be?
My first, non-reflective answer is to say "In My Life." It's a retrospective of an entire life.
Yeah, it's really a great song of love and memory. So poignant for a pop song.
Mmm-hmm, it also has the right tempo and mood for a service like that. What would you go with?
"You Won't See Me." Ha! Ha! Ha!
You're kidding, right?
Yes, of course. That'd be a little cruel.
Okay, so what's your actual choice?
I think Let It Be would be my pick. It's also a really good retrospective and the lyrics are about dealing with pain and loss and depression.
Yeah, that's a really good one. "Have a number of great songs ready to play at your funeral" isn't a standard form of praise for a band, but it's so true in the case of The Beatles!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Beatles will continue to re release their albums like they have with some.
I think so. I believe they are all going to be available on vinyl again.
Wow,that would be great.
I have most of the original Beatles albums from when I,was,growing up.
I do too. Great album covers.
They were very creative in that respect also
Nothing like going out and buying the brand new Beatles album.
Seemed like everyone I knew was waiting for the next one.
Incredible albums they wrote
Never be another band like them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you ever able to go to a Beatles' concert when they first came to America?
No, but that would be quite a memory to see them at that time period. The earlier songs are the best.
I really liked P.S. I Love You and Do You Want to Know A Secret.
Do You want to Know A Secret was one of the few earlier songs sung by George Harrison.
Their earlier songs were so optimistic and joyful.  Why do you think they were so popular at that time?
I think that there were so many Baby Boomers coming of age, that they just fell in line when it came to the Beatles.
The Beatles really worked well together in the beginning. Love Me Do and Please, Please Me harmonies were so addictive to listen too.
I think I Saw Her Standing There just epitomizes the earlier songs -- full of energy and the great guitar of George Harrison.
These early songs really targeted the teenage girl audience.  I recall all the screaming and fainting when they sang!
Yes. The first line of If I Fell In Love With You just seemed so personal and the women loved it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know something that trips me out
What man
Well before any of them died they made a best of
Yeah?
It had most of their songs but the thing that trips me is not in the music
What is it
Well the cover the first one to do Lennon is the only one in a white suit
That is pretty trippy
It is almost prophetic
Some weird stuff
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you tell me anything about the Abbey Road by the Beatles? I really like that one.
Sure. Abbey Road was the 11th studio album by the Beatles that was released in 1969. The interesting thing about it was it was the last album all four participated on.
Wasn't it true that the famous cover was based on a Paul McCartney sketch?
Yes, the legend has it Paul sketched the idea.
Can you tell me more about the famous shoot for the cover?
The photo was taken on August 8 1969 outside EMI studios on Abbey Road at 11:35 am in the morning.
Do you know who the photographer was that took that famous shot?
It was Iain Macmillian who interesting enough was only given 10 minutes to get the shot because the cops would only allow traffic to be stopped for 10 minutes.
Is there a legacy for that walk?
Oh, yes it is probably the most famous walk in popculture that still gets talked about today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When's the last time you listened to The Beatles?
I don't know, last week?
Huh. There goes my theory, I guess...
What's your theory?
That anyone in 2017 who listens to The Beatles is actually just faking it. Because honestly, there's so much new, good music.
Wow...harsh.
I'm just saying. Why listen to The Beatles when you can listen to Lorde?
Um...you kind of can't compare The Beatles to Lorde.
Just did, though. So what are you gonna do about it?
I'm going to blast Ticket To Ride, that's what I'm gonna do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, I miss the Beatles.
Who doesn't? I guess people who don't know what good music is wouldn't.
I just miss how most of their songs were uplifting and had such meaning.
They had a couple of strange ones too.
Well, of course they did. But what ones are you thinking of?
Take your pick, I Am The Walrus, Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds, Strawberry Fields Forever.
I still think that those songs had meaning, it just used interesting language.
I am not saying they didn't, they are just not as obvious as some of their other songs like Let It Be or Blackbird.
I still think they are one of the best bands of all time.
Only a fool would debate you on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite unknown Beatles song?
Unknown huh? I guess I can't go with Hey Jude?
Unfortunately not!
Okay - I really like "Polythene Pam" then
I've never heard of it - what can you tell me?
It's on their Abbey Road album
Great album, why do you like it so much?
It's full of cultural references to Liverpool. To me it shows that even at their peak they still stayed true to their roots
Oh, that's pretty funny
Yeah - at the end John Lennon even fakes a Liverpool accent
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the first Beatles song you remember?
I don't know. Probably Hey Jude.
That was an early one for me, too, but my earliest was Hello Goodbye. We had the single from when it first came out!
Very cool!
Yeah, I thought it was a children's record! I can still remember listening to it on the little record player by the fireplace in our family room.
Totally cool. I remember Hey Jude from the radio.
Same here! Everyone in the car shut up when it was playing.
Well, that's rare!
So true! We had that single, too, and my neice, Liz, used to go crazy at the "Hey Jude-a Jude-a Jude-a Jude-a" part at the end.
Kids are so funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles Album?
I think I'd have to go with Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, what about you?
Good choice! I'd have to say the White Album
Interesting. Did you know it's actually not titled the White Album?
No way - what do you mean?
Yeah, it's actually a self-titled album.
You mean it's just called "The Beatles"?
Yep, exactly. The White Album is just a nickname that has stuck
I had no idea! I've been saying it wrong all along.
Yeah, you learn something new everyday
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the revolver album is lame
By who
Who else
Well their is many albums by that name
The beatles Duh
Oh i love that one though
How it is so trash
Nah it is the tops
You need to listen to their other albums
I have though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about the Beatles!
Okay sounds good!
I love the Beatles so much. My favorite album is The White Album.
I love the song Glass Onion from that.
That song is alright. I like Dear Prudence the best.
I get bored with that song at times.
I like Golden Slumbers too.
I will have to give that song another go.
Definitely do that, it is great!
Will do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like the Beatle's Anthology.
There sure was a lot of stuff.
Yes. I like the different takes on the songs.
My reason for liking them is because it shows the creative process.
Yes. We were talking a bout The Long and Winding Road earlier.
That is the best non embellished cut.
Some say there were too many undeserving cuts on the Anthology.
Some people don't get it.
Yeah. They don't realize the point you made earlier
About the creative process, I think that is why it was put together that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so happy!
Why's that?
The Beatles music is now on most of the major streaming services.
Wow! That's excellent news.
I know, it has been annoying since I've gotten so dependent on Spotify, that I would always have to find my old CDs.
Yeah, streaming is the future of music and not having The Beatles music on there was limiting access to a younger generation.
For sure. I've actually been listening to a lot of their really early stuff on Spotify that I've never listened to.
Like what?
The album Please Please Me. It has a few songs I know, like I Saw Her Standing There, Twist and Shout, and Love Me Do, but most of it is unfamiliar.
That's really cool. I'm in a similar place, I haven't listened to it either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was in Japan, it seemed like every convenience store was playing Yesterday.
Huh, the Beatles' song?
Yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like the song.
It's not my favorite.
Sure, but it's still a good song.
I just don't really like McCartney as a singer.
That's surprising to me. It's my favorite song on Help!
Well, it's definitely the most famous.
Anyway, it was just weird to hear it so often in a foreign country.
The Beatles really are popular all over the world!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the last two Beatles singles from the anthology series?
Yes I did. I thought they were awesome.
Great to know they wouldn't put out anything new without John somehow contributing.
That was the Beatles. It wouldn't have been a true Beatles song if it was just from the remaining three at the time.
I think they are classic. Free as a bird and real love I play a lot.
Seemed like a continuance of abbey road.
Yes,they reminded me of abbey road.
More classic Beatles songs decades after they broke up.
One of a kind band.
Nothing like them will ever come along again
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best beatles song
I do not know
You have to get this right!
I can try i guess
Okay then pick one
Okay let me think for a moment
Stop stalling
Ok Ok hey jude
Nope that is wrong
No fair!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the theme of The Beatles music?
I think it is love.
Why is that?
A large chunk of their songs are about love.
Can you name one of their love songs?
Yes, Oh Darling
Oh, that is a great tune.
Do you know who sings that song?
No, who?
Paul McCartney
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't The Beatles just make you want to curl up on the beach and take a nap?
Never thought about it like that, but I guess so.
Yeah! The perfect chill music.
They're so old, though.
Yeah they're mostly dead, but that's not the point of music is it?
I guess not.
If only they could have reunited first.
That would have been pretty cool
I'd have some new chill music, at least!
Here Comes the Sun is pretty good
XXXXXXXXXXX
You remember that rumor that Paul was dead?
Yeah. Supposedly he was replaced by a double.
Ridiculous. At that time, the early sixties, stuff was hard to refute to the fans..
Let's see, the left foot right foot "evidence".
Yes. The double was just for show and George Martin wrotw the "Paul" songs.
How about the one that some song actually had the phrase "Paul is dead"
I don't remember the song, but yes.
Long time ago, I tried that. It was a vinyl disc.
Was it true?
I can't say it sounded like what people describe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to many alternate recordings of Beatles songs?
Nope, can't say I have. I've only listened to regular single and album versions.
Ah, for shame, you're missing out.
Are there a lot of alternate versions out there?
Yup, there are a ton. I'm listening to an alternate version of "I'm Looking Through You" which is super delightful.
That's a great song. Is the alternate version much different?
The melody is the same, but the arrangement is quite different.
That's probably my favorite kind of alternate version.
Me too! Demos and early versions are fun, but I like when the arrangement is totally different.
I see there's an album called Anthology that has a ton of alternates. I'm gonna give it whirl!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like music by the Beatles?
I really do, especially their music after their album "Revolver".
What album after "Revolver" is your favorite?
My favorite album is "Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", however "Abby Road" is a close second.
Abbey Road is one of my favorites. I really enjoyed the song "Here Comes the Sun".
I like that song, especially since George Harrison sang it.
Is George Harrison your favorite Beatle?
I don't really have a favorite as they were all so talented. I do like George Harrison's guitar work.
What about the guitar work in "The End"? I understand George, Paul McCartney, and John Lennon played each of the three sets of solos in that song.
I did like the guitar work but the best part of that song are the lyrics at the end. "And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like the Beatles?
They are OK; I like some of their stuff I hear on the radio.
What songs do you like?
I guess the pop type ones like "She Loves You" and "Eight Days a Week".
Oh, OK you like the early stuff. I prefer the older stuff but the early music is fun sometimes.
Yeah, the songs are cute and easy to listen to.
Yeah definitely. The early stuff was mostly John and Paul singing.
Oh yeah John Lennon. I like the harmonies.
Yeah John and Paul are amazing songwriters.
The ones I like tend to be pretty simple though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Paul McCartney lately?
No honestly not since I was looking through my dad's old Beatles albums
Does he still have a bunch?
Yeah I think he has pretty much all of them, The one with Abbey Road is my favorite
I enjoyed the whole drug period they went through
Absolutely, Yellow Submarine is my favorite all time Beatles song
Have you heard "A Day in the Life"?
I think so that one is a little weird
Once again drug period lol
haha true they were pretty messed up at the point in there career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Abbey Road was the last album recorded by the Beatles?
I thought it was Let it Be
Let it Be came out last but was recorded before Abbey Road
Wow you learn somethign everyday
So with that what song did you like the most
I thought Come Together was awesome
Yeah it was great but mine is Here Comes the Sun
I believe George wrote that right
Yeah it was one of the few he did pen himself.
Thats crazy the songs he did write were all great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Beatle's music?
Yes, I do.  My favorite Beatles song is "Hey Jude."
Well, I know an interesting piece of trivia about that song.  Did you know that "Hey Jude" was not the original title?
What?!  What was the title?
Well, Paul McCartney originally wrote it as a tribute to John Lennon's son, Julian.  So he called it "Hey Jules."
Wait a minute--I didn't know John Lennon had a kid back in those days!
Yes, he was married and had a son before the Beatles even became famous.
So why did the song title get changed?
I'm not sure about that, but I remember reading that the lyrics changed before it was recorded and so the title changed.
Okay, now I have to listen to that song again and see if I can pick up on the tribute part.  Thanks for the info!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Beatles song do you think is the most overrated?
Hmm. Let me look at their compilation 1, which is made up of all their number one hits.
That's a good idea. The songs are clearly held in high esteem by the public if they were number one hits.
Exactly, these songs shot to the top of the charts.
I'm looking now and "Love is All You Need" is probably the song I find most overrated.
Why's that?
I know the end gets experimental, but to me it's a little too repetitive and a little too lovey dovey.
Well, I'm still looking at this list. I disagree about "Love is All You Need."
Well, what will it be then?
I'm going to go with "Eight Days a Week." I love their early stuff, but this track just doesn't connect with me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last beatles song?
I believe it was Now And Then (also known as "I Don't Want To Lose You" or "Miss You")
I think the piano on that track is so haunting.
Yes, it has a very sad quality. You really feel the melancholy.
It is a very bitter sweet song, fits the them.
Yes, I felt the vocals were slightly weak.
I do see what you mean but feel they fit so well with the vibe of the song.
I suppose it does add to the theme and melancholy sound.
Exactly you can really hear and feel the pain and longing in the vocal performance.
True, It makes me feel sad whenever I do hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yes, I do, they're one of my favorite bands.
How did you start listening to them?
My mom had all their records when I was growing up, and she told me to go listen to them when I was about 14.
Records? Like actual vinyl?
Ha, ha. Yes. Real records. My favorite was the White Album.
Is Blackbird on that one?
Yes! And Dear Prudence. That's my favorite.
Sargent Pepper is my favorite Beatles record.
Yes, that's a classic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you listen to the Beatles?
Yeah.
What was the last song that you listened to?
Oh, let me think.
Okay.
I heard Yesterday on the radio not too long ago.
Yeah I love that song.
Same here.  A true classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles album?
Easy, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band.
Really? I understand that it's innovative, but I find that it lags in places.
I love all of it. It's the first record that challenged me to give multiple deep listens.
I can't argue with that.
What's your favorite Beatles album?
It's got to be Revolver.
Why Revolver?
I find it to be the most pleasant mix of pop and experimentation. It's concise too!
I see what you're saying, it doesn't drag on at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Stu Sutcliffe?
Sounds familiar.  Who is he?
He was in the Beatles.
Wait, I've never heard that name in the Beatles.
Well, he was in the band before it was popular.
What instrument did he play?
He played the guitar.
Was he kicked out?
No, he actually quit, but I think he died at a young age.
Wow, that's pretty tragic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what have you been listening to lately?
I've been going back through my Beatles albums. I love them.
I could never really get into them. What albums should I listen to?
My personal favorite is Rubber Soul. It was the very beginning of their psychedelic period.
Is that the one where they are standing in the street on the album cover?
That's their last album Abby Road. Rubber Soul is from around 1965.
I'll have to check them out. I think my dad has a bunch of their records.
You should definitely listen to them on vinyl especially Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, That one is a classic.
I'll look for that one. Anything else I should listen to.
Every one of their albums is great. I think you would also enjoy the white album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what are your thoughts on the song free as a bird?
I liked how chill this song felt. Very laid back sound.
That is true. you almost felt like you were soaring along.
Originally it was recorded in 1977 by John Lennon.
That is right. They ended up releasing it in 1995.
Ya  it was a huge deal that it was being put out.
I do recall all the hype. Well worth it.
Agreed it is such a beautiful song.
It would have been a shame for it to remain hidden away.
I wonder how many others there are tucked away somewhere..  they should release anything and everything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the song Blackbird by the Beatles?
No I thought it was too slow.
Yeah I would agree with you, how about Help?
Yeah that song was too good.
I think they really worked on their instrumentation on that album.
When they recorded together the sound was better.
i cant believe they didnt always record together.
I think the fame got too some guys.
In what respect?
They couldnt stand one another by the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite oldies song by the Beatles?
They are legends! My favorite will have to be 'Hey Jude.'
That is one of their most popular songs for sure. It has such nice ballads.
I agree. What is your favorite?
I have so much, but if I have to pick a favorite, 'Don't Let Me Down' hands down.
That song takes me back to the old days.  How about 'Here Comes The Sun'?
I know I can't believe how much time has passed.  Of course, that song is so beautiful.
It was played at a wedding I attended recently.
Really? It that song is classic. I want to buy a record now.
Me too, let's checkout a nearby vintage shop and see if we can snag some old Beatles albums.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yeah, I love them! I grew up listening to them a lot with my mom.
What's your favorite song?
My favorite is Hey Jude. What about yours?
My favorite is Yesterday. Funny that we both like slow, softer songs.
Yeah, especially when their bouncy, poppy songs are so fun!
I love Paperback Writer. That's probably my favorite upbeat song of theirs.
I really like Ticket to Ride. It's so funny and fun to sing along.
Yes! I forgot about that song. It makes me think of the movies the Beatles used to make.
I haven't seen any of them. Maybe we should watch one together!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite beatle?
I liked George Harrison the most, he was always referred to as the gentle beatle.
What is your favorite beatles album?
I think Sgt Pepper's lonely hearts club band was groundbreaking.
Have you ever seen one of the beatles in concert?
Yes, I saw Paul McCartney a few years ago.
Do you think the beatles are overrated?
No, I actually think they are one of the best bands of all time.
Did you ever see the beatle's movie a hard day's night?
No, I didn't know they made a movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My friend at Penn State University signed up for a class on The Beatles this semester.
That's brilliant! I wish I could take a class on The Beatles.
I know that Coursera, the free online college course website was offering one at one point.
I'll have to look into that. At the very least, I want to take a book about The Beatles out from the library.
I can only imagine that there are so many quality books about The Beatles. They defined 60s culture in a super significant way.
Yes, as far as Anglo-American culture goes, I don't know who can plausibly be claimed to have a bigger impact.
People talk about Dylan having a huge influence.
That's true, but not Beatles level.
Well, what about the Velvet Underground, weren't so many famous bands inspired to start bands after seeing The Velvet Underground.
There are some prominent examples, but I think if we made an attempt to quantify influence that the Velvet Underground would pale in comparison to the Beatles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the Beatles recorded "All You Need Is Love" 50 years ago today?
Are you serious?! That's amazing. I love that song.
I love it, too. It's one of my favorites.
Is that on the Sgt. Pepper album?
No. Magical Mystery Tour.
Oh, right! Which was actually a soundtrack for that weird rockumentary.
Haha, yeah! The psychedelic bus trip...
There were some great songs on that album, though.
Of course! "The Fool on the Hill" and "Penny Lane" and the unforgettable title track.
"Strawberry Fields Forever," "Baby, You're a Rich Man," "Hello, Goodbye"... gosh, practically every song on that album was a hit!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever looked at their discography
Well yeah who has not
I mean look at the dates
Like the release dates
Yeah the release dayes
Well i guess
You see how many they released in 64 it was insane
It was alot of albums
Noone releases that many now
Nope not at all
XXXXXXXXXXX
Of the Beatles' later albums, which is your favorite?
Abbey Road, without a doubt. It really displays the strengths of each member.
Yes, there's a lot to like on that record, but overall, I think I'm put off by the slickness of it. It's like you can hear the 1970s looming ahead.
Hey, there's nothing wrong with that! I love that side 2 medley.
There are lots of high points, but still I prefer the rough edges and inconsistency of Let It Be--I think I'm the only one!
But that album is such a downer.
I don't know, it just feels more human to me somehow. And who doesn't love the title track and Hey Jude?
What do you think of the stripped down version that came out a few years ago, the one without the Phil Spector production?
I gave it a listen. I like how it gives some insight into what they were thinking at the time, but you can't really go back in time and re-experience it as new.
I know what you mean--a lot of water under the bridge since then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Beatle?
Well, that's a tough question to answer.
Why is that?
Well, they were kind of unlikable in a lot of ways.
Really - how so?
Well, John Lennon was a notorious nutjob. He even beat his wife!
No way - really?
Yeah, and Paul is very difficult to work with.
That's a shame, I always liked Sir Paul.
Yeah - maybe he's changed. I guess my favorite would be Ringo!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I heard you like The Beatles.
They're fine, yeah. Kinda grew up on them, my dad was a fan.
What's your favorite song, then?
Hey Jude.
Okay, you're not a real Beatles fan.
Who are you to say?
If your favorite Beatles song is Hey Jude then you don't even know The Beatles.
You're what I like to call a music snob, not worth my time.
What next, Here Comes The Sun?
That's a good song and you know it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Of the Beatles, do you consider yourself more of a John or a Paul fan?
I always loved John, the way he'd push the creative envelope. You just never knew what he'd do next.
Now that you mention it, I could have seen that from the style of eyeglasses that you're wearing.
Yes, I love the look, but more the songs, like I Am the Walrus.
How about his lesser known ones? Any I should know?
I always had a soft spot for Julia, from the White Album. It's so wistful.
Good to know. I've always been more of a Paul person myself--just an incomparable body of work.
Yes, I can't deny he seemed to be a more disciplined writer with quite an ear for melody.
And I think his solo work stands up better. Band on the Run is one of my favorite records of all time.
Touche. But I'd gladly trade all of 1980s Paul for Imagine!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate getting stuck in traffic. Do you want to play a music trivia game while we are waiting?
Yeah, I'll go first. I will give you three clues and then you have to make your guess.
Okay, but you have to say if it is a person, song, or a band. Stay in our era I don't know much about today's music.
Alright, this is a four man band that popular in the sixties.
Were they Americans?
You can't ask questions, just listen to the clues. The second clue is they are from Liverpool.
Well, I think I got it but I will take the last clue.
Their first hit song was in 1962 named "Love Me Do".
It has to be the Beatles. Now it is my turn to give you clues.
Give me clues that give me a real chance of figuring it out like I did you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
You've heard of the Beatles before right?
Yes of course.
Who do you like more Paul or John?
That's an easy one.  John.
Oh really see I like Paul.
John was so much cooler.
I think without Paul there wouldn't have been a Beatles.
The same could be said for John.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Beatle?
That's a hard one - I know most people would say John or Paul, but I like George
Really? why George? He didnt really get to do many songs with the Beatles.
But the ones he did get to make were my favorites especially "Something"
"Something" is a great song for sure. I like stuff like "Revolution #9"
Well which album is your favorite? I like "Rubber Soul"
Mine would be the White Album or Sgt. Pepper. - those are great albums.
Yeah they are really good but you can't be Rubber Soul - its the transition album that made the Beatles more experimental.
True. Its quite different from those early records.
Yeah, thats why it's my favorite - you can really measure the growth in songwriting with this album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best Beatle?
I'm going to say Paul McCartney-- he contributed so much to the Beatles, and had a long career and good hits after.
John Lennon is my favorite-- I love his songs, except Revolution 9.  That's not even really a song.
Yeah, that song is awful.  It's probably the worst song ever, if you can even call it a song.
All of the Beatles were really talented, even Ringo.
Yeah, Octopus' Garden and Don't Pass Me By are both really good songs.
What about George Harrison?
Frank Sinatra called Something the greatest love song ever written.  Who am I to argue with ol' Blue Eyes?
No one-- that's who! What's your favorite Beatles album?
They're all really good, but I'm going to go with Abbey Road.  I love how the songs flow together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, bands like the Beatles are still so applicable today.
Yes! I totally agree! Eleanor Rigby talks about how lonely people are when they are disconnected, and that's so true in our age of modern technology.
And Yesterday talks about longing for the past.
I find that song so much more beautiful now that I'm starting to get older.
What about Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds?
Ok, I'm not even sure I know what that song is about.
Which Beatles song do you think is the best then?
Help! for sure. It's catchy and describes relationships well.
For me, it's blackbird. So sweet and open.
That one is really good. It feels like it could be a follow up to She's Leaving Home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Yellow Submarine album?
I do actually, not my favorite Beatles album, in fact I feel it's near their worst, but since it's The Beatles still has it's moments.
What would your favorite be then?
I can't really choose between Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or Abbey Road.
I sometimes think I'm alone in my adoration for yellow submarine, it's not very highly regarded amongst their albums.
I mean it's The Beatles, so it still has some redeeming value and some great songs, although the title track I always felt was cheesy, sorry Ringo Star.
I think it's ultimately a reflection of my musical taste as a whole, I tend to go against the grain.
I just think you need to give the two albums I named another try.
I'll give them a fresh listen.
Please do, surely you will end up liking them better than Yellow Submarine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you tell me anything about the Beatles Hamburg,Germany experience?
Sure,they played there from 1960 to 62.
Why was this a crucial period for them?
They played there for hours which honed their skills to get to be the best.
Didn't a member die there?
Yes, sadly Stu Sutcliffe died of a brain hemorage there at the young age of 21.
What about Pete Best?
He was the drummer who played in Hamburg for the Beatles. Ringo came along and replaced him a little later.
Anything about The Top Ten andThe Star-Club?
They were the main clubs the Beatles performed in during the Hamburg period.  Historically, I would love to go back in a time machine to see the Beatles play those clubs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did people burn Beatle records in the 1960s?
Because John Lennon had the famous qoute "More popular than Jesus" (or "bigger than Jesus"
People really got that offended by that?
Yes,Christian communities really got upset, and the Beatles even got death threats.
Did this factor in the Beatles decision to stop touring?
Yes, because they started to get bad publicity in such that their concerts no longer sold out.
I heard even the KKK got involved?
Yes, the KKK picketed some Beatles concerts.
If John never made that statement would they have continued to perform?
Who is to say? My guess is no. They boys were tired of the scrutity by the media, and it was time to for the studio route.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There was an article the other day about the top five songs on the Billboard chart for 35 years ago this week.
Who was number one?
One of the Beatles, Paul McCartney, singing a duet with Stevie Wonder called "Ebony and Ivory."
That song was really popular.
It was the longest song Stevie Wonder ever had at the top of the charts.
Did he write the song?
No, Paul McCartney wrote it. It was also McCartney's longest song at the top of the charts since he had played with the Bealtes.
I'm glad McCartney stayed in music after the Beatle's broke up.
I know, it's nice to see people go on and keep doing what they love, instead of letting circumstances end things for them.
It doesn't matter if it's not as successful as before, just that you are doing what you enjoy and you're good at.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, are you a Beatles fan?
Not really.  I've never understood what was so great about them.
Part of their 'legacy' is realizing what else was going on in music at the time.
Like doo wop, girl groups, Elvis, and leftover Sinatra-type of songs?
Yes.  The Beatles moved pop/rock music away from that lighter 'bubble gum' sound, and went back to its roots.  Latching on to the rhythm and blues coming from artists like Chuck Berry and other less famous (but just as talented) black musicians, the Beatles then moved the sound into exciting new directions.
But, really, isn't it just simple 3 and 4 chord rock songs?
That is part of what made them great.  If you play any instrument, you should look for transcriptions of Beatles songs and play along.  Even the simple songs use unexpected chord structures that, although they sound simple, give the music added sonic depth.
What songs would you suggest I listen to?
With the Beatles, you're better off listening to full albums.  They were putting out music at a time when a great deal of care went into crafting an album in a way that the songs built one on the other to make something greater than the individual parts.  Try the albums 'Revolver' or 'Rubber Soul'.
Ok.  I'll give the Beatles another try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to The Beatles lately?
Of course. I have been listening to Abbey Road.
Oh I love that album.
Me too.
What song is your favorite on it?
I love the song Because.
Nice song. I like Sun King.
I actually do not like that song much.
Just give it a chance though!
I will!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Beatles?
The band? My family likes them but I'm not that familiar with their songs
You've probably heard some of their songs, though, right?
Yes, like All You Need is Love and popular songs like that
They have a pretty big range of songs that cross genres, so you'd probably enjoy some of their music if you gave it a try
What's your favorite Beatles song?
It's too difficult to choose, but I like Girl from Rubber Soul and Here, There, and Everywhere from Revolver
I'll have to check those out sometime
Those albums came out around the same time, yet they're so different. You should check out Abbey Road, too.
Sounds cool, I've heard of that, so I'll give it a try
XXXXXXXXXXX
Since you love the Sgt.Pepper cover,than who are your favority celebrities on it?
Let me think a minute.
It sure was a work of art that cover/
Shirley Temple,Maryln Monroe,Huntz Hall and H.G.WELLS are my favorites.
I kind of like the more obscure ones like Fatty Arbuckle,and Tom Mix.
Yeah,those guys actually were not obscure in the 1960s.
Really?I didn't know that.
Yeah Fatty was the king of silent comedies in the 20s whose career was ruined by scandal,while Tom Mix was a popular singing cowboy who got killed in a car accident.
The albums just is amazing piece of pop culture.
Maybe the best album cover of all-time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you're not a Sgt Pepper guy. What album do you go for, then?
I dunno. It's a toss-up, depending on what the weather's like -- but the safe answer may be Revolver.
Revolver. Didn't that come right before Sgt Pepper?
Yeah, it did. You can kind of think of it as a precursor or rough draft for the ideas that would end up going overboard and result in Pepper.
What, like the concept album thing?
No, I mean the way the songs are written and recorded. This and Rubber Soul kind of make up a pair, but whereas Rubber Soul was more like a refined and well-developed extension of the music they'd been doing, Revolver takes that another step toward the idea of the studio as an instrument.
Oh, yeah. They quit touring around this time, right?
Exactly, yeah. Rubber Soul was, I think, the first thing they did once they locked themselves away in the studio and had some time to think about what they were doing. Revolver's the more developed second effort, where they really go to town with exploring the benefits of sitting around all this equipment rather than bopping around the globe.
So there's sort of a logical progression? There's the simple music they wrote while they were, uh, bopping around -- then they sat still and took the time to be deliberate, then they figured out what made studio recording unique, then they went ridiculous with it.
Right; it's all the same creative flow. That's one of the things I find so interesting about the Beatles -- how transparently you can trace their creative development.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Give me 3 hints and I will try to guess your favorite Beatles song
Okay, it is from the the Please Please Me album.
Is it Love Me Do?
Nope! But that is one of my top 10.
Okay, who did lead vocals on your favorite song?
John Lennon
Baby It's You?
No! One more hint, it starts with a T.
Twist and Shout!
Bingo! Good job
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles music?
I normally don't care for that type of music, but I do like the Beatles and their music.
My mom has a 3-disc CD and plays it constantly!
Well, I like Beatles music a little, but wouldn't want to hear it constantly!
I like their song "Don't Let Me Down".
Yeah, I do too. I also like the legendary "Hey Jude".
Which of the Beatles Musicians do you think was best at that type of music?
Definitely Ringo Starr! Their type of music fits him perfectly.
I think John Lennon was born to write and play their Beatle Music.
For sure. I think the Beatles Music will always be loved and played.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you believe it's been fifty years since Sgt Pepper
It was twenty years ago plus thirty I guess.
Unbelievable. I guess it's my favorite Beatle's album.
I like Revolver. Or Rubber Soul. Depends which week it is.
They're my number two and three. Where's Pepper on your list?
Probably three or four. I have a soft spot for Help.
Good album. I watched the movie the other week. Great music videos.
So what's your favorite song on Pepper.
Iguess Day in a Life. Maybe Fixing a Hole? You?
For the Benefit of Mr Kite there will be a show tonight...
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles have 23 songs in Rolling stone's top 500 songs of all time.
Who cares about Rolling Stone's list? It's a stupid magazine
I care! Anyway I just don't like their rankings though
Then you shouldn't care. What are they using to rank them anyway?
Magic 8 ball. I don't know.
Ok What's the highest ranked song?
Hey Jude ranked at no 8.
See, I knew it was gonna be Hey Jude. Real Beatles fan don't listen to Hey Jude.
I listen to Hey Jude all the time. It's a great song. 4 minutes of na na na na  hey jude. it's great
4 minutes of silly na na na na hey jude doesn't make for a great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did The Beatles break up?
I don't know, I've heard people blame Yoko.
I've heard that too, I don't think that's fair.
Yeah, it's totally denying John agency to make decisions.
Exactly, it's ridiculous. It's like Yoko is being totally scapegoated.
I know. John was an adult and could have decided to stay in The Beatles, I've seen no evidence that Yoko forced his hand.
It's sad they broke up.
I know, think of what could have been if you take the best tracks from their solo albums you can put together a few great records.
Yeah, but maybe they wouldn't have been as inspired had they not broken up.
I agree because the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, so it could be better or worse. For sure different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was a better song writer, Lennon or McCarthy
That is the $64,000 question.  And it is really hard to answer
I think it was John Lennon
What makes it hard to answer was an agreement that McCarthy and Lennon made early in their collaboration.
They had an agreement?
They said no matter who wrote the most of or the least of a song, the song would only be credited as written by Lennon and McCarthy
So how can you tell who wrote it.
In the early years it was probably a fair share collaboration between the two
In later years, especially when the songs where big hits, like Yesterday and Imagine, each got their own credit.
I still think John Lennon was the best composer.  I really liked the Ballad of John and Yoko
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Ringo Starr the original Beatles drummer?
No, Pete Best was the original drummer.
When did Ringo join them?
Ringo joined the band in August 1962 after Best was fired.
What songs did Ringo sing on?
He sang lead vocals on 11 of them including Yellow Submarine, Octopus Garden and With a Little Help from My Friends.
Did Ringo write any of the Beatles songs?
He was the write or co writer on 10 songs including Maggie May, What Goes On and Flying.
Was Ringo Starr his real name?
No, Ringo was born Richard Starkey on July 7, 1940.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles song?
That's a tough one. There are so many good songs...
Well if you had to choose two then.
Ok, well I really like "Here Comes the Sun" and "Blackbird".
Great songs. I love "Blackbird".
It's such a beautiful song. My favorite part is the guitar melody that they play.
That song is definitely more toned down and less crazy than some of their other ones.
Yea. Although their more rowdy songs are a lot of fun too.
I love "Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da". It's so silly, but so catchy at the same time.
Yea. It tells such a cute story too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the last Beatles album?
Let it Be was maybe their best.
Not Seargant Peppers?
No, I think that was great but Let it Be sort of let it all go and said this is what we are.
I think they went back to basics with this album.
Yeah its been said that they played this one together.
Across the Universe is a great track.
I think it stands out as their best from the album.
I also loved Ive Got a Feeling
That song didnt do to much for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was hey Jude an album?
I think it was thrown together on Capital records to fulfill a commitment.
I believe it wasn't a preconceived album. Paul wrote it for John's son Julian who he felt bad before because his parents were divorcing.
Correct,and obviously it was a huge hit,but not an album they planned.
I think Capital just took some singles and put them together on an,album and hey Jude became the title track because of its success.
I think I read the same thing. What a great classic song.
It sure was at that. One of my all time favorites.
John actually loved the song.
He did love it and helped paul get through some lyrics he didn't like.
Those two fed off of each other. They were amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What instrument did John Lennon play?
Rhythm guitar.
What did Ringo play?
Drums
Cool, did anyone play the piano?
I know Paul did on Hey Jude
What songs does Ringo sing?
Yellow Submarine, With a Little Help From my Friends, Don't Stop Me Now
Cool, do you like his voice?
I love it. it is deep and has a great sound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rock band of all time?
Yes, my favorite is The Beatles!
Me too. I think they're the greatest band of all time.
Which of their albums do you like best?
That's a tough one, but I think probably Abbey Road. What about you?
My favorite is Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Oh yeah that was a great album. Do you remember what year that came out?
It was released in 1967.
That's right. It came out just one year after Revolver, didn't it?
Yes, you're correct.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What album is "Penny Lane" on?
It was initially released as a single, you won't find it in any of the original albums.
Where can I find it then?
Try the Blue Album.
What's the Blue Album?
It's a compilation of songs from 1967 to 1970.
So it's like a greatest hits album?
Yes, it's a greatest hits album.
I'm going to go buy it. Do you want to come?
Let's go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to the Beatles a lot lately.
Oh? What are some of their best songs?
Here Comes the Sun is one of the best. It is so cheerful and happy.
Oh yeah that is a good one. It always makes me feel happy.
Baby You Can Drive My Car is cute as well. What are your favorites?
Help! is such a classic. So is All You Need is Love.
Great choices. What about Yellow Submarine?
Also good, but not my favorite. Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is probably my all-time favorite.
Oh I love how silly Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da is!
Me too. It always makes me lighten up when I'm being too serious!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Hey Jude?
Yeah I think its one of the best songs they ever wrote.
I loved the instrumentatin on the song.
I think alot of the song parts were written well.
The switch of pace worked well in the song.
And I think the vocals were almost too perfect.
Yeah the inflection used made a huge impact.
I dont think anyone has tried to even cover it
Sure they have thats the point of music
But could anyone have written a track like that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about music
Okay what topic
The Beatles
Great I love them
Me too
John lennon is an icon
So is ringo
Yea they both are
The world needs more of them
True

Some of the Beatles songs changed the face of music.
Yes, "Strawberry Fields Forever" was the start of the psychedelic rock movement.
I heard they also used a synthesizer in "Strawberry Fields Forever".
Yes, it was called a Mellotron.
"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" introduced the sitar to western audiences.
And then there is "Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band".
Yes, it had quite an effect on the Beach Boys.
It actually caused Brian Wilson to have a nervous breakdown.
And we can't forget "I Want to Hold Your Hand".
Of course not since it is the song they played first on "Ed Sullivan".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the nicest of the Beatles?
From my guess George Harrison.
Why George?
Went to India learned about meditation. Really preached peace.
Speaking of peace, why not John Lennon?
John was a hypocrite when it came to peace.
How so?
John admitted to beating both wives,also he abandoned his son.
Wow! Your narrative is so much different than the mainstream media`s.
I do my homework, and it is documented that John Lennon was the meanest Beatle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to any of the slower, sad Beatles songs?
Of course! Some of them make me cry like a baby.
Me too! Which ones?
Yesterday always makes me cry. How about you?
She's Leaving Home makes me cry. Every time I listen to it I have to hear a funny one after.
Like Maxwells Silver Hammer?
Yes! And Mean Mister Mustard
What is your favorite happy Beatles song?
Probably Yellow Submarine or Golden Slumbers.
Those are great songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't think of any group today that even comes close in talent to The Beatles.
I have to agree.  From the time I bought their first U.S. album "Meet the Beatles" till their end with "Let it Be" I always looked forward to getting their records.
Remember how great it was to get an album instead of downloading an MP3?
How can you even  compare the experience of  looking  at the cover of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band while playing the album to just putting it on your Iphone?
I associate so much of my growing up to the different phases of their music.  When Rubber Soul came out in 1965 it sounded so different from everything else.
That is one of my favorite albums.  I heard Paul McCartney live doing "I've Just Seen a Face" from Rubber Soul and he still sounds great!
Funny to think of how people made a big deal of what they thought were drug lyrics in Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Seems so innocent compared to what you hear now.  And people used to play the songs backward on the White Album or Magical Mystery Tour.
Some of the more mainstream artists like Frank Sinatra even covered them.  I know he thought George Harrison's "Something" was one of the best songs ever written.
We were lucky to grow up with The Beatles.  I will never throw out my albums.  I just wish I had their "Yesterday and Today" album with the original butcher cover.  I hear it's worth alot of money!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's funny? I just realized I'm listening to the same music my parents listened to at my age.
Oh yeah, what's that?
I'm really getting into The Beatles. I just listened to the whole Sergeant Pepper album.
Hasn't that been voted the greatest album all time by some of those Rolling Stone type magazines?
I'm not sure, but it's hard to believe this album is 50 years old. It somehow still feels fresh and new.
Some of the songs seem a bit dated to me, but others like "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" sound like an indie band could have made it in the past 5 years.
It's really amazing. Think about the TV from 50 years ago. It was all black and white and doesn't hold up at all today.
Yeah, The Beatles are timeless, I'll give you that.
Not to mention how influential they are. Whether other bands give them credit directly or not, they were trailblazers.
They were revolutionary. It's easy to think of them always being there, but they had to create this music that became the foundation for so much later music we love now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Paul McCartney?
I don't really care for any of his solo stuff or stuff with Wings.
What about with the Beatles?
Oh, sure.  I mean, it's Paul McCartney.
Did you know McCartney and Lennon wrote almost all of the Beatles songbook?
Yeah, they were one of the best songwriting teams ever.
Yeah, I agree with you there.
Didn't Michael Jackson buy their songbook years ago?
Yeah.  In the 90s, I think.
I wonder who owns it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles Fan.
You bet your ass I am, they were amazing.
I know, I have watched their first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show over and over again on YouTube.
I have watched a lot of their old concerts live on YouTube.
The Sargent Pepper album changed music as we know it.
I love Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.  It is one of my favorite songs of all time.
I love that one also. I also love when i'm 64.
I feel like that is always one of their most underrated songs.
Don't forget Lovely RIta
There are just so many on that Album that were amazing songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the beatles perform live?
No too young, my parents did.
Mine too I think my dad still has his ticket stub.
I wonder if it would be worth any big money?
I doubt it, but we joke that if we ever get on antiques roadshow we may bring it and all his albums.
That is funny, but might profit. He has original albums or re releases?
My father has some of both, well all the re released everything but some originals still.
That is cool. i know the later stuff is suppose to sound better being remastered.
It is remastered but I still prefer the older original ones, I like a little crackle in the records.
Well to each there own. I like a clean sound myself but can see the charm of what you enjoy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like covers of the Beattles songs?
Usually I don't.  Where you thinking of something in particular?
Have you heard Amy Winehouse's covers?
I heard a couple. She did a good job but it's still not the same.
Are there any covers you like?
I think the only one I really like was Judy Collin's version of In My Life.
I ilke that one too.  I also really like Motown sings the Beattles.
Oh, I don't like that one at all.
But, I don't like Bette Midler's versions.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to The Beatles' music?
All the time, they were one of my favorite bands.
Which one of the members do you think was the most talented?
They were all great, just in different ways.  Paul McCartney and John Lennon were both great singers, and songwriters.
Which one of The Beatles do you think was the best on his instrument?
Definitely George Harrison, he was a great guitar player.
Do you have a favorite Beatles song written by George Harrison?
While My Guitar Gently Weeps, one of my favorite songs by any band.
Did you know that Eric Clapton played on While My Guitar Gently Weeps?
I did know that. Apparently George Harrison and Eric Clapton were lifelong friends, despite having been married to the same woman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles guitar riff?
I always thought that George Harrison was great in Love Me Do and a Hard Day's night.
Yes, George's guitar playing was underrated.
I was always glad that Paul McCartney got to do Yesterday solo.
True, but it is nice when they have a string section backing Paul up.
I think their version of Please Mr. Postman is such a great 60's song.
Yeah, much better than the covers that came later.
Did you ever see the Beatles play live?
No, but my Mom did.  I've seen some tribute bands.
Those are OK, but I would rather see Paul play live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i got lots of beatles albums
can i buy some
man thats gonna cost you a pretty penny
come on man let me have them for a good price
i can't let these beatles albums go for cheap there classics
that's why i want them how much for two
i really was'nt planing on selling them
i'll give you one hundred dollars for five of them
no way man the beatles go for more than that, try to double that
man tha's high way robbery ,but i'll pay you that if there in good shape.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what beatles song do you feel is underappreciated?
Well that is hard to say they have so many good ones I often forget some that are worthy of attention.
I find the same thing. SO many great songs it is hard to give them enough attention or play time.
I would say one that I overlook then appreciate when I hear it is Beautiful Boy.
I forgot all about that song. which beatle wrote that one?
It was john lennon , he wrote it for his son I think.
That makes sense. Such a good song to celebrate a son.
Yes it is so touching. I especially like the lyric; The monster's gone, He's on the run And your daddy's here, ...
Aww that is really sweet. i did not realize how adorable the lyrics were.
They really are, what a nice show of affection to have if you are his son, or any son really.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles' song?
Tough call. I think it's a toss-up between Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da and Hello, Goodbye.
I think I was expecting something like Yesterday, but Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da?
Yeah, it's a really happy, catchy song.  I especially like the mistake when the names get switched.
Maybe I should listen to it again, I don't think I remember it that well.
You should, it's a good song.  What about you, what's your favorite?
No. It's Baby, You're a Rich Man.
Really?  Not All You Need Is Love?
I really like All You Need Is Love, but Baby, You're a Rich Man is just a weird, fun song.
Yeah, I guess it is.  It suits you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever given much thought as to what some of The Beatles songs mean?
Oh yes.  One of my favorites is Hey Jude -- A song Paul wrote for John Lennon's young son.
How did Paul come to write this song for Julian Lennon?  What do you think it means?
When John was leaving Julian's mother for Yoko Ono, the story goes that Paul wanted Julian to take it easy and try to get along with Yoko.
I Am The Walrus is a strange song by The Beatles.  Any idea what they are referring to with this song?
John Lennon wrote that song and I think he intentionally made it strange. I know the Walrus part refers to a Lewis Carroll poem.
Helter Skelter is a favorite although I have no real idea what it means.
For me personally, I think they are referring to a confusing relationship or situation in life. Everything became so frustrating for them.
What do you think they are referring to in The Long and Winding Road?  Is it sentimental to you?
Very sentimental!  I think it refers to their longevity.  Their music will live forever and never be forgotten.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you a fan of the Beatles?
I hear a lot about them, but I don't know many of their songs. They're a rock band, right?
Yes, but their music falls across a bunch of different genres. I think it would appeal to almost anyone.
Really? What are your favorite songs that don't get talked about?
There are a lot of them, like Hey, Bulldog, which is a really fun song that even some fans haven't heard
That sounds interesting. Why isn't it more well known?
I think because it's on their Yellow Submarine album, which is more like a soundtrack than a studio album
What other songs do you like?
It's hard to narrow it down, but check out Oh! Darling and Helter Skelter, two of their more heavy sounding songs
Interesting, and here I thought it was all cheesy pop-rock songs. I'll check those out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the Beatles are the greatest band of all time?
I would have to say yes. I can't think of a group that has had more incredible songs.
So true. Songs like All You Need is love just don't come out anymore.
Exactly. I don't think any other group is as well-known as they are either.
Yeah, I don't know of anyone who is unfamiliar with the Beatles.
What is your favorite Beatles album?
Probably A Hard Day's Night. Hard Day's Night is a great song too.
It definitely is. I think my favorite is Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
I don't think I've heard of that album. When did it come out?
It came out in 1967, after Revolver came out in 1966.
XXXXXXXXXXX
George Harrison seemed to be the quiet Beatle.
His lead guitar playing certainly wasn't quiet.
He has been listed as the 11th best guitar player by Rolling Stone Magazine
Didn't he study the sitar in India
He studied it for years with the master sitar player.  Again, as an innovator,  he introduced the sitar into music for the first time Rubber Soul in the song Norwegian Wood.
Did he write more songs for the Beatles?
George would often write a song and throw it in the pile to be recorded.  Often McCartney and Lennon were less than enthusiastic and it didn't make it on the album.
How about while My guitar Gently Weeps?
That was on the White Album, and Eric Clapton played the lead guitar.
I heard Something in the Way she moves is one of the top covered songs of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the song that made the beatles famous?
The first big song they had was love me do.
I don't think I even know that one.
Really? It is a bit more do-op like to me. cute lyrics very popular with the girls of course.
So that is what worked for the females in the 1960's. Seems so different from today.
The lyrics are much different. Today songs are much more obscene that first song love me do was very innocent and sweet.
I wonder who the sweetest beatle was?
I bet Paul with those baby blues hard not to see him as the sweetie.
Was he the youngest?
Not sure I know George Harrison was the oldest then John Lennon. So either paul or ringo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see John Lennon and Chuck Berry make a song together?
No, can you tell me more?
Yoko Ono interrupted them, it was quite funny.
What happened?
Chuck Berry and John Lennon played beautiful music together.
What did Yoko do?
She was making bad sounding noises and interrupting them.
Wow why did she do that?
Nobody knows for sure, but she probably wanted to be in the spotlight.
Wow I will have to watch that, it sounds funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was listening to Rain by the Beatles, earlier today.
Is that the one with the weird backwards vocals?
Yes, but it's not really that weird.
Really?
Yes, if you reverse it, it is basically just regular lyrics from the song.
That's actually kind of disappointing. I thought maybe it was about Paul being dead.
I sure if you tried hard enough you could tie it into the conspiricay.
Probably so. Anyway, I have always liked that song.
Me too. Ringo is really on top of his drum game with that one.
I agree. He was so underrated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey let's talk about music
Awesome
How about the beatles
They are a great band
Yes i enjoy their music
Me too
My favorite song is hey Jude
Thats a really good one
Its stuck in my head right now
Now its stuck in my head too
XXXXXXXXXXX
I didn't like the Beatles until I was an adult and discovered the song Rocky Racoon
That's funny. That is not one of their more popular songs.
I also like when they had their songs on that rockstar game
Oh, I liked that too. Especially she's so heavy.
Strawberry fields in a nice song as well.
I like to zone out and drive to that one.
What do you think of imagine?
I think it is a perfect song.
My birthday is the same day as Paul McCartneys
I don't like Wings as much as the Beatles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the greatest Beatles song of all time is?
I think Don’t Let Me Down is the greatest.
Why do you think Don’t Let Me Down is the greatest?
Because I like the rhythm track the best.
What about the rhythm track do you like?
I like the chord progressions.
What else do you like?
I like the way Ringo keeps time on the drums.
Do you wish the Beatles were still around today?
Yes, I do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like early or late Beatles better?
Late Beatles, definitely.
Same here. It's amazing how much they grew as songwriters.
Especially considering they were marketed as a kind of teen pop band.
Even then they were very talented, though. They wrote everything themselves.
Which is more than can be said for pop groups today.
And they played they're own instruments. Including live!
I remember their live harmonies are really good, actually.
They were always talented, they just needed the chance to show it.
The Beatles discography is an amazing journey in itself, really.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think John Lennon is a hypocrite?
He talks about no religion in the song Imagine,yet he was fascinated by it.
How so?
His Beatles are more popular than Jesus quote is the first example.
Well, that doesn't prove anything.
If you put that with him going to learn about more religion in India it adds up.
Still doesn't mean he is a hypocrite.
Add the line no possessions in Imagine with John being very rich it does.
Wow! Your narrative is totally different than the mainstream media`s.
Yep,because I tell the truth.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just listened to The Beatles on my iPod...their music is so great!
I know...classic.  I don't think anyone has been able to recreate what they had.
The Monkees were similar...but not as good.  You're right.
What is your favorite Beatles song?
"Hey Jude" but I also love John Lennon's "Beautiful Boy"  I sing that song to my son all the time.
Great songs!  I like some of their later music.
Like the Abbey Road album?
Exactly!  "Here Comes the Sun" just makes me smile.  I love that song!
I like "Come Together" probably the best off of that album.
That's a great song too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the Beatles best song?
I'd have to go with Come Together.
Great pick! Why do you think Come Together is their best song?
It has uniting message and a positive, upbeat tune. What are some of your favorite Beatles tunes?
Definitely Hello, Goodbye. I've loved it since I was a kid.
Oh yeah, Hello, Goodbye is great. Isn't it from a Beatles movie?
Yep, it is from the Beatles' magical Mystery Tour! Have you seen it?
I haven't. Is it good?
It is pretty good. It has other songs on it too like I Am the Walrus.
I will have to check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hello.
Do you like the Beatles?
Yes.
Who is your least favorite Beatle?
Least favorite?
Yeah like who do you think is just kind of whatever in the Beatles?
Well, probably Ringo.
Yeah I totally agree.
He wasn't that great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They were such a creative unique talent.
I know.  My whole family would end up singing things like Yellow Submarine and I am the Walrus at our get-togethers.
What do you think about the Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds song?  Do you think it was about drugs?
I don't know.  My Mom said that it was rumored it was about LSD --- Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Oh, you know my favorite --- The Long and Winding Road.   It was almost like church music.
I know, I heard that they only decided on adding the orchestra later on during the recording.
They had so much to say about the world and the whole culture they were playing for at that time.
I don't think we have anybody out there today that does quite the same thing at all.
They really were the beginning of a new era in music style.
There will never be another group like them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when they had that Beatles Anthology collection?
Yeah, I bought all the CDs!
When had that all come out?
Around 2000, I think.
Why did they release that collection?
I really don't know.
Was it just all their songs?
No, it was some songs, some live stuff, some outtakes.
Did you like it?
Yeah, I really did.  I found some songs I'd never heard of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your opinion on the song Hey Jude?
Oh, it's by that one band, the Beatles, right?
Yes! They are a classic, have you heard of the song?
Yes, I have they have a really nice ring to it. Didn't they perform that at the England's olympic?
Well, yes. It was only Paul McCartney though.
Ah. What happened to the others?
Well, one got assassinated and the others two are not as active as Paul is.
I see
I recommend you check out their Abbey Road album.
I will, thank you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love listening to The Beatles.
Oh me too.
What song?
Nowhere Man.
No way! That is my favorite!
What else do you like?
Think For Yourself.
Another great one!
I like Drive My Car too.
Same!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the Beatles music
Alright, they are such a classic band
I love hey jude
Me too, thats such a great song
It is, and yesterday is pretty good too
Yes it is.
I really like all their songs
Me too
Im going to pandora them now
I probably am also
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Beatles album do you like best?
I like Sergent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
That is a strange title where did that come from?
They did it as an alter ego band I think.
What song do you like best on it?
I like With a Little Help from my Friends.
That one is good.
I also like When I'm Sixty-Four and Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
They have many great songs.
Yes but this album is my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
With the Sgt.Pepper album cover some say it was creepy with occult overtones?
Most definately I could see why they are saying that.
Care to clarify?
Yes,well for one Aleister Crowley the godfather of Satanists was on that cover.
Wow! I could see why that album is a little creepy.
Speaking of creepy the wax models of the Beatles creeped me out on that cover!
Do you think having Aleister Crowley on the cover was really a sign that the Beatles were opening up the door to occultism?
Yes, this was a peak. Also Lewis Carrol who Crowley loved was also on that cover.
Who knew?Everybody back then thought the Beatles were innocent lads from Liverpool.
They were very far from four innocent lads from Liverpool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to a lot of the Beatles?
Actually, I guess I'm weird.  I never really saw the big deal with them.
I guess I feel the same way.
I do like some of their songs, but not any more than I like other group's songs.
So what songs do you like?
I guess my favorite would be "Jude".
Isn't that the one that they thought was written about drugs?
I've heard that.  I don't know.   I just like it because I think it sounds good.
I like it too.  I don't know of any other ones of theirs that I think too much about.
I know they did a lot of songs, but I feel that same way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard the Beatles were super into Indian music in the 60s. Trippy.
Yeah, I know some of their songs use sitar, but I think it really depends which ones you listen to how much it actually sounds like Indian music.
Oh?
Yeah, well the sitar on "Norwegian Wood" really just sounds like a guitar part to me, just played on the sitar.
True.
But if you listen to something like "Love You To," that has way more Indian influences. I think George had taken more lessons by that point.
What kind of Indian influences?
Drone, percussion, improvised bits, bent notes—lots of cool stuff!
Are there any other songs that used the sitar besides the Beatles?
Oh yeah, definitely. Listen to "Paint it Black" by the Rolling Stones!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yes, I love the Beatles. What about you?
I like their older songs. I like yesterday and Hey Jude.
I like more of their later songs. Revolution and you say it's your birthday are two of my favorites.
Oh, I don't like those as much.
That was when they started getting into more rock sounding music.
Yea. I just prefer the slower songs.
Alot of people like their earlier music.
Do you listen to them often?
Yes, I do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The more I learn about the beatles I think I like george harrison.
Oh ya why is that?
Well I have realized he was deeply spiritual. Had converted to hinduism.
That is cool.
He also is the one who wrote a lot of my favorite songs.
Which ones specifically?
While My Guitar Gently Weeps and my sweet lord are probably top two for me.
Those are good ones. Did he also write something?
Yes he did. that is really romantic song and I love it as well.
I find each member so talented and creative. Hard to say which one was my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like more of the Beatles earlier recordings, or did you prefer the later music?
Actually i liked some of the early stuff and some of the later material.  I definitely liked songs such as "I Want to Hold your Hand," but i also loved "Let it Be," and "Long and Winding Road."  So I liked early and later recordings.
Me too...I also liked a lot of the stuff that I guess could be called the "middle years."  I'm referring to albums like "Rubber Soul" and "Revolver."
I know what you mean.  You're talking about songs like "Yellow Submarine" and "Eight Days a Week."  great stuff!
What is your favorite Beatles album?
I'd say "Sargeant Pepper" is my favorite, but the "white album" is a close second.  I consider "Sgt. Pepper" a legendary album.
I actually remember the day i bought that album.  It had all those "cut outs" and pictures along with the actual record.  Of course this was during the days of vinyl records, long before compact discs.
Do you remember the album called "Magical Mystery Tour?" I don't think it was one of the more famous albums; it had some of their singles on it, and as i recall some pretty weird stuff.
I am familiar with that album.  "Magical Mystery Tour," in addition to being an album, was a not very successful television movie the group did.
No kidding; i didn't know that.  I think the song "Hello Goodbye" was on that album.  I really liked that song.  I enjoyed our chat about the greatest group ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did any of the Beatles have kids that followed in their footsteps?
I think John Lennon had a son.
What was his name?
Well, he had two sons, and I don't know if they are both musicians.
What are their names then?
Julian and Sean.
I never heard of them.
I know one of them looks a lot like John.
Does he sound like him?
I don't remember.  I saw him on TV once though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles album?
I only know individual songs, not albums.
Well, what song do you like?
I think my favorite is "She Loves You."
That was their second album, so really early.
What did they do later?
Well, their Abbey Road album is quite famous.
Oh yeah, I've seen the cover of them all crossing the street!
It's iconic! I think a lot of those songs were written individually and not together.
It's sad that they weren't as close as in the early days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I bet you don’t know the female Rnb group the Beatles performed with?
Was it the group they they stole I mean copied a hit song from?
What are you talking about? The group was a girl group from Motown Records.
There was a girl group from Detroit that had a hit song and the Beatles rerecorded it.
But did that group perform with the Beatles?
The group I’m thinking of was named the Marvellets and they had several hit records.
That’s not who I am thinking about but what was the name of the song?
“Please Mr. Postman was the name of the song. I’m sure they performed it together.
I’m not sure if the Beatles ever performed with the Marvellettes  but the Supremes sure did.
That's right and they made an album called "Live In Liverpool."
XXXXXXXXXXX
So,you don't think the Beatles were four lovable lads from Liverpool?
No way were they innocent!
Care to clarify?
They introduced mainstream druguse to the mainstream culture with LSD and MJ use.
So they were taking mind-altering drugs and the mainstream youthculture got influenced by them?
Yes, look at all those young males who wore long hair for about a decade because of the Beatles.
Back to the Beatles drug use,how bad was it?
Put it this way it was so bad John Lennon became a herion junkie.
Definately, Your narrative is so much different than the mainstream media`s.
The truth will set us free, and not mainstream`s narative.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that we could put on some music?
Sure, what do you want to listen to?
I'm actually in the mood to hear some of the Beatles, if that's okay.
Eh, any song in particular?
Hey Jude is always a classic!
I know everyone loves that song, but I really can't stand it.
Seriously? Well, which of their songs do you like, then?
I Want To Hold Your Hand is a nice one.
I thought you were going to say Yellow Submarine.
That one's fine, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's interesting how the Beatle's music changed after Yoko got involved with Lennon.
Interesting and sad.
To me, the music got less about talent and performance and more feeling driving.
Yeah, it seemed to wander quite a bit.
And then McCartney seemed to go his own way - he kept his talent up.
I was listening to some of his post Beatles music and it was just as good, it seemed, as the classic Beatle hits.
Yeah, it's hard to know. At their peak they were insanely popular.
I heard when they came to the States, they had tours with hardly any breaks between showings.
That's crazy! How did they manage?
Drugs, would be my guess. That and youth!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the earlier Beatles' music or the latter?
Do you mean the songs they did before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?
Yes, do you prefer their style of music like they played on Ed Sullivan or the more lyrical music?
I actually prefer some of the music from Rubber Soul, especially Norwegian Wood.
Rubber Soul paved the way for Sgt. Pepper's, I think, and had a mix of the old sound with the new.
You're right about that. Drive My Car sounded like it could have been on the Help album.
Yes, but I think their later music was influenced by their trip to India.
Absolutely! Dear Prudence on the White Album was directly inspired by their experience there.
They had a wide-ranging, ground-breaking sound.
They certainly did. And their many innovations can be heard in more modern groups, like 1990's band Oasis.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that movie last fall about the Beatles called "8 Days A Week?"
No, I missed that one.
It was about what it was like being on tour in the early sixties.
The sixties were supposed to be crazy.
What was crazy was they had footage in the film of their last live performance they found under some old lady's bed.
Wow, that's like those old cars they find in barns, or famous paintings at a Savation Army.
She heard they were making a movie and called them, and asked if they wanted some films she took of the concert.
She had some great films she was just hanging onto?
Actually, she never even developed them. The movie people had to restore them and found all this great stuff.
What better way to really hear songs than watch them actually being played by the band?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you a Beatles fan?
Not really. I think their music is too old. I know about Love me Do and the old-sounding stuff.
I don't think it's old-sounding! I like the later psychedelic stuff like Helter Skelter.
I'm actually into more 90's music.
I see. Do you like Oasis?
Yes, definitely!
Well, they are really into the Beatles, and you can hear the influence in their music.
Really? Maybe I should give them a try. What album do you recommend?
I'd start with the classic Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and then Rubber Soul.
My sister has Rubber Soul on CD. I'll give it a try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to the Beatles?
Who hasn't?  I love the Beatles.
What is your favorite album?
Mine has to be Sergeant Pepper.
Really?  I definately would have to go with Abbey Roads as my favorite.
I agree, Abbey Roads is a killer album.  What is your favorite song on there?
Probably "Here Comes the Sun".
Mine has got to be "Come Together".
That is a great Beatles tune.  There are just so many!
I know!  It is hard to choose just one favorite Beatles song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you like the Beatles?
A little
Why only a little?
I dont know too much about them
Oh okay, their music is awesome
I know the songs like Hey jude
Thats one of the best ones
I like it
You should get an album
Really
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking about that Beatles song, "Yesterday". I like the verse "yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away".
It's funny when your young how everything seems to be life or death.
Yeah, but when you look back you only remember the really good or bad times.
It's funny how a song can take you back to your past. I remember roller skating and the song "Don't let me down" was always playing.
I really liked "I want to hold your hand". Seems so tame to the lyrics the kids listen to today.
Isn't that the truth. I guess it does make one think of yesterday.
It really does. It seemed like a wild time but it was really so innocent.
Oh, to have back the innocence of our youth again. Life in the sixties and seventies times were a changing.
They don't have music like that anymore. Music that will be around and still make sense fifty years from now.
I don't know it may make sense to this generation and may make them smile when they hear it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Beatle?
I would say John.
Paul is my favorite.
The songs he wrote had great melodies, sure.
Yes. I like The long and Winding Road
Me too, but the non orchestral cut.
I agree. I fell in love with that version since I bought the anthology.
That's the best version.
George Martin was sometimes heavy handed on the orchestral bits.
There was less of that on John's song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Paul McCarthy wrote a song about his dog?
No, I didn't know that.  Which one?
Martha, My Dear.  He really loved his dog!
What kind of dog was it?
An Old English Sheepdog.
I think I heard he wrote Hey Jude for John Lennon's son.  Do you know if that's true?
Yes, John and his wife Cynthia were getting divorced and he wrote it for their son Julian.
What Beatles song is your favorite?
Oh, wow, that's a hard question.  Maybe Let It Be if I had to pick just one.
That's a great song for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Beatles?
Not really, I'm more of a Rolling Stones fan
They're great, but I think The Beatles have them beat, no pun intended.
Oh yeah? What are your favorite songs?
There's so many, but if you like the Stones then you should check out Day Tripper and Run For Your Life
Are they like All You Need is Love? I've heard that one, and I like it but it's not my favorite
Those songs are very different, as are a lot of their songs. They even have some heavier stuff like Helter Skelter and Back in the USSR
I haven't heard of those before. I wonder why they don't get any more attention?
I don't know, but the deeper you go into their catalogue, the more gems you'll find. It's like a bottomless well of amazing music, especially albums like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road
Alright, thanks for telling me! I'll give them a listen as soon as I can.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how many song do the Beatles have?
No I do know the exact number, but I know it´s more than 400.
Oh wow!. That is quite a few to remember. Which are your favorite.
Hey Jude, Let It Be, Help, Yellow Submarine, All You Need is Love, I think i have little 20 favorites.
I know, they are so amazing, they are still popular now a days.
Which was your favorite singer from the band.
I would have to say Paul McCartney, he still rocks my world.
Do you have any special songs about him with the Beatles?
Yes! It´s called Maybe I’m Amazed. What about you, what´s your favorite solo song of the Beatles?
I liked very much the song Mother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like when the Beatles cover other artists' songs?
Oh yeah, it's great to hear their spin on things.
I've been listening a lot to "Twist and Shout," because it's so upbeat.
Yes, that song puts you into a good mood no matter what.
Last week I was playing "Roll Over Beethoven" and I think I like it better than the Chuck Berry version.
I love Chuck Berry, so I don't know if I can say that, but The Beatles did a great job with it.
Then you have all the covers that have been done on Beatles' songs over the years.
There is too many to count, that would take years.
I used to like Aerosmith's version of "I am the Walrus," but I wore it out by listening to it too much.
That's a good one, but I think Frank Sinatra's cover of "Something" is superior.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Beattle?
Probably George Harrison. Why do you ask?
Because my mother in law is a hige beattles fan and i really want to impress her. I need to get to know as much as the Beattles as possible, so i can get those brownie points.
Well okay, i can try to help you out as much as I can. My mom is a Beattles freak as well. She could tell you anything you need to know about them.
Would you be willing to go to a Beattles concert with me and my inlaws?
Maybe, we will see. I think they're all either retired or not living right now. The only one who isn't retired is the main Beattle.
Okay we can do that. As soon as I get the money we can all go, can't wait to see the Beattle live and in action
Alright, i would love to hear "She Loves You" live and in action at a concert.
I bought all of their songs!
That's all i have in my house is Beattles and Bobby Brown vinyl records all up in my house. we can play them on my record stereo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can tell you something interesting
Sure what you got
Well it is a little known fact too
Yeah?
That after the beatles recored VI they had a show
Get out of here
No i am serious
What was it about
it had their music and stuff
That is interesting
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder why they have never made a collection
A collection of what
Like all the songs on one disc
Would that not be lame
Not at all
Why though
Because it would be convenient to have
I guess that is true
You know it
I cannot disagree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard the song "All You Need Is Love"?
The Beatles song, right?
Right. I was just thinking that that song is as relevant today as it was back then.
What do you mean?
Well, love really is all we need. It was true then, and it's definitely true now.
Agreed. The Beatles wrote some really insightful songs, didn't they?
They did! What I love about them is they covered the entire spectrum of human emotion.
That's definitely true. It's no wonder they're still so popular.
Yeah, part of that is due to an incredible amount of musical talent. But more than that, they put out songs that people could truly relate to.
I know. I should really listen to them more often
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever wondered what the song I Am the Walrus is about?
Yeah, I once heard that John Lennon wrote down a bunch of silly phrases and stuck them in a hat. He used those to write his song.
John Lennon seemed to write a lot of really strange songs, like Lucy in the Sky with Diamond.
Lucy in the Sky with Diamond was supposed to be based off a drawing his son Julian made.
I think John Lennon's songs are the best.
I really like George Harrison's songs, especially While My Guitar Gently Weeps.
You know who didn't write very many songs? Ringo.
Ringo didn't sing in many of the songs either.
Did you know that Ringo is left handed?
Paul McCartney was left handed too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Beatles are the greatest band of all time.
Well they have to be  up there.
Other than The Stones and maybe the Who I'd say they are in the top 3.
So many great songs.
I used to come home to hear my sister playing Sargeant Pepper album over and over and over.
I think I have every song on that album memorized.
I like some of their psychedelic stuff.
Strawberry fields?
Eleanour Rigby used to really depress me.
It is such a sad song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Are you familiar with the beatles?
Yeah sure.
Who is your favorite of all of them?
I like John.  What about you?
I am a fan of Paul.
They were the best two I think.
I would agree with that.
Good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's your favorite Beetles song?
That's hard to say. I am very fond of several of them.
Well, tell me one of them.
Okay, I have always really liked "Hey Jude".
I love that song, such a sad and beautiful meaning.
Can you remember who wrote "Hey Jude"
I think Paul McCartney wrote most of it but it is also credited to John Lennon on the album.
Did you know it was originally called "Hey Jules" and was changed before it was released?
No, I had never heard that before, very interesting.
It was called "Hey Jules" because it was originally written for Julian Lennon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you much of a Beatles fan?
I am. I love all of their songs and music.
I'm the same way. Favorite Beatles Album?
I would have to go with Abbey Road. So many classic hits on one album.
I agree, but I would have to pick the White Album. I like the songs on that one a litte bit better.
Yea, I like that one too. You have a favorite song by The Beatles?
I think so. It would have to either Blackbird or Imagine.
Didnt John Lennon write and sing the song Imagine?
I guess you are right. My favorite song would have to be Blackbird then.
My favorit song is Yellow Submarine. Such a catchy song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think of the Beatles?
I don't know much about them. I think they are not from my mother's generation.
You might have heard their music somewhere, in the bar, parties, etc.
Yes, can you sing something that I might have heard?
Can'y buy me love...love....
Oh I know that one. Do you know another one?
Twist and shout! Baby baby baby...
I am not sure about that, but the melody sounds familiar.
You should check Beatles out. They are really cool.
I hope they are still giving concerts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the White Album?
It's perfect.
Really? I don't like it.
Are you nuts?
It has too many songs.
But they're all good.
No they aren't. They could've left off a few.
But then it wouldn't be the White Album.
I just find myself skipping a lot of songs.
I love them all and so do most people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What year did the Beatles get their start?
I think it was around 1960, they were from Liverpool England.
Are any of them still alive? I remember when John Lennon was shot and killed.
Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney are still alive. I think George Harrison died a couple years ago from cancer.
I wonder how many records they've sold worldwide.
It's got to be over 1 billion. They were famous worldwide.
Do you have a favorite album? I always liked Rubber Soul.
That was a great album, In My Life was one of the most beautiful songs ever written.
Between Paul and John, which one do you think is a better songwriter?
That's debatable, they were both great songwriters. When they worked as a songwriting team, they were even better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you think there are some magic in the lyrics of The Beatles?
yea, I think most of the lyrics in their songs are well thought and trying to spread out a positive message to the world
yeah, I'm so glad a band like that exist
yeah, what are some of your favorite songs from them>
They really have tons of great songs, I particularly like Let It Be
what a surprise, that's my personal favorite asd well
I just feel a song like that is good for a lot of occasions, when I'm down I also listen to them
That would make you feel much better, doesn't it
oh yeah, I hope The Beatles still publishing songs
but I'm afriad time passed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i miss the beatles
me too my pops play them like crazy
my uncle turned me on to them
you did'nt know of them
i did but i learned to love there music
why you say that, and whats a good tune from them you like
man i like all of them i haven't heard one i don't like
the where the worlds best group would you say
they made alot of people happy in those days
yeah my dad said he made a baby of one of the beatles album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know The Beatles are one of my favorite bands, right?
Of course, you have like all their albums!
Yes! I was just listening to the Beatles Anthology.
Okay, what is that exactly? Is it like a collection of The Beatles works?
Yeah,  a documentary and whole history and collection of their work with unreleased songs and stuff like that.
Wow, that's really cool. Are there songs you hadn't heard before on it?
Yeah, some of John Lennon's songs he was working on before he got killed.
Wow, that's really cool. What are they called?
Well, one is called "Free as a Bird." It's a really good song, but kind of sad too.
Yeah, John Lennon died way too young. He was a great songwriter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you buy all the remastered albums that came out in 2009?
Yeah, it took me over a year to get them all.
Can I borrow "Meet the Beatles!", I've never listened to the whole thing.
Oops, sorry I didn't keep that one. I bought it, kept for a year and then I gave it away.
How come?
I only liked two or three songs from that album and since they were also in one of their greatest hits album, there was no reason for me to keep it.
Was that their first album?
I believe that was their first album released in the US, but in the UK I think they released "Please Please me" first.
Let's listen to "Please please me" then.
Okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Beatle?
Oh, that's tough. I guess it is John.
Do you think that Paul was a great bassist?
Absolutely. He is underrated.
What's your favorite Beatles' album?
Mine is "Rubber Soul."
Do you think that the Beatles are the greatest group ever?
I do. The Who is the second greatest.
Do you like "Eleanor Rigby"?
I do.It's beautiful and touching.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Sgt. Pepper is 50 years old.
Yeah, I guess it is. They're releasing a new version of it now.
Oh, really? Did they work Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane back into it somehow?
No, they didn't. That would have been the smart thing to do, right?
Guess I'll just stick with my own playlist, then! The album doesn't really work so well without them.
I know what you mean. I mean, there are some neat experiments in there, but there's not much that really stands out until the end.
A Day in the Life, you mean?
Right. But even that... honestly, the Paul segment could go. I don't know what else to do with it, but oy.
Yeah, there's that great climax of sound, and then... doopy doopy doo, I'm Paul McCartney; aren't I a fop!
I keep blending that transition in my mind with Bohemian Rhapsody. It's an improvement.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any Beatles albums?
I don't own any albums but I am a fan of their work
Oh really? Whats your favorite song?
I love Hey Jude
The original studio version or a re-release
Just the original one!
Cool, you should check out their other stuff
what do you recommend
Some of their old stuff. I want to hold your hand is a good starter
Cool I'll check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you bought sgt peppers 50th anniversary album yet?
No,I've heard and read a lot about it though.
It's unreal. New clips and it comes with a DVD.
Wow,no kidding?
Yes it does. I can't get enough of the Beatles.
Me too,they changed music.
That they did. That album was groundbreaking!
It was a classic and still is.
Wasn't a big hit at first though.
Yea,people weren't used to that music from the Beatles. It was out of the norm.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Beatles, how about you? They are one of my favorite bands.
Mine as well, what are some of your favorite songs? I always liked the early songs, Love Me Do, I wanna Hold you hand and the  others that made the first become popular.
I really love the album Sargent Pepper, now that has some great songs like Lucy in the Sky.
Yes that is a great record! No one can beat their songs. Who was your favorite beatle?
John Lennon. Now he was a great composer. Just think of all the songs he would have written if he was not killed. Such a horrible tragedy.
I agree, Paul McCartney also came out with a lot of good songs.
I love Hey Jude, Get Back, Yellow Submarine, Norwegian Wood, and a lot more.
Those are some of my favorite as well as a lot of George Harrison songs.
They were all talented, you cannot find a band that rivals them. They were real trendsetters.
You are right. No one today can hold a candle to them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Paul McCartney turned 75 years old recently?
Who is Paul McCartney?
He was in the Beatles. He was the bass player and singer of popular songs like "Yesterday" and "Michelle".
Oh, I remember those songs! Didn't he also write songs?
Yes, he wrote songs with John Lennon. They're considered one of the greatest music writing pairs of all time.
I remember so many Beatles songs. I've also seen a cover band that was very good playing their music.
They also had movies they made, such as "Help!" and "Hard Day's Night". "Yellow Submarine" was also made into a movie.
I remember those! I loved watching those movies. They seemed to have so much fun together.
They were definitely one of the greatest bands of all time. Their music is timeless.
Yes, they were. It's nice that Paul is still around to play some of the old favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles album?
Definitely Revolver.
That one is too weird for me.
Oh, really?
Yes, way too "out there" for me.
Are you more of the Rubber Soul type?
How did you know?
Your favorite song is Norwegian Wood.
What can I say?
It's a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think the beatles think of shows like Love in vegas?
I am sure paul mccartney has some opinion. He is still alive.
I did not realize that. My bad. I wonder if he likes it.
I would think yes but who knows. I can't believe you thought he was dead.
I think of them as such an older band. They really epitomized the 60s.  I just thought they must all be dead now.
He is old but kicking. he is actually father of stella mccartney the fashion designer.
I did not know that either. I like her work but out of my price range generally.
Ringo Starr is still alive a swell. Though much less public than paul.
Really? wow I had no idea. I like ringo.what about george?
Harrison died in 2001 , I think it was cancer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what it would have sounded like if the beatles had reformed after lennin
They would have not done such a thing
But it is a what if you know
Well i guess
I mean they could have sounded different
Which could be bad
or very good you know
Well who would fill in
I do not know their is so many talented musicians though
Well i guess thats correct
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what song is always beautiful to me?
What song?
'Eleanor Rigby.'
There was definitely such a unique quality about that one.
Did you know that it was one of the first songs by them that isn't sang in a first person perspective?
Now that you mention it, there were no "I's" or "me's" in that song at all.  At least not that I can recall.
It also really resonated with me.  And so many others.
I could definitely also relate to that sort of loneliness they sang about.
Exactly.  Sad, but also universal concepts.
That gave it depth and made it all the more beautiful, like you said earlier.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a beatles fan?
Yeah for sure, who isn't?
I mean, not everyone is....
That's surprising.  THey are pretty classic.
Who's your favorite Beatle?
That's a funny story actually.  Paul is my favorite, but I named my daughter after a different one.
Oh yeah?  Who's that?
Lynnon.... after John Lennon
Interesting!  What's your favorite song?
Blackbird
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when the Beatles came to America.
Sure, it was on the television.
I remember all of the boys started growing out their hair.
Yeah, I remember singing "she loves me yah yah yah".
That song was really popular.
I heard Elvis liked the Beatles music.
I heard that too. I think he met them.
I really had a crush on Paul.
I thought Ringo was so cool.
I like the British accent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Today I listened to the White Album by the Beatles.
The Beatles are great I enjoy their music.
Do you listen to them often?
Not really but when I hear their music I really like it.
I listened to the whole album start to finish.
What was your favorite song
I really like the song Blackbird.
I like that one too it's really different.
I'm going to search for some more classic Beatles music.
Now I"m going to listen to the White Album!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
I don't know many songs, but I like them.
What songs do you know? The major hits?
Yeah, like Help, All You Need Is Love, etc.
Great songs. I think All You Need Is Love should be the world anthem.
That would be great! What are your favorite Beatles songs?
I really like I Wanna Hold Your Hand and She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
The Bathroom Window? Now that is funny! I've never heard that one.
It's such a great song! They have so many original titles and lyrics.
I will have to listen to that one for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey girl, do you like the Beatles?
Sure, why not?
What's your favorite song?
"She Loves You"
That's a good one.
What's your favorite song?
I like "Penny Lane"
I like that one too.
Yes, we should listen together sometimes.
Okay, that'd be nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ringo didn't sing many of the Beatles songs, did he?
Only eleven of them.
Do you know any of them?
Yellow Submarine is one of them.
That is such a fun song.
He did another fun one called Octopus garden.
I'm not familiar with that one.
It was on the Abbey Road album.
I don't know that album very well.
You probably know some of the other songs from the album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Musically speaking, who do you think the most talented Beatle was?
Wow, that's a hard choice. Every member of the Beatles was incredibly gifted.
True, though I've always had a soft spot for John Lennon. His songwriting skills were unparalleled.
That's true, but didn't he write most of them with Paul McCartney?
Yes, he did while he was with the Beatles. His solo stuff is just as good though, and Paul obviously wasn't around for that.
I see your point. "Imagine" really is an amazing song.
I think my second favorite in terms of musical talent is George Harrison.
Really? Most people seem to go for John or Paul.
Well, George wrote and sang "Here Comes the Sun", "Something", and "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Those are three of the Beatles greatest songs.
He did all three of those? Wow, he really doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, does he?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the first time you heard the beatles?
Yes, on the radio in 1964.
Me, too. I heard "I Want to Hold Your Hand".
That was a good one, but I like "She Loves Me" better.
The music from their movie "Hard Day's Night" was pretty good, too.
I thought it was a step backwards--or at least it was not innovative.
Surely not as much as the 'Sgt. Pepper's' album.
I still listen to that album at least once a month.
I think the "White Album" was the strangest album they made.
Yeah, "No. 9" was beyond belief.....
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Beatles. Don't you.
Of course I do!
What is your favorite album by them?
I love the Red Album.
Oh really? That is very interesting.
I love the song Love Me Do.
I love the song Please Please Me.
Another great song!
Well it was nice talking to you!
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like the Beatles and their music?
Sure its okay.
Would you call yourself a fan?
Yeah, but I don't know very much about them.
I'm kind of the same.
Do you have a favorite beatle?
I like paul. You?
I like john.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the original name of the Beatles was the Silver Beetles?
No, I did not know that.
Yes, It was before they came to America for the Ed Sullivan Show.
I remember watching that. They sang several songs.
Yes they did. I remember them singing I want to Hold Your Hand.
Yea and All my Loving too.
I think they also did I saw her standing there but not sure.
That was a great show. They were all dressed in their suits.
And they all had that hairstyle they made so famous.
Yea, nothing can beat that era.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I've been listening The Beatles a lot lately....
Oh, yeah? I love them. Which albums?
Sgt. Pepper's -- very trippy album!
Haha, yes! The songs are really great though.
What do you think Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds is about?
Well, I've read some people think it's about drugs but John Lennon said it was about a drawing his son made.
Oh, wow that's interesting. I didn't know that!
Yeah, John's son drew a picture of a woman flying and said her name was Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
That's cool he got his songwriting inspiration from his son!
Yeah, that's a good song! I also love A Day in the Life from that album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles fan?
I like a lot of their songs, but I don't think I know nearly enough to consider myself a fan.
I'm assuming you have Beatles 1 then?
Exactly.  I know their greatest hits.
Those are some of their best songs.  Though if you are counting their best, you should remember 'Norwegian Wood.'
I don't know that one.
It was written by John Lennon.
What is it about?
It's about a person's brief love with a stranger.
Wait, this sounds familiar.  I think George Harrison played the sitar for this song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Beatles song?
Not really, maybe Let It Be, what about you?
I really like Helter Skelter.
Well I guess we're both McCartney fans!
Ha, absolutely. They were all so talented
Even Ringo?
Yeah, even Ringo!
I actually think George Harrison was the most talented
I agree, he's so underrated
Brilliant guitarist - he was just a laid back guy and personality compared to the rest
XXXXXXXXXXX
where can i find some beatles clothing and cd's
you should search online
i would'nt know where to look
that group is out dated but they should still have clothes online
i think i might go to the mall and find something
the mall could get you clothes of the beatles
yeah my cousin just told me to try the little store in there
the store by the pizza shop has lots of beatles cd's and posters and clothes
thanks i'm going to go pick up some beatles gifts you wanta come
sure i could use a few more beatles tee shirts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that this year is the 50th anniversary of the Sgt Peppers album?
Yeah, I saw a special on PBS. It was a ground breaking album.
Rolling Stone magazine has consistently rated it as one of the top rock albums ever.
I know. "A Day in the Life" is one of the songs that always gets analyzed. The chord at the end lasts for something like 2 minutes.
Everybody covered "With a Little Help from My Friends". That was a great song.
Ringo did a great job singing that one. Joe Cocker covered that song at Woodstock in 1969.
George's song "Within You Without You" was the song that had a lot of Indian influence and made me finally appreciate the sitar.
Agreed! That was one of George's best songs. I thought McCartney's "Lovely Rita" was another great song on that album.
Oh yes! I love that song too. I like the ending where Lennon is making that sound as the song reaches a crescendo.
Man, the Beatles were the best group ever! There will never be another group like that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I LIKED THE BEATLES FIRST RECORDINGS WHEN THEY SANG OUR OLD ROCK AND ROLL HITS
I SAW THE BEATLES IN CLEVELAND
THE COPS STOPPED THE SHOW AND THEN THEY LET IT CONTINUE
I THINK THE BEATLES WERE TOO INTO DRUGS AND EASTERN PHILOSOPHY
NOBODY LIKED YOKO ONO
THEY SAY SHE BROKE UP THE GROUP
TOO BAD GEORGE AND JOHN ARE GONE
WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE RINGO AND PAUL
PAUL"S SECOND WIFE WAS A GREEDY GOLDDIGGER
LUCKILY THE BEATLE'S MUSIC WILL LAST FOREVER
XXXXXXXXXXX
OK, favorite Beatles song. Go!
Hmm, I really like Eleanor Rigby
That one? For real?
What's wrong with Eleanor Rigby?
It's a little sad, no? I'm more a Sgt. Pepper person myself.
I like the dark tone. It's very poignant.
I suppose. What record is that one again?
Yellow Submarine!
Oh yeah, have you seen the movie? We should watch it!
Let's do it!

Abbey road is the last album where all 4 beatles were part of the recording.
well, that should be the case, but they released Let it be after Abbey Road.
But Let it be was all recorded before Abbey Road.
That's what I'm saying It should considered the group's last recorded album.
But it's not because the record company messed up.
I don't know if they messed up or intended all along.
Either way it's stupid. Abbey Road IS the last album
Well at least the latest recordings from the Beatles.
And that's all that matters.
At least both albums are good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatle's song?
"Yesterday"
Oh yeah, that's a great song.
I always think of old times when I hear it.
It definitely brings back memories.
That's right, just like the song suggests.
That song takes me back to another time.
I know what you mean, I feel the same.
I experience the emotions of that time and space, when I hear it.
Ahh, the good old days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm looking to buy a CD for my dad's birthday. What do you think I should get?
Get him a Beatles CD.
Do you really think he will like that?
Of course! Everyone his age would. They were legends back in the day.
Great idea! I actually like them too.
I like them, but I can't say I really know much of their music.
You must know at least Hey Jude.
Yea, I think everybody knows that one!
True. In any case, my father will know all!
All of his baby-boomer friends will want to borrow his CD!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So where do you fall on the Beatles vs. Stones debate?
The Stones, but both are bands one should respect.
I think so too. I'm more of a Beatles fan personally.
I think they had a couple of very good songs, but I just can't get into them that much.
Have you tried Revolver?
I have, but it didn't really do it for me.
What about their solo material?
Well I think Paul did some good stuff.
You should check out George Harrison's solo material. It's very underrated.
That's for the recommendation!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What types of songs did you like that the Beatles played.
Their early songs were mostly love songs like "She Loves You"
Then as time went on there were ballads like "Yellow Submarine" and others
They went from mostly love songs to more social and songs of rebellion, mostly covert in nature.
The worst was when the madman Charles Manson thought that the Beatles album Abbey Road was a call to a violent revolution and he started his horror show.
It was awful, the music was all about peace and loving one another, like in "Hey Jude"
They became a little bizarre with some of their impressions from drug use, like "Yellow Submarine"  as they must have been really stoned to write that song.
It was too bad that success started to break them up. creative differences and ideas and the like.
I loved songs like "Yesterday"  It has to be one of the most beautiful songs ever written.
I agree, they had such a wide range of talents and songs, many still sung today, most highest selling of all time i think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
my dad is playing all this old music
what kind of music
the beatles he loves them
he has good taste

i like a couple of there songs

What genre are they anyway
Im not sure ive heard rock and pop
So i guess pop rock
Sure that sounds good
Better thsn anything else
Yea pretty much
Pop rock aounds good
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you have always liked the Beatles.  Which member has been your favorite?
I have always appreciated Ringo's drumming abilities and I like it when he sings.
Yes, I really liked when he sang "Act Naturally".  Do you recall any songs by George?
When he set out on his own, I really liked "My Mind Set on You" and "Here Comes the Sun".
I liked those as well.  In the early days it was mostly Paul and John doing all the singing.
You can't beat the early songs -- "She Loves You" and "She Was Just Seventeen".
I remember their early days on TV.  What did your family think of their singing?
My father was flabbergasted!  He had never heard of such a thing.  He couldn't believe I actually liked them.
My whole family was glued to the TV.  I remember the audience screaming during "All My Loving".
Yes, and the program put each of their names on the TV screen.  For John, they put "Sorry girls. He's married."!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the deepest Beatles song?
I think Revolution is the deepest.
I think it is great. The lyrics are awesome.
What other song do you think is deep?
With a Little Help From My Friends.
Who sings that one?
Ringo Starr
Is he the drummer?
Yes
He is awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the beatles are the greatest band of all time?
I don't know about that, they have some great hits but the best band ever is a hard title to win!
Come on, who else could have had EVERYONE at the superbowl singing one song like McCartney did with Hey Jude?
That's true! But for every song like Hey Jude that the Beatles had they also had songs like Taxman which were kind of mediocre.
Fair point, however the number of good songs of theirs far outweigh the number of bad.
Don't get me wrong I love the Beatles! I always put on the Revolver album when I need a pump up in the car.
That's a great call, for me I put on the 1's Album and just go back to their hits. Its refreshing and brings me back to a simpler time.
A simpler time? The Beatles wrote about some heavy content. Lady Madonna might sound like a nice and light song but its very deep and emotional.
True but for some reason their voices just relax me. I mean three of the greatest musicians of all time in one band? We'll never see anything like that again.
You mean John, Paul, and George? Thats fair. I guess the Beatles could be considered the best band ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who the best band ever is?
Well, thats pretty bold. But sure, tell me.
The Beatles. Without a doubt, hands down the best band ever.
Well, it would be hard to argue with you there.
I mean, there is not other band that influenced a generation so much.
Not just a generation, they are still influencing people today.
There music just speaks to people in all walks of life.
It is a shame that they broke up when they did.
Who knows, it may have been for the best.
I guess it was just there time to end. They had a good run.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your whole take on the pre-Sgt. Pepper versus post-Sgt. Pepper Beatles?
Oh, you mean the whole short hair versus long-hair thing they did?
Kind of, but...including the change in their music style...
Well, remember...their manager Brian Epstied OD'ed around that time...
Yeah, tragically true...but...hmmm....you know, their overall style was evolving prior to losing Epstein.
They were all doing LSD and other drugs.  Today everything they were doing would be considered absolutely illegal, but back then....  all the uppers, hallucinogens, other stuff...who knows...it helped fuel some creative drive, and it wasn't really against the law yet...  But, yeah, drugs had some influence, I think.
Maybe also they had experienced so much in such a short time.  Maybe something within John, Paul, George and Ringo collectively changed with their common experiences of being on the road, doing everything together, etc.  The insanity of it all--of Beatlemania--maybe that did something to them and had something to do with their shift in styles...
Could be...or maybe it was who they were with.  They were all in serious relationships with girlfriends and wives at that point...
True...that could have made some of a difference in their style changes...  Just fascinating.  Wish we could know 100% for sure.  It would be amazing if we could just bottle up the essence of their overall magic...
Paul and Ringo are still around...  Wish we could get ALL their secrets somehow...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Kind of.
What do you mean?
I mean, I like some of their songs. Like Across The Universe and Blackbird. But I just never really listened to them.
You should really give their albums a try! A lot of their music is on Spotify.
I might check out some of their stuff. Are you a big fan or something?
Definitely. I pretty much grew up listening to The Beatles.
How'd you even find them? They were popular before you were born.
Yeah, but my dad was really into them. He's the one that got me into them in the first place.
That's cool. Maybe he had some of their old records then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the beatles
Okay great
Whats your favorite song
Mine is yesterday
I like that one
Whats your favorite song
Dont let me down
Thats a good one too
They are all good
Yes they are
XXXXXXXXXXX
I met someone today who was so far out there I think he could've written songs for the Beatles.
What do you mean?
Well you know how some of the Beatles lyrics are hard to make sense of, or they don't seem to mean anything at all?
I don't think so. I thought mostly they did love songs and things like that.
They've done love songs and they've done just some far out there songs.
Examples?
Like Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Octupus's Garden come to mind.
I thought Maxwell's Silver Hammer was kind of morbid, didn't you?
Not especially. I always just found it amusing and lighthearted.
It seems like just the kind of song you'd like.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your thoughts on the Beatles song let it be?
One of my favorites. Like the story behind it.
Imagine having a dream about your mother and waking up and writing a hit song about the dream.
That's a talent for sure.
I know ther was a lot of dissension making the album let it be,but I still think it's one of their best.
I agree. Yoke was a big problem in the studio.
She was always there which was unusual for the Beatles. No outsiders were ever in the studio before .
She was a constant that rubbed the other Beatles the wrong way.
Especially paul!
Hahahahah that's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you have any thoughts on the Beatles?
I loved them, and was there to meet them on their first trip to the US.  The girls were actually fainting they were so excited.
That must have been something.  What was their music like?
They  played their popular songs and really thrilled the crowd.  I loved hearing them sing a mix of songs.  They were so cool.
They patterned some of their stuff from some of the work by Buddy Holly I think.
Sure thing, he influenced them while they were coming up with some tours Holly did in England.
Well they certainly had a huge influence on the music industry and Rock n' Roll.  So many groups patterned after them and their success.
Their hair styles caught on and soon long hair was popular with younger men and high heeled boots were the craze too.
My sister had a Beatles bobble head set and still has it.  I think it is pretty valuable, like a family heirloom, ha ha.
The Beatles certainly had a huge influence from their run and still are popular today so many years later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Beatle do you think had the best solo career.
I'd need a minute to think about that. Do you have an answer ready?
Yeah, I think that it's definitely John Lennon. Plastic Ono Band is one of my all-time favs.
That's a great record. As far as number of quality releases, it's hard to argue with Paul having the best career.
I don't know. Paul has so much mediocrity and overly commercial stuff.
That's true, but the sheer number of great albums, with the Wings and with Linda, like Ram, surely put him first.
Well, I do think John Lennon had the best solo career, but the question of best solo Beatle album is different.
Indeed. My favorite is Ram by Paul McCartney.
That is a very off kilter album for Paul, I can see why you'd like it. George Harrison's double album All Things Must Pass is my favorite.
Oh man! I forgot about that one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles song?
There's too many to choose from. I like Don't Let Me Down a lot!
That's a great one. Do you know what album that song is from?
Let It Be, of course! What is your favorite song?
Can't Buy Me Love is my current favorite, but I kind of alternate.
Same here, I love pretty much anything Beatles.
Do you have a favorite album?
It's a tie between Abbey Road and Rubber Soul
What about the white album?
Oh yeah! A three way tie then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who were the original members of the Beatles?
The original band members were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best.
When did Ringo Starr join the band?
Ringo replaced Pete Best as drummer in 1962.
Oh, that's interesting. And when did Stuart Sutcliffe leave?
He left a few months before Pete Best because he decided to return to university.
That's interesting. You never really hear about the other two in the band before Ringo.
Yeah, none of their really big hit songs were made during that time so maybe that's why.
That makes sense. Either way, I'm glad they ended up with the members they did.
Me too. Those four were all very talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hello.
Do you know who the Beatles are?
Sure of course.
Do you have a favorite beatle?
I like George Harrison the best.
That is a good choice.
Really tragic how he passed, but he lived such a cool life.
I agree.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
And "I feel fine" used audio feedback.
Yep, which another innovative technique used by the beatles.
That was the very first time feedback was used as a part of a recording and performance.
Yep. McCartney A string is feeding to Lennon's guitar which is what's causing the feedback.
One of my favorite songs
Mine too. It's catchy, good vocal harmony, funny words.
He buys her diamond rings, you know, she said so.
Except that line. She's a gold digger.
Well, that's the best line...
Best line... about a gold digger.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the Beatles first become popular?
It was the early 1960s.
That's when they first became popular in America, right?
Yeah, I want to say they were on TV in February of 1963 and that was it.
What show were they on?
They were on the Ed Sullivan show.
Oh, I rememeber seeing that.
Yeah, I've seen that footage before.
The girls were all going crazy, right.
Yeah, and homes all through America were tuned in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the song "In My Life"?
Yeah, that is a great Beatles song.
Who sings it?
John and Paul
They have a great band. What album is that song on?
Rubber Soul
Oh, that is a good album
There are tons of classics on that one
Can you name on besides In My Life?
Girl
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first song ever recorded by the Beatles?
Well, the first song they ever recorded was a cover of That'll be the Day. This was way back when they were known as The Quarrymen.
OK, but that was a cover. What about an original song? What was their first original release?
Well, that would be the song Love Me Do. It was released in 1962.
Which Beatle wrote that song, do you think?
I am pretty sure it was written by McCartney. I think I read somewhere that he wrote it in the late fifties when he was playing hooky from school!
It was an awesome song. It was released as a single with the song P.S. I Love You, which I didn't like as much.
Really? I love that song, too. Even though it was on the B side!
Yeah, well, the single only got to number 17 in the United Kingdom. When it as released in the United States, I think it got up to number 4.
Fans in the U.S. must have liked the songs a lot more than the Brits, then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Beatle?
John Lennon
Why is John Lennon your favorite?
He did a lot of writing and I love what he did post-Beatles.
I agree. He had a message like no other. What is your favorite Beatles song that John wrote?
He wrote Because, and that is my all time favorite song.
I love that song! It is so relaxing.
Yes! I think Paul wrote more songs than John but the ones John wrote were just so magical.
The Beatles in general are magical!
Magical Mystery Tour!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The band director just gave us our theme for the next football game. I know you're going to love it.
What's the theme?
The Beatles. They're one of your favorite bands, right?
I love their music! What songs will you be playing?
I don't know all the songs we're playing, we haven't got our music packets yet. I do remember the songs; Yellow Submarine, Hey Jude, and All You Need is Love.
Those are some of their more of their well known songs.
Which of their songs do you like?
I like most of their songs; but my favorites are Paperback Writer, Eleanor Rigby, We Can Work it Out, and Come Together.
I'll let you know when I get the packet. We can listen to the songs together.
We can listen at my house. I have my dad's old record player, and several of their albums.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
I love them! I used to listen to them when I was young; my uncle gave me a bunch of their albums.
What's your favorite?
Probably the White Album. I know that's an unusual choice, probably. It's so weird and experimental.
Not me, I found that too weird for my taste. I like their earliest stuff. So sweet, melodic and romantic.
I dig it. But for me when they started to get more...I don't know, spiritual and psychedelic, that's when they got really interesting.
Hmm. I do tend to like a band's "experimental stage." Like, if they are talented enough, eventually they start to really push the envelope in their own way.
True. For the Beatles I think it was maybe Revolver that was the turning point there, or maybe Sgt. Peppers'.
I did really love Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, one of the greatest albums of all time.
They were a true gift to music, for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite album by the Beatles?
I like a lot of them.     Maybe that new one, Seargent Pepper.
That is a very cool album.    Maybe check out the one before it.
What is the name of the album?
It is called Revolver, and has an all black and white cover.
That is quite different to Seargent Pepper.     Why would I like it?
That records are similar.     Lots of horns and classical and Indian instruments.
OK.    I like stuff that does not all sound the same.    Songs?
Well, you might have heard of Eleanor Rigby or Tomorrow Never Knows.
Yes, I know those.     That last one was the one on that Mad Men episode.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do the Beatles and the Jackson 5 have in common?
That's a good trivia question. Lets see, they both appeared on the Ed Sullivan show.
Good start but can you think of anything else?
They both had successful Saturday morning cartoon shows.
Keep going, your pretty good with this.
The Beatles and Jackson 5 both had lead singers who ventured out on their own.
I had not that about that one but that's good. Keep going.
Both the Beatles and the Jackson 5 have won Grammy awards for their group work.
One more and your lunch is on me.
The lead singers of both The  Beatles and The Jackson 5 won Grammys as a  individuals as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to the Beatles live?
No,they stopped touring before I was old enough.
Yea,me too.
Would have loved to see them live!
I know,a lot of screaming though!
Oh god,the girls screaming throughout.
That's why they stopped touring.
Oh I didn't know that.
Yea,they couldn't hear themselves singing.
Wow,it had to be incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles at all?
Not really.
That is too bad.
Do you like them?
Of course, they are amazing!
What song do you like?
I like Eleanor Rigby.
You find that catchy?
Yes.
Well that is cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know I've never listened to The Beatles?
What? Are you joking?
Nope! Dead serious.
Not even, on accident or something? They play on the radio all the time!
Nah man, I only listen to Top 40.
Yikes...that's a choice.
Okay whatever, enough judgement. Which Beatles songs would you recommend?
I guess my favorite would have to be Piggy's.
This was a trick, man! I love The Beatles and you just picked their worst song.
Aw what the heck man? Not cool! Piggy's is a good song...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What songs do you like that the Beatles' wrote?
I don't like the very early stuff but I like the stuff like Sergeant Pepper's album?
Which song do you like?
I like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and many others.
Wasn't that about taking LSD?
People think it is but it is actually not true.
Oh, why do you say that?
Lennon said it was about his daughter's drawing.
Oh what was the drawing?
It was a drawing about a girl named Lucy with diamonds in the sky in the picture.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like the beatles?
Yes they are classic
I love their song hey jude
That one is good
When did it come out
In 1968 i think
Its wierd these songs are so old but people still love them
Yea i know
They were just a really good band
I kmow
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite rock group of all time?
That's gotta be the Beatles.
Why are they the all time favorite?
Not sure why, maybe just because everyone knows them the most. They had a good share of media coverage.
So what happened to the Beatles?
Unfortunately, half of the band has passed away. John Lennon was murdered by a crazyman back in 1980 and George Harrison died of lung cancer back in 2001.
Why would anyone want to do away with someone like that?
Mark David Chapman killed John Lennon because he said he was jealous of the Beattles and wanted to be "somebody" like the Beatles. The Beatles' fame got him upset, so he shot and killed the Beatles' main leader, John Lennon
That's a shame. Will the Beatles ever make a comeback?
Not looking good for a comeback. Ringo Starr looks contently retired with  hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank, and Paul McCartney seems to have little to no motive to reform the Beatles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best Beatles Album?
For me it would have to be Let it Be
The last album they made
Well technically it wasnt
Why?
They recorded it before Abbey Road
Thats something new to me
Yeah the Abbey Road sessions were the final work they did together
They seemed to always be releasing records.
Almost 2 a year at one point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you think about how much influence the Beatles had on the popular music, it's not hard to understand why they've been so successful.
The Beatles business is still booming after half a century almost.
All because they were so innovative.
Using sampling in popular music was unheard of at the time.
Yep. it was only used by experimental artists at the time.
Yellow submarine...
That brass solo was entirely constructed from the samples.  And what was that other recording technique they used? Track something
Artificial double tracking. It's done during the mixing stage, where another audio is delayed and mixed with the original.
Eleanor Rigby uses that.
As do a few other Beatles songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Are you familiar with the Beatles?
The band?  Yeah I know them.
Do you have a favorite album?
I like Revolver a lot.
That is a good choice.
What about you?
I like Sgt. Peppers.
oh nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you know the music of the Beatles?
Yes of course I love it.
I love it too.
What is your favorite song?
Hmm tough question.
Yeah it is a tough one.
I would say Hey Jude.
That is a great song. I  love the melody.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, it's crazy, my boyfriend said he doesn't like the Beatles.
Wait, are you serious? How can you not like the Beatles?
I know, I asked him the same thing.
What did he say?
I guess he said it's because they played the song Yellow Submarine a lot at one of his jobs and he just got tired of it.
I guess I can see that. That song could get annoying, but what about the other songs?
I'm not sure. I think maybe he just doesn't like them because he thinks they're over-rated.
Well, they are pretty great, but I guess people do kind of worship them.
Yeah that's true. Good thing they're not my favorite band or something.
Yeah, I hope my future boyfriend likes the Beatles!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to cover a few beatles songs

XXXXXXXXXXX
If you arrange the Beatles first names by alphabet what order would it be?
That is not hard to do. It would be G J R and P.
G for George J for John R for Ringo and P for Paul right?
Yeah. Now can you put their the last names in alphabetical order?
I don't know all their last names so no I couldn't.
It would be H L M and .
H for Harrison, L for Lennon, M for McCarthy and S for Starr right?
Yeah. Hey that was pretty good.
I more of a fan of the Beatles music than of their names.
You up for playing some Beatle music trivia?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Beatles album?
The White Album
Cool. I like Abbey Road
That is very innovative
I love how the songs blend into each other.
What is your favorite song?
Oh Darling!
That is a great one
They have so many great hits.
Yeah, they do. I love so many Beatles songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the Beatles' drummer name again?
Ringo.
Ah, that's right. I thought that maybe there was a different drummer before him.
There was - but I can't remember his name!
Ah well - what songs do you like by the Beatles?
"Love Me Do" has a catchy tune and I find myself singing it a lot.
That one is a lot of fun. I like "When I'm Sixty Four".
It's pretty whimsical and fun.
Although it drives my spouse up the wall!
"Hey Jude" does the same for me, especially the end of the song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yeah, I would definitely consider myself a Beatles fan. And by that I mean a fan of their music, not necessarily the guys themselves.
I know... I feel the same.
What is your favorite Beatles album?
Oh wow. Good question. I don't know... The white album maybe, or Sergeant Pepper's.
Good choices. I love those. And Abbey Road. Love it.
Abbey Road. Yes. Actually you're right. I like it even better than Sergeant Pepper's. I Want You was one of my first favorite songs ever.
Oh yes! It's such a trippy, heavy, slightly desperate song. Beautiful.
It's true that there is a bit of discreet desperation, or at least deep, sad, longing in many of the songs of that album.
Yep. Oh Darling comes to mind. Or Because.
Or You Never Give me Your Money. I guess they were starting to feel that fame and success was not all that it cracked up to be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to the Beatles?
They are one of my favorite groups!   I like how their music progresses and changes as they grow older.
Me too!  Their music definitely evolved over the years.  You can tell that the most with the White Album.
Yes!  What is your favorite song on that album?
Helter Skelter.
That's a good one!  You know it's about a slide at a playground, right?
Yeah.  It's got such a unique, hard rock sound to it.
It does!  Then the album has a track the complete opposite like Mother Nature's Son.
I used to listen to that song when I was ready to go to sleep.
It's a good one for it!  Good Night is a good one, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
I really like "Yesterday".
Yeah, that's a great one.
What's your favorite?
"I've Just Seen a Face".
Really? I've never heard of that one.
It's one of their earlier songs. It was featured on the Help! album.
I don't think I've ever listened to that one all the way through.
I think it's also in the movie by the same name.
Cool, I'll definitely check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the original title of abbey road before they changed it?
I think it was Everest?
Yes,in reference to the brand of cigarettes smoked by engineer Geoff emerick.
I'm glad they changed it.
They were going to shoot the cover at Mount Everest but they didn't want to travel that far.
Right,paul suggested they name it after the street they were on.
Hahahahah,and it was a lot easier to walk across the street outside the studio than go to Mount Everest.
Yes,they were a little lazy about that.
I'm glad they were.
Yes,it's a classic album cover indeed
XXXXXXXXXXX
did the beatles have more than 100 albums
i don't think they had that many
they made alot of music
i think they probaly had more than 100 albums i could be wrong

XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you really think Yoko Ono was the reason for the breakup of the Beatles?
No.  I think they had reached the end of the string.
I really enjoy Lovely Rita Meter Maid.
That's a lesser known song for them.  I like All My Loving.
Wh do you think will be the last Beatle?
I think it will be Ringo.  He still looks pretty good.
I believe it will be Paul.  He's ageless.
We'll just have to wait and see.
How many people can you name from the Sgt. Pepper album cover?
Not very many, although there are a lot of them pictured.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Beatles fan?
I am!  Are you?
I certainly am.  One of my favorite bands ever.
how old are you?
33
It's sort of unusual that someone of your age is a fan of them.
Why? It's the basis for so many bands that followed
Do you think so?
Absolutely.  Do you like the early or the late Beatle recordings?
I would say the early stuff. What about you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Across The Universe is a great song
yeah, i guess. i don't really get the message
it's just about taking it easy and letting the universe do it's thing, man
i guess that's a cool message
but more importantly? it's just a pretty song
yeah, the arrangement is really nice
the guitar is soothing!
and john's voice is on point. you have a good point, it's a really good song...i don't know about their best, though
which do you think is their best, then?
i'm so tired. it's just...relatable
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you're probably too young, but do you know anything about the Beetles?
Yeah, my parents used to listen to their songs when I was a kid.
Did you like their songs?
Yeah, I remember liking a few of them a lot.
Like which ones?
"Let it Be" and "Hey Jude" I liked a lot.
I liked those too, but I got sick of hearing them on the radio a lot. So I mostly like the ones that weren't as popular.
Oh really? Like which ones?
When my sisters and I were little, we used to love the song "Anna". I don't think that one ever got any air play on the radio.
The good songs usually don't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the musical adaptations of the Beatles songs in the movie "Across the Universe"?
I really enjoyed them actually.
Yea me too.
I was nice to hear different people sing the songs, like when the girl was singing "I Want to Hold Your Hand".
Yea, they slowed the song down and make it less rockish and more intense.
I also really liked Evan Rachel Wood's adaptation of "Blackbird".
Yea? I wasn't such a fan of that one.
Why not?
I mean it sounded good, but I just don't think it was better than the original.
Yea, I can see that. The original had the guitar and I think in the movie they had some instrument that sounded like an accordion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Beatles music.
I especially like Ringo.
Love love me do.
You know I love you.
Do you think they ever lived in a Yellow Submarine?
Nah but they probably did a lot of acid.
I saw a Cirque du Soleil show that was a Beatles tribuye.
I bet that was fun.
Yesterday had a sad vibe to it.
I believe in yesterday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard a song yesterday that reminded me of "Strawberry Fields Forever." Do you like that song?
Yes, I love that song. Are you a Beatles fan?
Yes, I am. My favorite album is Revolver.
Oh, I'm not really familiar with that album. What songs are on it?
"Taxman," "Eleanor Rigby." The latter is beautiful, one of the first ones to have strings. It's a pretty sad song actually.
Sadder than "Yesterday"?
Yes. "Eleanor Rigby" isn't a love song, it's about loneliness. There are more songs on that album you might know, like "Tomorrow Never Knows"
I have not heard that one, I am mostly familiar with their earlier pop songs from A Hard Days Night and Help.
You should really listen to their middle to late career work. It's cool to hear them experiment. White Album is also good, as is Sgt. Pepper.
Thanks. I will definitely check those out. I really like their ballads, too, so hopefully there are some good ones!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, Shirley, what do you think of the Beatles?
They were great!  Just love their music.
Me too and they are also very handsome!
Yes - especially John and Paul!
I Love You Yeah, Yeah!  One of their best!
They had so many hits.  We loved dancing to their songs.
We did too - did you ever go to the teen club at the church?
I sure did - every Saturday night we danced to the Beatles!
I was there every Saturday too - I loved dancing with Tim to their songs.
I still enjoy listening to their music - "Hey Jude" was another favorites of mine.  Awesome song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the most popular Beatles song?
I think most people like Hey Jude
I wonder if it might be Revolution
I don't think so.
That is one of their best though
I agree
Twist and Shout is pretty popular
Yes. That might be better well known than Hey Jude
Is Hey Jude one of your favorites?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Helter Skelter?
Yes
Do you know which album it is on?
The White Album
Yes. How did you know?
I own The White Album
That is their best album
That is a solid point. Every album is amazing.
Do you like the Let it Be album?
That is awesome. I love Let it Be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you have any beatles clothing
i think i got a shirt
where did you get it
at the mall it was on sale
how much was it
i paid like twenty dollars and some change
cool thats a good price they got more beatles apparel
yeah i saw some cool jeans
how much where they, and did they have all the beatles on them
yeah they where very cool they had the beatles on the legs
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever really listened to a compared songs from the Beatles first few years until there last?
Not really, why?
Well they change so much from their first songs that were fairly innocent and light.
I mean, I guess that is true. I Want To Hold Your Hand is very different from Let It Be.
Oh they are worlds apart.
They definitely get deeper as they go.
And sometimes a little weirder. Like I Am The Walrus.
Well yeah, maybe that speaks to some of their substance abuse issues.
Maybe, but no matter what they are still one of the best bands of all time in my books.
I think anyone who really knows music would agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you know about the BEatles
Uh... They made their debut on Ed Sullivan and the girls went wild over them. They were part of the British Invasion, two of them are dead. How much do you need to know?
Just having a conversation.
Uh. Paul and John wrote a lot of the songs together.
Do you like any of the Beatle's songs.
Yeah. I like the Birthday Song and I wanna hold your hand.
Who's your favorite Beatle?
Paul McCartney Probably. Lennon seemed arrogant at time. That's why he can't be my favorite. But he was a brilliant songwriter.
How many of the Beatles can you name?
Paul McCartney, John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison. Did you think I could do it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey lets talk about the beatles music
That sounds great
Do you like them?
I love them
I dont know too many of their songs
You need to listen to penny lane
Is it good?
Its the best
Ill look it up then
Great
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm putting together a Beatles playlist to listen to with my kids. Do have any suggestions of Beatles songs that are good for kids?
Definitely Octopus's Garden. And Yellow Submarine.
Yup, I 've got them, and Twist and Shout. What else?
Haha my Aunt used to sing "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" to me every time we crossed the street.
Aw, that's sweet, Okay, I guess I have to add that one.
Oh, and wasn't "Hey Jude" written for one of their kids? Add that one.
Okay. Any others?
"Julia" is a nice, mellow one. It reminds me of going to the beach.
Huh, I don't know that one.
It was on the White Album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatle song?
I could be like most people and say Hey Jude or I wanna hold your hand, but I prefer some of their deeper stuff like A day in the Life or side 2 of Abbey Road (Golden Slumbers, et al).
The later songs are pretty good, but sometimes get too serious for me. I prefer the earlier hits.
I can understand, but I think the true value of the Beatles as "THE" Super Band is their later music.
Probably is, but I just like their "boy band" songs better, you know, I Saw her standing there and Eight Days a week.
I get you, but for me songs like Tomorrow Never Knows and She's Leaving Home are more inspiring.
You may be right. If I had to pick some of their later songs it would be ones like Penny Lane or Yellow Submarine.
Those are fun and I think help move listeners over into their more serious stuff. Don't get me wrong, I think the great thing about the Beatles is that they are both fun and deep!
I agree, that's why that are the super group of all time!
What's the saying, if you don't like the Beatles you don't like music! LOL!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Beatles movies?
Nope, like Yellow Submarine, right?
Yes, Yellow Submarine is one, but it's not their most influential.
What is?
A Hard Day's Night from 1964.
What made it so influential?
Have you heard of The Monkees?
Yeah, they were a British pop band with a TV show, right?
Yes, A Hard Day's Night was the inspiration behind that show. A Hard Day's Night is also credited with inspiring many spy films too!
Wow, that's incredible. I need to watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Thinking about it, I'm a really big fan of how vulnerable The Beatles were.
Oh, I know. They wore their vulnerabilities and insecurities on their sleeves.
Think of a song like "You've Got to Hide Your Love Away."
Exactly, it's about fear of heartbreak and of showing your love.
Or "I'm a Loser"
Ha ha ha! That's a pretty self-deprecating title.
Yes, it is. I think another great, although less heart-on-the-sleeve is "Let It Be."
Why do you say that?
Well, the song is about the stresses and troubles and darkness of light and deciding to just let it be.
That's true, I've actually never realized what that song is really about even though I've heard it hundreds of times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have been hearing them all over the radio lately
Who
The beatles
Well they are still popular
Yeah it is just kinda grating
Why is it grating
Because they are so overplayed
Nah they can never be overplayed
Well i beg to differ
Well i differ your differ
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the beatles
Great topic
They are a good band
The best
I have an old record of theirs
Thats so cool
I dont have a record player though so i cant listen to it
That sucks
I know
You should find them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like the Beatles?
I have not really thought about it- I guess I do.
What's your favorite song?
I think Yesterday and Blackbird are a tie
I love Blackbird!
I think you would like the greatest hits album
Hmm I never thought of that. Do you like it?
Yes, it spans the whole catalog
Does it have Come Togather?
Yes it does!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your favorite Beatles' song.
Oh that's a tough question. Probably Yellow Submarine.
Oh right, that's a classic.
What's yours?
I love A Hard Day's Night.
Yeah, that's got some really great lyrics.
Did you ever see that movie with their music. I forget what it's called.
Oh, do you mean Across the Universe?
Oh, that's the one! I loved that movie.
Me too. I used to listen to the soundtrack all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yes,I love them.
I grew up listening to them.
I'm a little younger but I love their music.
What's your favorite song?
Hey Jude!
Actually that's one of mine too,love it!
It was unique because it went so long.
It was a classic for sure.
Yes it was,absolutely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know why living in Liverpool, England was a big benefit for the Beatles.
Not really. I know it's a midsized city, but that it wasn't super cosmopolitan like London.
Exactly. On paper it seems improbable that it would have birthed a band as dynamic as The Beatles.
Yeah, why do you bring this up? Do you have a theory?
A well supported theory, actually?
Well, what is it? Why was Liverpool beneficial to The Beatles.
Liverpool was a port city and it received a lot of American blues, rockabilly, and soul records.
That makes total sense. I knew that The Beatles music was impossible without that stuff.
Yup. Their early stuff includes a lot of covers of American music.
I just had a thought, with the internet, every city is a port city in the sense of having access to culture.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss when music was as good as it was when the Beatles were making music.
You like the Beatles too? I love their music.
Yeah, I mean songs like Come Together and All You need is Love just don't happen anymore.
I agree. Those were timeless songs.
They were really were. All of their music was just so powerful.
True. It really spoke to the people about world issues and brought people together.
And it still does. Their music is still relevant.
Absolutely. We can still watch Paul McCartney sing a few songs every now and then.
Yea, true but its not the same. I just loved music that the Beatles made together.
Same. It never gets old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Beatle?
It has to be George Harrison. And you?
Paul McCartney. What's your favorite song?
That's a hard one, but I'm going to go with Taxman, because George sang lead on it.
My favorite is the classic, Hey Jude.
I love that one as well. I know somebody who named their kid after the song.
I bet a lot of people have done that.
Did you ever see their rooftop performance? Killer!
Totally! They were one of a kind.
We'll never see or hear anyone like them, that's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the rumor about Paul  McCartney being dead?
There was a rumor in the 1960s that Paul got killed in a car accident, and it was covered up so the wotld wouldn't panic.
Yes, I heard there wa a coverup that his female fans would have killed themselves if true.
Yes,the rumor was he was replaced with a lookalike called Faul.
Did this rumor get debunked?
Yes,the real Paul went on David Letterman and said he is quite alive.
Do you have any idea why there were rumors?
Most likely to sell more Beatles records.
I am glad this is settled as I love Paul.
I do as well. He is my favorite Beatle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to know: who do you like better, the Rolling Stones or the Beatles?
Definitely the Beatles.
Why?
Even though their career was relatively short, the Beatles showed such great range and experimented with so many different styles. I think their lyrics were so meaningful.
What are your favorite Beatles lyrics?
Probably "Yesterday". Though, there are lots of great ones.
Like "In My Life"? That one is so nostalgic.
Yes! I love that song, too.
I almost don't want to get started listing great Beatles songs. There are so many.
I know. What a great group.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of The Beatles movies?
I saw 'A Hard Day's Night' years ago and enjoyed it.
That's a great movie, they look so young!
I love their sense of humor in it. The script is great.
Is that the only one you've seen?
Yes, what others are there?
There's 'Help!' and 'Magical Mystery Tour'.
Oh 'Help!', of course. I've seen clips of it.
And 'Magical Mystery Tour'?
I haven't seen it but I've heard it's really weird, just like the album of the same name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the Beatles?
Yes! The Beatles are my favorite band of all time.
Cool, me too!
Who do you think was a better songwriter between John Lennon and Paul McCartney?
I'm not sure really. I think they worked best as a team honestly.
That's a good point.
I also think George Harrison is an extremely underrated songwriter.
I didn't realize he wrote too. What songs did he write?
Here Comes the Sun, Something, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are three examples that come to mind.
Oh wow. He really was talented too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big fan of the Beatles?
Yes and no. I like some stuff.
What is your favorite song?
My favorite sounds silly but is Yellow Submarine.
That is a unique choice.
I just like that it's different and make me happy at at the same time.
Did you know they were only together for less than 10 years.
They sure do have a lot of songs packed into those years.
Do you like any of their solo careers?
I definitely like a lot of Paul McCartney's solo stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your favorite Beatles song?
Probably "I wanna hold your hand". Why you ask?
I dunno just because. I really don't see why they are so popular.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Maybe must because they we're like the first rock band.
That could be true.
You know what, I really don't hear anyone talk much about the Beatles anymore.
I rarely see them on t.v nowadays.
It would be so cool if they made a comeback.
Yeah, they should come out and make some new songs.
That would be awesome. We all need some new good, songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A lot of people think Ringo Star was a bad drummer
Over time, that has been proven to be wrong.
How do you know that?
First of all,  before Ringo, drummers were measured by the drumming solo.  Ringo didn't do that.
He always was just in the background
Not really.  What Ringo did was drum as an integral part of the song.  Like in the song, from the album Help, people said that they knew what song was going to be played just by a few measures of his drums.
So he changed the role of the drummer by becoming one with the band
Except in the cases of the huge stadium concerts.  The screaming was so loud he could hear what the rest of the guys were singing
So what did he do?
He kept the beat going by watching how the other guys were wiggling their butts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hi.
Do you have a favorite Beatles song of all time?
I liked that remake they did in the 90's.
Free as a Bird?
Yeah that's the one.
Well, it wasn't really a remake?
What do you mean?
It was an unfinished track and they found some of John's vocals for the track.
Oh interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your all-time favorite band?
It would have to be the Beatles.
Oh, I love them, too! What's your favorite album?
Rubber Soul. Such great songs - especially "Day Tripper" and "We Can Work It Out".
That's just when they were starting to transcend their teenybopper pop roots. I prefer their later, more psychedelic stuff like Sgt. Pepper's.
I enjoy that, too, but some of that stuff is too far out there for me. I like the songs where Lennon and McCartney seem to work together well.
Everyone always talks about Lennon and McCartney, but George was great, too.
Yeah, he had a really strong solo career. Not as strong as John's, but stronger than Paul's, in my opinion.
Did you know there was a "Fifth Beatle", their producer, George Martin.
I think I read that once. He was a master, too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to the Beatles?
Sometimes I do.
My mom found an old box of records in the basement. There were a few Beatles albums in there.
Do you have a record player?
My mom found one in the basement. It still works.
What albums did you find?
We found Revolver, A Hard Day's Night and Let It Be.
I heard that there's a Beatles album that's worth thousands of dollars.
It's called Yesterday and Today. It wasn't in the box.
I wonder why it's worth so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you said you were into rock, but does that include the Beatles?
Yeah, definitely. I don't know all the ins and outs of the band, but I love the Beatles.
Oh okay, cool. I like them a lot too.
Yeah, they're such a talented band. They were like an all star band.
I vaguely remember one of my friends saying that Mick Jagger once said something to the effect of "We have one lead singer, they have four," when referring to the Beatles.
Wow, that's impressive! They're all geniuses, but some of their songs are kind of out there.
For sure, the Beatles went through a huge artistic and style change over there short time as a band. Initially they were all in suits playing pop songs and they became a pretty trippy band wearing lots of flamboyant and colorful outfits.
Yeah, like the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. They had awesome outfits in that vinyl art and they looked really stoned, haha.
Haha, yeah. Oh, another interesting tidbit is I think Yesterday is the most covered song of all time, but I could be wrong about that though.
I love that song. I wouldn't be surprised.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard ringo is coming out with another album?
I read that somewhere.
I think the end of this year or early next.
I love ringo and I really like his solo stuff.
He's had a lot of hits. He's touring again with an all star band too.
Wow,I saw him a few years ago. Great show!!
I did too. Joe Walsh was part of the group.
He's great on his own too.
Yes,and he's ringo brother in law.
That's right. He got married after the Beatles broke up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been on a Beatles kick lately.
They are iconic!
I've been listening to them all day.
What do you think about John and Yoko Ono?
I actually liked them together!
Wow. Really?
I know everyone hated them together but I thought they were really in love and it was inspiring.
I think she broke the Beatles up! Anyways, what song are you listening to?
I'm listening to I Wanna Hold Your Hand!
I love that one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Yellow Submarine?
No. I don't like cartoony trippy movie.
The music is great.
I bet it is. But then I can listen to it on my own.
Yellow submarine is my favorite Beattle's song!
There are so many good ones! It is hard to pick a favorite.
What is your least favorite?
I don't like the stuff from the White Album.
I do! But I don't Sergant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band.
It does go on a long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are The Beatles still alive?
Paul and Ringo are.
What about the others?
John Lennon was shot and George has passed away too.
That's too bad. I love their music.
Me too. They have tons of classics.
Where are they from?
Liverpool
Did any of them go solo?
They all had solo careers too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Beatle?
I loved them all but my favorite was John Lennon.
Me too. He was such a great songwriter and singer.
My favorite songs he wrote were A Hard Day´s Night and Ticket to Ride.
Great songs! My favorites were Help! and Nowhere Man.
Some of the best were a collaboration between John and Paul.
George Harrison also wrote some great ones too.
Yeah I think While My Guitar Gently Weeps was absolutely beautiful.
That was one of the Beatles best.
Definitely one of the best in all of rock music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you know Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings?
Um...yeah...the Beatles. One of the most classic bands of all times.
I like some of their stuff, like Help and Love Me Do. Very catchy.
Dig deeper. Eleanor Rigby is a good one, so is Norwegian Wood. Some of their lesser known songs, in my opinion, are better.
What is your favorite song of theirs?
Let It Be, or Norwegian Wood. So many to choose from!
Where should I start getting into the music?
Abbey Road is good. The White Album, maybe, or a greatest hits album.
Thanks. I'll check it out.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You listen to the Beatles, right?
They're one of my favorite bands.
Who is your favorite band member?
George Harrison, he wrote Here Comes the Sun. It's my all time favorite song.
His guitar playing was great. I loved it in, A Hard Day's Night.
Which band member do you like best?
John Lennon, I think he is good musician and I love his artwork. Do you have an album you like best?
Please Please Me, is probably my favorite. I love all the song on it especially, Twist and Shout.
The Sgt. Pepper album is my favorite.
That's a great one too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to the old Beatles songs recently.
Who listens to them anymore?
They influenced the development of rock and roll.
What songs did that?
Their first break through hit was Love Me Do.
I remember that one.
It was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney
Who sang it?
Usually the Beatle that did the most composing on the song, sang the lead.  So John Lennon sang this one
I always liked his voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
It's so tough to pick just one - do you have one?
Probably 'Dear Prudence', but you're right, it's tough.
I have different favorites for different moods. Right now it's 'Helter Skelter'.
Paul McCartney's vocals are killer on that!
It's like really early heavy metal, I love it.
There was a couple of heavy tracks on 'The White Album'.
Yeah, and then such mellow and calm ones too.
Such a versatile band, it's amazing.
I'm not sure there's ever been a band as versatile as The Beatles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just listened to the song Yesterday by the Beatles.
That is a great song.
I love their music because every song is so different.
I agree I really like Back in the USSR.
It's amazing what a sensation they were.
Definitely they were so popular.
I can't think of another band who had such a following.
I wish I had been able to see them live one time.
Me too, but for now I'm going to download some more of their music.
I have a book about the Beatles, now I'm going to take a look at it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Yes, I do!
What is your favorite Beatles song?
Help!
I need somebody help!
Not just anybody help!
I love that song too!
What is your favorite Beatles song?
I enjoy Hey Jude.
Yeah that is really a classic Beatles song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you know about the Beatles and their spouses?
I can hold my own when it comes to the Beatles.
Okay. What Beatle had a wife named Yoko Ono?
Piece of cake that would be John Lennon.
For five hundred points if you can tell me if John and Ono had children A. Was that child male or female and B. What is the child’s name.
That piece of Beatles trivia is worth more than 500 points. However, John and Yoko’s child is a male and his name is Julian.
True or False? Paul McCarthey wrote songs for the Beatles with his wife?
That's true.
Is it true that both John Lennon and Paul McCarthey of Beatles wives are still living?
No that’s not true. John’s wife Yoko is the only one of the two still living.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's that song you're listening to?
It's, "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da".
The name doesn't sound familiar. Who's the artist?
The Beatles. I'd consider it one of their lesser known songs.
I thought I knew the band, but I didn't recognize the song. What album is it on?
It's on their white album.
That explains it. It's been a while since I've listened to it.
It's the one I listen to the most.
What songs are your favorites?
"Helter Skelter", Revolution", "Rocky Raccoon", and "Dear Prudence". The other songs are great too, but those are the ones I like the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have my granddaughter loving the Beatles music.
Oh that's great to hear.
Yes,it means a lot to me.
That's really cool. My younger son likes them too.
We sing along to them a lot
We do too.
In fact my granddaughter has seen paul McCartney live twice with me.
Are you kidding me.
Nope. It was fantastic. A dream come true for me.
I'm sure she'll always remember!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think paul McCartney and ringo Starr will ever tour together?
I don't know but I hope so
That would be cool
It would but I know paul has said in the past that it would be tough
It would because they both stay really busy
They do stay busy.
I believe they both are working on new albums.
I heard that too.
I heard paul,already recorded something on ringos upcoming album
I saw that in Rolling Stone
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long have you been a beatles fan?
Several of years?
Are any of your family or friends into the beatles?
One or two of them, i stand out from the crowd?
How many album covers do you curently own?
1 of them is a record and two are cd's. I use mp3 a lot so cd's are in the past.
Who is your favorite band member?
John Lennon
What brought you to liking this music?
When i prounce around, i like to listen to past time classic oldies. Why not the beatles?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Paul McCartney turned 75 a few days ago. Can you believe that?
Wow. He still seems pretty healthy and active for his age.
Yes, and he's still a very talented performer.
Is he the last surviving Beatle?
No, Ringo Starr is also still alive.
That's right, I almost forgot about him.
I wish that John Lennon and George Harrison were also still alive.
How long ago did each of them die?
George Harrison died of cancer in 2001 and John Lennon was killed in 1980.
Wow. What terrible losses.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Beatles album?
I like them all. How can you have a favorite?
Each album is a different period of artistic expression. Sargent Peppers is different than Let it Be or the White Album.
Those are good. I guess I always liked Abbey Road. I like the cover.
"Come Together," "Octopus' Garden," "Here Comes the Sun" -- all excellent!
John Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, what's your favorite song by Paul McCartney on Abbey Road?
That's easy. "Maxwell's Silver Hammer," totally.
There was a lot of activity in the band at that time.
Yeah, John Lennon had already left the band and Paul McCartney followed about a year later.
Well, to get back to your question, I guess that Abbey Road is my favorite Beatles album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i did'nt know the beatles made penny lane
i know they had it on one of there albums

What's your favorite Beatle's song?
Oh come on, seriously? Who could ever choose just one?
Haha. Good point.
Yeah, i mean, they were geniuses, including George Martin
Yes, definitely the fifth Beatle.
Absolutely
I think Yesterday is one of my favorite.
Sure. How can you not like that one.
I know. DId you know Paul wrote it after hearing it in a dream?
Really? No, i had no idea!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love that one song that was covered the beatles originally did
What song
In my life
That is a good song
I love the cover and the original
Who covered it
Ozzy Osbourne did
oh yeah i have heard that one
It works because it sounds rockish modernly but the same as the old one too
Yeah but noone can be better than they were
XXXXXXXXXXX
I you could choose a single Beatles album as your favorite, which one would that be?
Oh, there are quite a few albums that I like, but I'd have to say "Rubber Soul" is probably my favorite.
Can you tell me why that is? What in particular draws you to that album?
Well, I think it's the songs. "You're Gonna Lose That Girl" really draws me in, and it always has.
What is it about that song that you like?
It's the harmonies. When I was a kid I used to listen to it over and over again, to learn to sing harmony. It's so rewarding now to sing with the album!
Whose harmonies are you singing?
I think it's Paul - my voice and his have always been quite similar, so I can usually sing his parts. Though my voice isn't as good as it used to be!
Is Paul your favorite Beatle?
I always thought he was the most good looking of the bunch - but I have to say John and George were always next in line!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into the Beatles?
I can see their impact for sure.
I just dont find alot of their stuff that good.
You might be the only one to say that.
It definitely spans decades.
Yeah I will say that its still relevant today.
Many of their hits still get radio air time.
I find that I can tolerate them for a little bit.
But you never just listened to an album straight through?
No because the music stylings vary so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you know who the Beatles are?
Sure.
Do you have any favorite songs?
I really like the Long and Winding Road.
That is a nice song.
Also Golden Slumber.
Don't know if I know that one.
It's quite good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you know about the Beatles?
My parents really liked them a lot.
Not you?
I know a little bit about them.
Do you have any favorite songs?
I like Helter Skelter.
That is a really good track.
Yeah it is good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the beatles went through a very spiritual phase?
I had heard something like that.. which songs were during that time?
Well I would argue for Instant Karma, but not sure.
Well Karma is certainly a spiritual message.
The other lyrics in about all shinning on speaks to reincarnation to me.
I never thought to much about it. But you are right it does convey that idea.
Swami Prabhupada had had a large influence on them especially george I think.
I think he had converted to hinduism even.
I believe that is correct. George was an interesting man.
I think each was so interesting in their own way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the early Beatles work?
Yes, it is good, but their later stuff is better.
Happiness is a Warm Gun is a great song. Do you like it?
Yes, it's one of my favorites.
Do you like the Ringo songs a lot?
Yes, they are all unique
I love his deep voice.
Me too. With A Little Help from My Friends is so memorable.
Is he your favorite band member?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Lady Madonna the best song on Hey Jude?
No I dont think so by a long shot.
So what do you prefer?
The song Hey Jude for starters.
OK outside of what that track is, what do you expect from it?
Dont let me down is my personal favorite.
How did you feel about the album as an overall sound?
You can tell they didnt record together.
The mixing was great.
I mean the producer worked wonders. But you can tell this was disheveled.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Beatle has the best voice?
They are all great, but I like Paul the best.
He has a really good voice.
They all have a unique style.
What do you think of Lennon?
He has a really great voice and can sing amazingly.
Who sang the most songs?
John and Paul sang the most.
Who sings Hey Jude?
Paul McCartney.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good Beatles song?
Girl
Who sings it?
John Lennon
Didn't he go solo after the band broke up?
Yeah and he has some albums too that are solo.
What is one of his solo songs?
Jealous Guy
I am a huge John Lennon fan.
He is one of the best musicians ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, my husband doesn't like the Beatles!
What? How is that possible?
I don't know, I think he says it just to get me going.  He knows I love the Beatles, especially John.
I prefer Paul, but together they wrote some amazing songs.
I agree, I enjoy tribute bands, but I really wish that they were all still alive so they could do a reunion tour.
That would be AMAZING!!  If they would even do that, they stopped touring early in their career.
Oh, that's right.  I remember hearing that.
What is your favorite Beatles song?
That is a tough question, I love the well known ones, but Rocky Racoon always make me smile!
Oh yes, that one is good.  I think Something is my favorite, but then I will hear Eleanor Rigby, and that could be my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey,the song day in the life from the Beatles wasn't played in England until like 1985!
Really? Why is that.
The line,"I'd love to turn you on" was considered a reference to drugs and that didn't go over to well in England.
Can you imagine? The crap that's allowed on radio now is rediculous compared to that.
I know. Stuffed shirts in England.
Boy isn't that the truth.
In fact,the song took awhile in America to be accepted because it was different and so long.
Yes,I've read that too.
Hard to believe because it's an iconic song now.
It sure is and always will be
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beatles song?
Who are the Beatles?
They were the biggest band to come out of England in the 60s their music defined the era.
Really what are some of their songs?
Long and winding road, she loves me so many songs I can't list.
Doesn't sound familiar.
Oh, you love John Lennon. You love the cover guns and roses did of Live and let die, that was one of their songs.
Was he in that band? Yes, now I  know who you mean.
Yes, him Paul Mccartney, Ringo Starr and someone else I can't recall their name.
I guess I do know some of their music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into the Beatles at all?
I like the Let It Be album.
Oh I listened to that yesterday.
What songs?
Two of Us.
One of my favorites.
I also like Dig a Pony.
I don't care for that one much personally.
Well you are missing out!
I guess so!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Beatles voice do you like best?
I like Paul McCartney's the best.
Why him?
I think his voice was versatile and he sang good ballads.
What's your favorite ballad?
I really liked his singing on Yesterday.
I prefer John Lennon's voice.
Do you have a favorite song that he sang?
I love the song A Hard Day;s Night.
That's a great classic rock song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what Beatles's songs and from what albums do you love?
I love "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" from Abbey Road!
Why do you love it so much? It is not one of the usual ones!
Well, it is because how unique it is!
What do you mean? Please do explain!
Well the song has a strong acoustic.  How about you? Which songs of Beatles do you like?
I am more mainstream. I love "Here Comes the Sun" and "Yesterday"
How about "Don't Let Me Down?"
Oh yeah, I love that number it is so easy to listen to!
I agree, I can "chill" while listening to it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who they say the fifth Beatle is?
Pete Best, the original drummer?
Nope, wanna take another guess?
Yoko? John's wife?
Nope, but a good guess.
Well, who is it then?
George Martin.
Who's he?
George Martin produced many of their greatest albums. And it wasn't just that he produced, he did some arrangements too.
Wow, I'm gonna have to read more about George Martin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
I used to growing up because my parents love them. Do you?
Yeah. Sometimes. Right now I'm listening to Come Together.
That song is awesome!
What did your parents listen to mostly?
They liked the songs In My Life and Yesterday.
I think I've heard of those.
Yesterday is my favorite.
Do you still listen to them now?
Sometimes I listen to the Help! album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the Beatles had a different name?
The music group?
Yeah, do you know what their name was?
No, what was it?
It was The Beetles!
Well, that's not really different.
I guess not, but most people don't know about it.
I guess not, but some people probably don't know the difference in spelling.
I guess you're right.
I wonder if there were any names before that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you feel The Beatles are overrated?
Absolutely not, they are essential in my mind.
I just don't see it, I mean they are catchy enough, but many consider them the best band ever.
I'm one of those people, there's never been a better final album than Let it Be and it wasn't even one of their stronger overall.
What tracks would you recommend, perhaps I should give them another chance.
Listen to a day in the life, strawberry fields forever and come together, see what you think.
I'll check them out, still don't think I'll like them better than The Stones.
Stones as in Rolling Stones? C'mon now great band in their own right, but they can't hold a candle to The Beatles.
We can agree to disagee, although who knows maybe I'll notice something with The Beatles this time.
You wouldn't be the first, sometimes it takes more than one listen. By the way Yesterday, listen to that one as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie A Hard Day's Night?
No.
It's so funny.
They seem funny.
They are as funny as any pro comedians.
What's it about?
Them, preparing for a television show.
That's it?
That's all you need.
That, and love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like that song I am the Walrus by the Beatles.
Yeah it is a great song.
It has some weird lyrics.
I agree, they really don't make any sense.
I've heard it was a commentary for people looking into their songs to much for hidden meanings.
I just like the song, I don't analyze the lyrics.
Same here but that song has a few weird lines.
Yeah it does, maybe that is why I like it.
Yeah me to, I am the Walrus.
I am the egg man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Paul McCartney is the best Beatle?
That is impossible to tell.
Why?
Because it is entirely subjective. For example, I like Ringo the best.
Really? What song do you like the most of his?
Yellow Submarine.
Col. I thought everyone liked Paul.
A lot of people do. But, that does not mean he is the best.
True.
John Lennon is also pretty amazing and so is George.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Beattle's album?
Rubber Sole.
I have never heard of that album.  When did it come out?
I think 1965.
Why is it your favorite album?
It reminds me of my childhood, my dad played it all the time.
That's really sweet.  Any song stand out the most?
In my life. It was my dads favorite so we would sing it together.
That's a very poignent song.
That whole album is, No where man is also a deep song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that The Beatles biggest musical rival was Elvis Presley?
No I did not know that.
Yes , Elvis had 21 number one hits but the Beatles only had 17.
They are both great in their own right!
They sure are. The first Beatles song to hit number one was Love Me Do.
Oh yes. I believe that was written by Lennon and McCartney.
You are right about that.
What was the second hit?
It was She Loves You.
That was a great song too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was listening to the radio this morning and they were playing a Beatles song.
What was it?
Yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine...that is a happy song.
Yeah, it took me back to my childhood.
I remember my father calling them hippies.
Mine too, he would not let us watch them when they were on "The Ed Sullivan Show".
Oh, he must have been strict.
Yes, he thought their music was going to ruin America.
All parents think their children's music is radical.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the weirdest song the Beatles ever recorded?
Revolution 9.
Why is it so weird?
Because the track keeps saying number 9 over and over.
That's it?
Also, supposedly if you play it backwards it says, :Turn me on dead man."
OK. That's weird.
It was all part of a rumor that Paul was dead.
So why do the song?
Because it was a clue about Paul being dead.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was younger, I went through a phase when the only band I listened to was the Beatles.
Really? When I was little I used to listen to them with my mom.
Was she a Beatles fan?
Yes, but she was too young for true Beatlemania. She told me she cried the day they broke up.
Ha ha, my father used to claim that that was John Lennon's wife's fault. But I heard recently that she had nothing to do with it.
Yoko Ono. Didn't she recently get credit for helping to write "Imagine?"
I heard that too. That is such an awesome song.
My favorite Beatles song is "Blackbird." What is yours?
I like "Oh Blah Di."
That's a good one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old were you when you first heard The Beatles?
I was in college
Did you ever see them live?
No. I was not alive in the 60's.
I see. What was the first song you heard?
"Girl"
That is a good one.
How about you?
I first heard them when I was 16.
Awesome. Most people discover them in high school.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you fan of the Beatles?
Well, I don't hate them
They were all the rage back in the 60's
I wonder how they would fare now
I don't know
I bet if they modernized with the times, they would still be super stars
I wonder if their fates would have ended the same if they were performers now
Probably, history has a way of repeating itself
At least we have them memorialized for all time
I'll have to look up their music and see for myself
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me something about the Beatles that you thought was questionable, or very different about their music.
I always thought that their travelling to India was pretty weird.
Why did you think that?
Well, I used to wonder why George Harrison got into Indian music. I mean, did he just meet up with Ravi Shankar and jam with him, and decide to become an Indian swami himself?
Do you think that was wrong?
I thought they were all way to drugged out and just wanted to go to India to get their hands on some far-out opium or something like that.
Did you believe that they were using drugs? Drugs like opium, or heroin?
I think that they were tripping a lot, dropping tons of acid, and that they wanted a different sort of head. And they couldn't do that legally in England or America, so they traveled to where they could get it easily.
Does that make them bad in your eyes?
I was too young to really understand drug use. I only knew it was bad, and I thought they they were being led astray by foreigners from far-off lands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any good songs lately?
Yes from the Beatles.
Oh me too!
What album?
Let It Be.
I love Dig It on that album.
I do too but I love Maggie Mae more.
I am not that into that song.
What is your other favorite?
One After 909
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Let it be… Naked?
Yeah, I'm so glad they put out that album.
I think it's way better than the original Let it Be.
I was thrilled that they included Don't Let Me Down.
Yes! That's one of my favorite Beatles songs ever.
The single version never had the same feel as the version they recorded on the Apple Corps rooftop.
The new version sounds so much better. The album is worth purchasing for that song alone.
I agree. I also really like the new version of Across the Universe.
Yeah, but there are so many different versions of that song.
I think the Let it Be… Naked version is my favorite of them all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, is that a beatles song?
Yes it is the Beatles song "I want to hold you hand".
I love that song! I also like Strawberry Fields.
That one is alright if you like a slow song. I like a faster one.
Yea I do like their faster songs like Help.
It is a great song that you want to Jam to.
Yes I also like the Beatles  later songs like I want you.
Oh that is a great one! "She's so heavy.."
I have to say that their later songs were not as good.
I know it is like the Beatles were doing something to make them crazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who's your favorite Beatle?
Wow, that's hard to choose. All four of them were extremely talented.
I know! There's Paul who was a great songwriter -- I mean, who can top songs like Hey Jude and Yesterday?
Well, John was an amazing songwriter too! He wrote In My life and Strawberry Fields Forever!
I know, it's so hard to pick. Speaking of songwriting -- don't forget George Harrison. He wrote Here Comes the Sun, one of my faves!
I didn't know George wrote that one? That's an awesome song.
Yeah, George Harrison wrote many songs but Paul and John usually didn't put many songs of his on the albums.
I didn't know that? What other songs did George write?
I believe he wrote, Good Day Sunshine too!
That's another great Beatles song. Wow, it's hard to pick my favorite -- I love them all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite Beatle?
I'd say Paul is.
Yeah, I think I'm with you there.  John made some good songs but Paul is a genius.
Yeah, Sgt. Pepper was pretty much all his idea.  John knew the vibe of what Paul was going for and made some good ones too though.
Yeah that's true.  Really though, George Martin played a huge part in all that as well.
Yeah, his work in the studio was unbelievable.
I don't think the Beatles could have made it to where they got without Martin.  That guy knew some serious tricks.
Yeah it was crazy.  I'm sure what Brian Wilson did with Pet Sounds gave them a lot of ideas as well.  I think that's why Paul wanted to do Sgt. Pepper in the first place.
Yeah I do believe that's right.  Pet Sounds in phenomenal as well but I think Sgt. Pepper is still better.
The Beatles really did everything better.  They were just musical geniuses.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the first Beatle song you remember hearing?
I want to hold your hand
What was it about that song that made you like the Beatles?
The lyrics were outstanding and the singing was spectacular.
What is your favorite all-time Beatle recording?
Probably Hey Jude.
What is your next favorite?
Probably Yesterday.
What do you consider the most unusual song they recorded?
A Day In
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, so, I saw a friend of mine once at the local park.  Him and his band were performing various songs including some tunes by the Beatles.
Oh, that's cool, what ones did they do?
You know,  I can't recall off-hand, but it was kind of weird..
What do you mean?
They're were playing this one song where the guy is mentioning suicide and stuff and I'm like, "Whoa... is this the same band that song 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand' and 'Let It Be' and all those?
Well, they've gone their share of sad songs before.  Like "Yesterday" and "Long and Winding Road".
Yeah, plus I asked my friend about that after the show and he explained that the particular was from the White album.  And I'm like, "Oh, that makes sense."
How so?
Well, I've been told that's kind of an odd album in Beatles discography. Among other things, it's the one Charles Manson was claiming he was hearing "secret messages" from.
Meh... I'm not sure Manson is someone we should turn to for any sort of reliable info.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you hearing?
The Beatles!!! Do you like them too?
Oh wow, I heard a lot of them but never heard that song.
It's called We can work it out! I think it came out in 1970,
Sounds a little different from the others, why is that?
Oh probably because that's from the time Lennon and McCartney worked together, they composed the best lyrics but then Lennon left and things changed.
They were great after that too but I have to admit they were better when they had Lennon.
They also wrote for other singers, Fame sung by David Bowie was written by Lennon and McCartney too!
Sad times for the company that turned them down before they got famous!!! What a money machine!
Yeah Decca's bad move there, Parlophone had the best move and signed them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't stand music today. I feel like true artists are gone.
No one is as great as The Beatles.
Oh my, so true. They are classic.
You know what one of my favorite songs is that most people don't know?
What is that?
Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band is a so great.
You know, that is not what pops in my mind as a Beatles song right away, but it is a classic.
It is a shame that more people don't listen to them these days.
I think a fair amount of people still do.
I know I will never stop being a Beatles fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're a big Beatles fan, aren't you?
I LOVE The Beatles! I have all of their music.
I just got the White Album and I'm listening to it right now. It's good.
It's REALLY good. I really like Happiness is a Warm Gun and I Will.
I like While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Who is singing on that?
That one is George Harrison. It's one of the best songs of his.
I also like Why Don't We Do It In the Road? Funny!
Yes, that's a good one. If you're going to buy Beatles music you need to check out Rubber Soul.
Okay, what's good on that one? I'll be sure to look into it.
The whole album is good. My favorite is the song Girl. Beautiful!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I saw an old rerun of the Dick Caat show on YouTube.
Yeah? Who was he interviewing?
George Harrison of the Beatles.
Nice. What was he like?
Not like anything I imagined.
What did you imagine?
I don't know. Some pompous, arrogant pop star who was self-centered and ignorant.
And what was he like?
He was a nice guy. A bit shy and quirky, but he didn't seem like a jerk.
A rare animal in the music industry! For sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles much?
I guess so, I mean they're pretty old aren't they? I do like Hey Jude, though.
It's funny that I'm not that old, but they're such a part of my childhood anyway. I mean I wasn't even alive in the sixties.
When was the first time you heard them?
Actually, we sung Octopus's Garden when I was in third grade for an elementary school performance.
Cute!
Yeah, and when I was in high school I played Eleanor Rigby for the orchestra.
Does it translate well into classical music?
You wouldn't think so, but it does. It sounds gentler and very symphonic.
I guess that's why their music endures--it's so versatile, and so mold-able.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recommend me an album from the beatles
Oh, are you just starting to get into them?
Yeah. I know John Lennon's songs, but I want to listen to more of the original beatles music. Got any recommendations?
Are you a fan of 50's rock or more groovy 60s music
I would say I'm a fan of 60s stuff
Well then i have to recommend Abbey Road. Thats the album with the famous street crossing picture
What famous songs are on the album
Well Come Together and Something is featured in the beginning
Oh I've heard Something before, and I really liked it
Then the rest of the album should suit you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
Who doesn't like the Beatles? They're the most famous band ever!
yeah. Do you have a favorite song?
I like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.
Any reason why?
I like how serene it is and carefree it makes me feel
Do you know what it's about?
I have no idea!
That's funny, I guess a lot of their songs are nonsense
Yeah, but they're happy and catchy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the most popular Beatles song?
It's either Hey Jude or I Want to Hold Your Hand.
I think their later stuff is much better than their earlier stuff.
I agree; Abbey Road is my favorite album even though has some short unfinished songs.
I'm glad that Abbey Road is their last album because Let it Be was a bit of a downer for me.
I love the song Let it Be, but that's about all from that album.
Can you imagine what it would have been like though to see them on the rooftop performing?
Much better than seeing them in Shea Stadium where you could not even hear them sing.
Who did you prefer as a singer in the Beatles?
Honestly, I preferred John.  I like his more rocking voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whenever I go home for the holidays, my Dad plays The Beatles nonstop.
Does that bug you?
No, I like The Beatles. It just makes me not feel like listening to them anywhere else.
I understand that. It's probably a lot at once.
Yeah. And my memories of most of the songs are connected to my childhood home.
So it feels wrong listening to it somewhere else?
Basically. I really do like The Beatles though.
I do too. Do you have a favorite song?
I like Norwegian Wood.
What a coincidence, me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to the Beatles?
Oh definitely! How could I not?
I love the song Twist and Shout.
That song is alright. I really like Hey Jude.
That song is fantastic.
Who is your favorite Beatle?
Paul.
Mine too!
We have so much in common!
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to listen to The Beatles?
For sure!
What is your favorite album by them?
I love the Blue Album.
Which song from that?
Penny Lane.
Great song!
I know!
I like A Day In the Life too.
Another great song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everyone seems to have a different opinion on their favorite Beatles album.
Yeah, I know a lot of people who love The White Album, but I prefer Abbey Road.
Really? Me too!
Yeah, "Something" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life.
Didn't George Harrison write that one?
Yes, he wrote it for his wife, Pattie Boyd. Both John Lennon and Paul McCartney considered it to be the best song on the entire album.
I'd have to agree with them!
Another great song from that album is "Here Comes the Sun".
Oh yeah, I love that one.
Me too. It always makes me feel better when I'm having a bad day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How influential do you think the Beatles were or are?
Very, everyone from Aerosmith to Emeinem have covered their songs.
What's your favorite Beatles song?
Eight days a week has been stuck in my head for 40 years.
Didn't the Beatles make a few movies?
Absolutely, Help and A Hard Days Night.
What year did they come to the United States?
I'm not sure but I think it was 1967 or 1968.
What television show did they appear on first.
It was either the Ed Sullivan show or the Milton Berle show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Beatles?
I know some of there songs
Do you know how influential their music was
I had no Idea
Have you ever listened to Sgt Peppers?
No, Why should I?
It changed music from just being a group of songs and turned it into a musical experience
Did't others do that too at the time
Yes but the Beatles were the true leaders
I will have to check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it true the Beatles had their own cartoon series?
Yes it is and it came on on Saturdays.
Did they use real Beatle music in the show?
Yes the cartoon series included most of their biggest hits.
I bet lunch boxes, tee shirts and other Beatle merchandise is still collectible today.
It is and if you check on the bidding auction sites you'll some of it being worth quite a bit.
I have a double cd collection of Beatle hits. You think it may be worth something?
I am sure it is but Beatles old original Lps are probably worth twice as much as the cds.
Did Paul McCarthy start another group after the Beatles group broke up?
Yes Sir Paul McCarthy did but I am not sure of the name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Its a little old school, but do you like Beatles music?
Sure do.  I went to see Beatle Mania once.
Oh how was that experience?
Sooo fun.  The music was fabulous and I got caught up in the show.
Sounds nice!  I like their earlier music myself.
Mmm-hmm.  It was good, but I like all of it.
Even towards the end when they were arguing?
John and Paul wrote some of their best music then.
Don't forget George.  LOVE "While my guitar gently weeps."
Ringo wrote a few catchy songs too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who Geoff Emmerick is?
No.
He was the Beatles' engineer.
Really? He must be talented.
He is. He helped them make a lot of the experimental sounds.
I thought George Martin was the producer.
He was, and he made a lot of contributions, but the engineer did a lot too.
I never heard of him.
Most people haven't.
It's shame, if he was really the sixth Beatle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you're a big fan of Paul McCartney, but what was your opinion of George Harrison?
I think he was very underrated to the group.  he was obviously not utilized to his fullest.
Could you provide some specifics about why you feel like that? I'm interested, because he really showed his talents, mostly, after the group broke up.
Exactly.  once the group broke up, Harrison really came into his own.  His concert for Bangla Desh, at Madison Square Garden, was one for the ages.
Very true.  Now i'm not suggesting the Beatles totally forgot about his abilities.  Consider the "Abbey Road" album; Harrison had two standouts on that one.
Yes.  more than on any other Beatles album, Harrison really came through on that one.  "Here Comes the Sun" is outstanding, and "Something" became a standard which many other artists, even Frank Sinatra, did versions of.
After the group broke up, Harrison released his "All Things Must Pass" album which almost forced people, who had previously overlooked him, to notice him.
For sure.  with that album, which was either the first or second solo album of ANY of the Beatles, Harrison was established as a mega-talent.   I'm sure it was at that point that many people felt the Beatles had not used him as they should have.
In a way i agree with that, but again, we have to keep in mind that basically it was Lennon and McCartney's group.  They had almost always given George one cut an album; no more, and no less (with the exception of "Abbey Road," as we mentioned).  It was obviously Harrison's role to be a great guitarist, sing background vocals, and leave the "heavy lifting" to Paul and John.
And to Harrison's great credit, i don't think he ever complained about that role.  Of course why would he complain? He made so much money as a member of the group, and he never had to feel the pressure of doing a lot of writing.  Yes, rest in peace George.

What do you think of the Beatles?
I like them but I have to be in the mood for it.
Do you think they deserve all the acclaim they get?
I didn't grow up listening to them.  I started listening to them when I was an adult and I think their songs are really good.
Do you have a favorite Beatles era?
Yeah.  I liked their earlier stuff.
What was wrong with their later stuff?
I thought the psychedelic music was made to push the drug culture.
Do you like "A day in the life"?
No. Not really.  I didn't like the ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Beatles recorded for the Apple Record Label didn't they?
True. I remember their 45 records had a lime green label on them.
What Beatles song was first made famous by a Motown Rnb group?
That easy, "Please Mr. Postman" was first recorded and made a hit the Motown girl group cal the Marvellets. My turn.
When the Beatles first formed there was a fifth Beatle.
There was never more than four Beatles.
Are you sure? Would you bet money on your answer?
I honestly don't remember another Beatle. Was the fifth Beatle a male or famale?
I don't know. I was just buying myself some time until I could come up with another Beatle question.
So what did you come up with "Come Together or St Jude?.."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to the Beatles?
Yes, they are one of my favorite bands.
Which one is your favorite Beatles?
I would say John Lennon is my favorite.
I would say Paul McCartney is mine.
What songs do you like from them??
I really like Strawberry Fields Forever and Yellow Submarine.
Nice, I love those two songs as well. I also like most songs from the album Help! as well.
I wish there were new music sounded like this.
I agree with you, older music is so much better than what is popular nowadays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Beatles' music so much.
It is timeless.
I can't think of another group so inspirational.
Yeah, they inspire all ages.
I love Hey Jude.  What is your favorite?
I am obsessed with Twist and Shout.
They don't have any bad songs.
You're right.
They also had such incredible voices and cohesion.
I love to dance to their music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I recently watched a documentary about the Beatles.
How was it?
It was a little long but very interesting.
Who directed it?
I think it was Ron Howard.
Oh, cool. I'll have to check it out.
You should!
I'm really interested in the relationship between the Beatles and teenage girls.
How do you mean?
Teen girls' interests are often belittled, but they were the first demographic to embrace the Beatles, who went on create a lasting legacy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me a little bit about why you like The Beatles so much. I understand your Mom liked them.
When I was little, my uncle (who lived at my grandma's house) had every single Beatles album. Grandma had a big cabinet record player/radio, and I used to listen to them on it.
So which ones did you like best? Anything in particular?
I liked The White Album, and songs like "Rocky Raccoon" and While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Clapton played on that one.
Why did Harrison have Clapton play on that one? I mean, he's not a Beatle.
Well, of course not! Apparently they tried having the group play it, but Harrison wasn't satisfied with it, and invited Clapton to play the solo, instead.
That was a good choice. So what other albums?
I liked "Help", and "The Beatles". I remember watching "Help", the movie - and knowing all the songs
Yeah, that movie was like one big video. maybe it was like one of the first movies written around rock songs.
No, now you're just ignoring greats like Elvis, who did lots of musical movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've heard people say the Beatles were the soundtrack to their childhood. What's your thoughts about that
I agree. I was ten when I saw them on ed Sullivan and was completely hooked.
Yea,it seemed they were singing to me
I know. They kind of set us apart from the mainstream
You couldn't wait for the next album and what they were going to teach or tell us
I felt exactly the same
It was such an incredible time in my life
Absolutely! To this day I credit them for guiding me through the sixties.
Ain't that the truth. Peace and Love.
That's what they were about,peace and Love!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to the Beatles?
Sometimes I do.
They had so many great songs!
It's incredible the amount of albums they put out in so few years.
What is your favorite album?
I don't have a favorite, but I liked the later stuff.
Like Abbey Road?
Yeah, that and The White Album, Rubber Soul.
What about Sgt. Pepper?
That was okay too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like Love Me Do was the Beatles best song
No way that wasnt a bad track but nowhere near the best.
So what would you say is the best?
Hey Jude.
OK I can see where you are coming from
Actually anything from Abbey Road as well.
So nothing from Peppers?
Peppers wasnt bad, but there was too much variety for me to nail a song down
I think that was the point of the album
Yeah it was a concept album in a relative sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've never really been that into the Beatles man. I do like some of their songs but I never really got the Beatles craze.
Well maybe you haven't heard enough of their songs, or realize the significance of their music for that period of time.
Well I know and like the song Imagine. I think the message and lyrics are outstanding.
So you do like them afterall. I would recommend you listen to a greatest hits album to start with.
Growing up my dad would put on a Beatles record, I forget which one it was.
Do you remember if it had the song Hard Days Night.
Yes, actually it did. I remember dancing to that song on several occasion growing up.
My favorite song has always been Love Me Do.
I really like that song too. It brings me back to that time period and how much more innocent we were.
True. I did get to see Paul McCartney in concert about 10 years back. He put on a great show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new remastered Sgt. Pepper's album?
Yeah, it's great!
What's your favorite track?
"Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"
That's a good one. My favorite is "A Day in the Life"
Yeah, I like that one too.
Sgt. Pepper's is also one of my all time favorite album covers.
Mine too. I've spent a lot of time in the past just looking at it.
By the way, who's your favorite Beatle? Mine's George.
John
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, there. Are you a Beatles fan?
Not really, although I do like some of their songs.
Which songs do you like?
I like the earlier songs, like I Want to Hold Your Hand and She Loves You.
I like all of their different phases. Have you listened to the Sgt. Pepper album?
I know a couple songs from it, like Help From My Friends, but I like Joe Cocker's version better.
No offense, but I think he ruined it. I don't like Beatles covers. Why mess with perfection?
Wow, you must be a die-hard Beatles fan.
Yes, I am. I've loved them since February, 1964 when I saw them on Ed Sullivan.
That's cool. They were a really big deal for your generation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Beatles album?
Probably 'Abbey Road'. You?
Mine would be 'The White Album'. It's a tough choice, though.
Oh I forgot about 'The White Album'! I love that one!
It's so great isn't it? It's the only 2 disc album, too.
Was that towards the end of their career?
Kind of yes. 'Abbey Road' was the last album.
With the iconic cover! I would love to go to that street one day.
Wouldn't we all? And recreate that album cover?
Exactly. Everyone knows it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
the beatles are my favorite group

he's a smart man
why cause he likes the beatles?
no cause he knows good music

XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Beatle is Ringo because I like his voice.
So do I. He sings some weird stuff, though.
I don't like that stuff. I like the love songs or the earlier stuff.
I do like 'A Little Help from my Friends.' That's Ringo.
Yeah, that one is good.
Do you like the cover they used on Wonder Years?
Not at all.
I wish they'd just used Ringo's version.
That would be better for sure.
I'd love to hear more of his stuff used in different shows and movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love that song!
What song?
The one that's playing on the radio.
I can't make it out.
It's the old Kenny Roger's song, "The Gambler."
No kidding?
Yeah. I used to sing that song every day back in high school.
Every day?  It's a good song, but singing it every day...?
I fancied myself somewhat of a maverick and a great poker player. The song was my theme song!
It still suits you. Perfect song about an old guy sitting around reminiscing and constantly telling others his opinions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What makes the Beatles music part of the British Invasion?
Well, a turnabout concept, since they were fans of American rock and roll.
Who were they fans of before they became world famous?
The Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard and other American acts.
In their earlier songs the Beatles patterned their harmony like the Everly Brothers.
That was an accomplishment considering none of the Beatles were known to be related to each other.
Please, Please Me was influenced by the vocals in Cathy's Clown.
Some of the musical chords were influenced by the same song as well.
The Beatles early on referred to themselves as the Four Everlys.
Yes. They were influenced by the Everly Brothers almost as much as Simon and Garfunkel were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen across the universe?
Do you mean heard the song? Then yes I have.
No there was a movie made called across the universe.
Never heard of it.
That is a shame. It is done to all beatles songs. I highly recommend it.
Who is in it? any actual beatles?
No, it is with actors and they sing the songs too.  Jim sturgess and Evan rachel wood  are the main two. But big ensemble cast.
Anyone else I may know?
Well selma hayeck does make an appearance as a sexy nurse.
I like her a lot. Now I really have to check it out .
XXXXXXXXXXX
Picture yourself on a boat on a river...
What are you singing?
Um. The Beatles?
Really? I've never heard that song.
Huh. It's Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds!
I guess I've only heard the songs in the musical Across the Universe
look, that was a good movie but...i'm disappointed
sorry! i'll listen to lucy next
the worst part? it was IN the movie! they just saved it for the credits
oh...well then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Some Beatles songs seem to be descriptions in the life of the Beatles.
Like what?
The first one that comes to mind is "Penny Lane."
What makes it feel like it's a real life description?
Specific details of people in the streets, and moments in time.
Like "The banker never wears a Mac in the pouring rain/very strange"?
Yes, exactly like that.
Do you know if there is actually a street called Penny Lane?
I don't know.
It would be cool to find out though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard you really enjoyed the Beatles show in Vegas.
Yes they are my favorite
Who is your favorite Beatle
John Lennon. Imagine is my favorite song of all time and In My Life is my second favorite.
What about Beatles songs?
Probably Hey Jude and Drive My Car
Do you not like Come Together?
Actually I prefer the Tina Turner cover of that song
Interesting. Is that your favorite Beatles cover.
It is and Arctic Monkeys did a good cover of it at the London Olympics too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love how the Beatles always wrote their own material. They were the ultimate songwriters.
No, not in the early part of their career.
What?!
In the early days of their career, the Beatles played a lot of cover versions, not originals.
Really? Who would they typically cover?
Actually, a lot of African American girl groups, for one thing. Think Motown, but a little earlier.
Wow, that's surprising.
Yeah, you know that song "Please Mr. Postman?" It's by the Marvelettes, but the Beatles made a cover version of it.
Did they change much?
No, not really. They even do the hand claps that the Marvelettes did, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you tell me about when the Beatles played in Nippon Budokan Hall in Japan?
Sure can. The Beatles played 5 dates there between June 30th and July, 2 1966.
How many songs were in the sets?
Each set had 11 songs clocking in at about a half hour.
Which song did they end the show with?
I`m Down which drove the crowds nuts.
There was a rumor that some Japanese didn't want the Beatles there?
True,some elders were upset the Beatles set a bad example for Japanese youth by leading them away from the traditional Japanese values.
Was there any film of this so I can watch it?
Yes,luckly The shows were filmed by Nippon Television, and broadcast as The Beatles Recital From Nippon. You can find it on Amazon or You-Tube.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who the fab four are?
Of course, they're the Beatles!
Alright, alright. I just found out today that one member of the Beatles isn't an original member.
Oh, which one? George?
No, not George.
Who then?
Ringo Starr wasn't the original drummer.
I didn't know that, who was the original drummer.
A fellow named Pete Best.
Interesting. It's such a weird counterfactual to imagine the Beatles without Ringo. No "With a Little Help from My Friends."
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughs on the Beattles?
I love the Beattles! One of my favorite groups.
Do you like the White Album?
No, not so much.  I like their older stuff better.
I love the white album.  And Sergant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
No, I like their early music better.  And I don't like their solo stuff.
No, there solo stuff is really hit or miss.
Have you seen Love in Vegas?
Yes, it's a great tribute.
I'm glad their music is more available now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the beatles made music sober
I do not think so
Why not
Do you know what time period that was
What period
The 60s you get what that was
No what was it
It was the drug Renaissance
Like everyone did drugs to make music?
That exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what has to be the absolute best song to sing along to of all time?
Oh gosh, this could go anywhere! What is it?
Hey Jude. It's so classic!
Well, it is a classic. But the best of all time?
Definitely. I mean the part at the end with the "na-na's"?
Well yeah, I have sung along to that quite a bit in my time.
The Beatles have a lot of songs that are great to sing along to as well.
I always liked to sing along with that songs that goes "I get by with a little help from my friends."
Oh that song is a great one, probably a top 10 sing along Beatles song.
The Beatles are just always great to sing along to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you familiar with the Beatles' music?
Oh yes, they are one of my favorite bands.  Do you enjoy them?
They are my absolute favorite. What's your favorite song?
Hmm, that's a hard choice but I think In My Life. You?
Ooohh, nice choice.  I think mine is Eleanor Rigsby.  What era of their music do you like the most?
Probably what they were putting out in the 70s. I like that they were getting more experimental.
Yeah, I like that era too.  I think my favorite is their beginning time in the early 60s.
Yeah, they were more pop. One of the original boy bands, haha.
Yep, gotta love those classic early songs.
I agree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beatles are overrated.
What? Why do you say that?
I mean, there are better bands out there.
Like who?
The Who! Exactly. They're way better.
Not The Who. I meant who, like "guess who?"
The Guess Who? They're even better!
Dude, that's not what I meant.
I'm saying they're better than the Beatles
Who?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you rate the Beatles as the greatest rock band of all time?
Probably.  One could make that argument based upon the sheer volume of their work, its success in the market and how they remain relevant today.
Yes, and they produced such a variety of music, too.
Definitely.  One of their great talents was how varied their music could be.
John and Paul were fortunate to have each other.  I think the music they produced when together was much better than what they did as solo artists.
Yes, I agree.  Some of Paul's music after the Beatles was downright sappy.
Yes, the Silly Little Love song crap versus great songs like All My Loving, Here, There and Everywhere, For No One, Blackbird to name a few.  He was downright prolific in that short time.
Yes, and John, too.  Songs like A Day in Life, Girl, In My Life, No Reply to name a few.
Yes, and let's not forget George.  He was more of a late bloomer, but Something and Here Comes the Sun are masterpieces.
Yes, and when the Beatles broke up he seemed to have the best unreleased catalogue at the time given the All Things Must Pass album.
