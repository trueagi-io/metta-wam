So would you classify it as a comedy?
No, I wouldn't say it was a comedy. It was more so subliminal jokes.
Oh, I see. Is it scary enough that I need a friend with me?
No, it's not that bad at all.
Ok, I think I'm going to check it out.
You should! I wactually watched it twice.
Why did you watch it twice? It was that good?
I just kept reading that you pick up on more of the subliminal messages after you watch it a second time.
Well did you?
I did! I guess they kind of went over my head at first for some reason.

What makes a good thriller movie?
I like thriller movies that have a lot of suspence
Like they make your skin crawl as you wait?
Yeah that's the feeling!
What movies make you feel really anxious as you watch them?
In a good way?
Oh course in a good way! That's why I want to watch it!
Oh okay. I really liked 10 Cloverfield Lane, it makes you want to scream
What's the most tense part of the movie
The whole movie is tense, you don
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Memento?
Yes! That's a great thriller.
That movie just kept me guessing the whole time.
I had to watch it twice.  It took me a long time to realize it was going on backwards.
I was really suprised that he had already killed his wife's killer.
Me too.  I was really sad at the end.
I'm glad they didn't make a sequel.
Or a prequel.
It was very suspensful.
And very dramatic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good thriller movies lately?
Yes!  I saw recently saw that movie "Annabelle".
Ooooh!  That's the one about the doll right?
Yes!  It was really creepy and kept me on the edge of my seat.
The scene at the beginning with the crayons in the hallway totally freaked me out.
Yeah and when the doll kept coming back after they tried to get rid of it...scared me so much!
Did you see that they are making a prequel to that movie?
No way!  Really?
Yes, it's called Annabelle: Creation.  I cannot wait.
Oh wow!  I'm excited for that one too.  I hope it's just as good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seven was the creepiest movie ever.
It's actually got a 7 in it.
Huh?  What do you mean.
The title of the movie is actually Se7en.  It has the number 7 instead of a v.
That's odd.  I get it, but still odd.
I winced at the ending for sure.
It's not every day you find your wife's head in a box and learned she was pregnant.
That was genuinely screwed up.
That was the point though.  It wasn't a happy ending movie at all.
I wish they would make more like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Favorite Liam Neeson film?
I'd say Taken
Yea, I'd agree.
I liked the first one, but the second was kinda bad.
I try to ignore that sequel.
The first one had so many good one liners
The fan reactions to that movie were pretty good!
I hope one day, he and jason bourne team up.
That would be an epic movie
Fighting spies and saving kidnapped women, what else do you need in a movie?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
I like some like The Dark Knight Rises does that count?
I think so it was very intense. that's a good one.
Inception too was another one I liked.
Oh ya that was such a confusing movie at first.
Ya I agree it really was.
What about ones that are a little scarier like The Silence of the Lambs.
Thats a great movie but it freaks me out a little.
Ya it's so intense with the kidnappings.
Exactly. It reminds me of the movie Seven.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of your favorite thriller films?
Wow, my favorites? I could go on forever. There are so many!
Okay, just tell me your all time favorite then.
Well, I do love The Bad Seed.
I've never heard of that one.
It's a black and white film from 1956, really a great one.
What's it all about?
It's a psychological thriller about a little girl who is born with the killer instinct. The movie discusses whether genetics or environment play a part in how a person turns out.
That sounds pretty deep, does the movie get boring?
Not at all, the little girl is so evil and engaging that it flows together seamlessly with the psychology.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thrillers?
Yes they are enjoyable
Have you seen the call?
Yes that was a good movie
My boyfriend made me watch jt
Did you like it
Yes i did
Thats good
I was suprised
You didnt think youd like it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Strangers on a Train is definitely my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films.
I don't believe I've heard of that one.
You haven't? You need to check it out. It's very good.
I will. You haven't asked me which Hitchcock film I liked the best.
I can guess. Psycho, right?
Wrong. Rear Window.
Oh, good choice. That's my second favorite.
Psycho's my second favorite Hitchcock film.
I think you'll change your mine after you watch Strangers on a Train with me.
I doubt that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Black Swan.
Never saw it.  Who's in it?
Natalie Portman as a ballerina.
Neat.  Who directed?
Darren Aronofsky.
What's the plot?
Natalie Portman competes for the role of the black swan in Swan Lake.
Cool.  What happens in the end?
She kills another dancer, nails the performance but dies in the end.
Sounds cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last thriller movie you've seen?
I just finished Fracture. It was a great movie.
I don't think I have heard of Fracture. What is it about?
It's about an attorney who is about to get a high paying job but first has to defend a guy charged with murder.
Sounds interesting.
It stars Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.
Is Ryan the murderer?
No, he plays the young attorney. It has some great twists in it.
I will have to watch it.
You can buy it on Amazon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Horror movie franchise or one that's always stoodout to you?
The Nightmare on Elm Street movies were always great to me, how about you?
To be honest, that was going to be my response as well! What was your favorite movie from the series?
I don't think you are going to top the original. That was great stuff.
Agreed. I feel the first and third were by far, the best.
Those were before Freddy Krueger became a bit more silly and he was still a very scary force.
I always felt the third movie was a good blend of dark humor and horror.
Definitely. That was where the one-liners were first introduced, but not necessarily being over-done at that point.
Agreed. At the end of the day, Freddy Krueger is one of the greatest horror icons ever.
For sure. Robert Englund is the only man who can play that character, in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went and  saw  split  yesterday .
Is that the one about the  guy  with  alot of   different personalties ?
It is  and he  kidnaps a   few young  girls .
So  does  he  seem  belivable  as  so many  different personalities ?
He does in a  way the only one  I  struggled  with was one  where he  was  called the  beast
Did it  cross over into  any of the other movies like  signs ?
In the  end  you do  see  bruce  willis  character  from unbreakable
So  are they going to  do  one  crossing  all these  stories  together  ?
I think they could  it  would  just be  very hard  .
We  will just have  to  wait  and  see then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Talented Mr. Ripley?
Not sure. Who's in it?
Matt Damon is the lead.
What is it about?
It's kind of hard to explain.
Give it a try.
This kid infiltrates this group of high society types and starts manipulating them.
Oh, yeah. Very weird.
Probably some of Damon's best work.
He was a great sociopath!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really love the suspense on those movies.
Yes, I love to be surprised at what will happen next.
I agree, unexpected twists are my favorite.
Me too, I hate it when you can guess totally what is going to happen every time.
I also love those surprise, knock you out of your seat fright moments.
I love them, and I hate them at the same time.
It is really an impact when you see these in the theater.
I know, and then half the audience gasps or jumps and you're a part of the group.
My only problem is remembering they are only movies when I walk out.
Yes, I'm usually pretty jumpy for a while after watching one of those movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie "The Sixth Sense"?
Yeah, that made a lot of buzz when it came out.
I was really afraid of it when I was younger.
Me too. That tent scene was creepy.
I think the concept was fresh territory back then, too.
Any scary movie that involves a child creeps me out.
Especially one that communicates with the dead.
It was cool to see Bruce Willis in a film like that.
He played a convincing father role. I thought he was great.
Me too. You don't usually see actors of that caliber in thriller movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies?
Yes I love them.
What about thrillers?
Yes
Me too
I like secret window, smart people next, stuff like that
I reslly like next with nicolas cage
Me too
I wish they came out with more than one
Same
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie Identity?
Vaguely.  What was it about again?
This was the one where a bunch of strangers kept dying at a hotel in a storm.
Oh, okay, had John Cusack in it I think.
Right.  This is where you found that the characters didn't exist.
Yes, they were figments of the prisoners imagination.
Split personalities basically.  I thought it was a good plot device.
It was an interesting take on the film for sure.
In the end, I think the prisoner ends up still going crazy, doesn't he?
Yeah, crashes the van and kills some workers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw A Perfect Murder.
Wasn't that a remake of Dial M for Murder?
Yes, it was.
Who directed it?
Andrew Davis.
No Hitchcock, I'm sure.
Not a bad job, though.
Who's in it?
Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow,  Viggo Mortensen.
Some pretty good folks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the Fugitive with Harrison Ford?
No, what is it about?
Well it is about a fugitive, on the run from the law.
Harrison Ford is the fugitive?
Well I would not want to spoil it for you, but it is super thrilling to watch.
Is it an older movie?
Yes but it is still one of the best of all time.
Wow that sounds great.
Yes it really is.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What' the best thriller movie you have seen lately?
That would have to be John Wick: Chapter 2.
Okay, that's a good one, you'd think people would learn and leave John alone.
Yeah, you would, but some guy decides to get John back into the assassin gam and then double crosses him.
ANd I think we all know how that's going to turn out.
Yep, John kills all the bad guy's goons and then takes out the big man himself.
Really, you'd think people would stop underestimating a guy who wiped out all his competitors in one night.
That's was the impossible task VIggo gave him, so he could leave the organization?
That's what it seems to be, wipe out all the competitons top guns and you can leave, that's the deal.
Man, know wonder they nicknamed him the Boogeyman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen shutter island?
I have I enjoyed it but not as much as the book.
I didn't even realize it was a book first. I wish I would have read it before viewing the film.
Hard to say what is better because you may have enjoyed the film more not knowing the twist first.
That is true, it is a different movie watching it a second or third time, knowing what happens.
Exactly, even though I knew the twist.. I still really enjoyed this film overall.
I thought the best performance outside of Leo was Mark Ruffalo.
Mark Ruffalo was superb, I feel he doesn't always get due credit for his acting chops.
True he may be underappreciated in hollywood.
Or maybe by audiences since he is rarely the main draw, he may get overlooked for people like leo, super a-list.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Grey.
Yea, the one with Liam Neeson right?
Yea, when he gets hunted by those wolves.
That movie was so good.
Yea but it was really scary.
Definitely. That would suck if that happened to you.
Yea, but I guess it's not as bad if you've got the skills like Liam Neeson had.
Well, it's still pretty bad, he died at the end.
You don't know that for sure.
It's implied though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Don't Breathe last night.
Never heard of it.  Any good?
Yes, it was suspenseful.
Who is the director?
Fede Álvarez
What happens?
Three punks break into a blind man's home to rob him.
Sounds heartless.
They get their due, though.
Good. I might look it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever seen Sin City?
Yes! That was awesome.
Yeah, plot twist everywhere.
Yeah, good ending too.
I liked the guy Mickey Rourke played.
That was a good character.  Pretty tough too.
Bruce Willis was awesome in that movie too.
Like when he "took away his weapon."
Yeah, "Both of them"
One of my favorite parts that guy getting what he just deserved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you seen the movie Hanna?
No, but I saw the promos for it. What is it about.
Well, the title character Hanna is a young girl raised by a former CIA agent, who taught her how to be an assassin.
Okay, that sounds a little warped.
Well, Hanna is the result of CIA program to produce super soldier's throught genetic enhancement of children in the womb.
Okay, so he's training her to be an agent?
No, he's training her to survive, because the program was terminated and all test subjects destroyed, save Hanna.
Ah, so Hanna is learning to fight so she can stay alive if and when the CIA discovers she's still alive.
Yes, pretty much and the that's what the film is about.
Okay, I'll definitely find time to watch this film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick a thriller film that set the bar for all future thriller movies, which movie would you chose?
Hands down it would be Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.
Oh that shower scene is such a classic.
And the music that was played was so creepy.
I loved the twist that Norman was actually also his mother.
I didn't see that coming.
I don't think anyone did.
Janet Leigh did a really good acting job in that movie.
So did Anthony Perkins.
Alfred Hitchcock really put the movie on the map with his directing skills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
I have to say "Get Out" was exceptionally good.
Everyone loved that movie.
I can't deny it. It will be a welcome addition to my thriller collection.
What did you like most about it?
I really loved the idea of the sunken place.
I agree. That was a really cool concept.
I also really loved the focus they put on the fear that we express through our eyes.
The "deer in the headlights" look was a recurring theme in the movie, come to think of it.
Yeah, and they hit a deer in the beginning. It had awesome foreshadowing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Steven Spielberg movies?
I do. I'm a big fan of thrillers so I like his thrillers the best.
Oh really? Like which ones?
Well, he did a TV movie called Duel a long time ago with Dennis Weaver. It was one of his first films.
Is that the one about the guy being chased by the evil truck?
That's the one, for sure. Pretty suspenseful. Also a good reminder to keep your road rage in check.
And I think Catch Me If You Can is a thriller too, kind of.
Yeah, I agree. Kind of a thriller/biography.
And War Of The Worlds. Would that qualify?
I suppose. A science fiction thriller, for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know which Hitchcock movie I love is North by Northwest.
That's a great one Cary Grant is in that one right?
Yes and they mistake him for someone else and he has to run.
Yes that one has some great locations like when he is on Mount Rushmore.
Yes that is a great scene.
I always liked Strangers on a Train
Oh ya that's a good one too with Robert Walker.
Yes where they each have someone they want murdered so they agree to murder the others person.
Yes only one of them changers there mind.
Yes I think there have been a few movies that have used that idea for their movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of your favorite psychological thrillers?
have always enjoyed movies like Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, Black Swan.
That is a wide range.
Yes, but I have never really sought out anything too similar.
I know a few in the same sort of mixed style thriller.
What movies would you recommend?
Prisoners, with Hugh Jackman.
Is it good?
I think it is one of his best performances.
I like his thriller movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you happen to like Thriller movies?
They are alright.
What have you seen recently?
I saw the movie The Visit.
Oh that movie looked creepy.
It kind of was.
Who was in that again?
Olivia De Jonge.
Oh I have not heard of her.
She is not that famous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new thriller action movie John Wick 2?
I have seen it. Great movie.
What was your favorite part?
I liked the scene when they shooting in the tunnel.
It was so cool how he hid all those guns in the tunnel.
I know. When I first saw him hiding them I was wondering why.
I think those people would have hearing damage shooting in such a small area.
It's a movie we aren't supposed to worry about the details.
It was a very cool scene just bothered me that no one seemed to be affected by the noise.
True that many guns being shot would really hurt and damage the ears.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever see The Shining?
Yes that was some movie.
Yes Jack Nicholson goes nuts.
For sure he plays a good psycho.
What about Thinner you see that one?
Yes that was great.
Yes that guy got so thin and ate everything in that movie.
Then gave the curse to his wife and daughter.
I like Kari Wuhrer.
Yeah me too. She was on my soap opera for a little while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite thriller-type movie?
Tough to pick, but probably 'The Usual Suspects'.
With Kevin Spacey? That movie is so amazing.
I paid such close attention the whole movie and I STILL didn't see the twist coming!
That's the mark of a great thriller, though. I didn't see the twist coming in 'The Prestige'.
Is that the magic one with Christian Bale?
Yep, that's right.
I've only seen that once but I remember it really blew me away.
The same director did 'Inception' too.
I saw that in the cinema and it was so gripping.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you had a chance to see gone girl?
yes i did, it was crazy
so many twists and turns, i haven't seen an honest to goodness thriller like that in a while
totally. it was a psychological thriller!
that was pretty intense movie, not exactly something you want to watch if you wanted to unwind
no kidding, the Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) really had me on edge as the story progressed
did you find that believable though?
I mean not really, but it was still a somewhat original flick
the elaborateness of all of it is what was impressive
yes, it would have been close to impossible to pull off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the 1960 movie called"Night of the Living Dead"?
Yes! it was a good movie.
There a thousands of zombie movies, but "Night of the Living dead"is the first real zombie movie.
Have you seen the movie called "Dawn of the Dead" that is a good movie to watch?
Yes!,is it  about those people getting trap in a building while the zombies are trying to get in?
Yes,there is a movie called "Zombie Land" that is suppose to be good.
I do not look at zombie movies a lot, I like Vampire movies best.
There are a couple of good werewolf movies to watch, one is called "Werewolf".
I saw that movie it was good,dId you see the movie "An American Werewolf in London"?
Yea, I saw that movie it is real scary, there are several other great werewolf movies you might want to check out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The first Die Hard movie was awesome to watch on Netflix.
Man, I can't believe that came out 30 years ago or whatever.
It still hold up relatively well.
It's got a good premise: trapped in a building surrounded by terrorists.
But they should know you never mess with John McClane.
He pretty much took them out one by one.
The best was the ending scene where Hans fell off the building.
Yeah, one of the best villain deaths ever.
Kind of a shame the rest of the movies weren't up to par.
But at least this one was tight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever feel like you wanted to talk to someone about certain movies because you like conversing about how good they where.
Yes i know the feeling it feels good right and makes you think alot what movie do you want to chat with me about?
I would like to talk about this Thriller movie called Piranha it was also a scary movie.
Oh yeah i saw that it was about killer fish starring Julie Forester and Elisabeth Shue right.
Yes they were on this island called lake Victoria and all the children were there and they were all enjoying the summer at the lake.
And they decided to have parties on the lake and peoples bodies were ending up getting eaten inside the lake.
So the sheriff of the town had to get together with the beach attendants and find a way to destroy them.
Yes they told everyone to stay out of the water and began coming up with plans to destroy the Piranha fish.
So they had to figure out how to rid them so that the lake would become safe enough again to go back into the water. At the end they lead the head leader Piranha to the boats.
And they tricked them into thinking they were going to have some more dinner by eating people and the sheriff and the captain teamed up and blew them away. .
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Silence of the Lambs
A classic!
For sure!
Have you seen the sequel?
Yea, "Hannibal" was disturbing
You mean the brain eating scene?
Oh, yes!  Who makes someone eat their own brain!?
Is that even possible?
Disturingly, I think so....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Maybe it's just me, the The Sixth Sense is so overrated.
I wouldn't say overrated, just not as memorable as most think.
It's really just a twist ending and that's about it.
The rest of the movie is kind of forgettable.
And super slow.  How would he not know he's dead?
Yeah, I agree.
And doesn't he take showers?  Go to bed?  How would he not know he's bleeding?
It doesn't make sense if you really start thinking about it.
So a neat trick at the end, but not plausible.
That would be accurate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever end up seeing "Don't Breathe".
I'm not sure I know what movie that is.
It's the thriller movie where they break into a blind veteran's house.
Oh, now I remember. Was it any good?
It wasn't that great. It's a shame because I thought the concept was amazing.
Yeah, the trailer looked like it had some intense moments.
There were a lot of "jump scares" in the movie. The acting was pretty bad, though.
Yeah, scary movies sometimes suffer from that.
It was cool to see the main villain have a handicap like that, though.
Yeah, usually they're just super powerful. It sounds unique in that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why am I able to watch Pulp Fiction so many times in a row?
Because its a really good movie!!!
There are so many good scenes
And the actors are all amazing, Samuel L Jackson was my favorite.
I liked how they had so many storylines but they all fit together.
The very beginning diner scene was well done, and they tied it to the end really well.
John Travolta was also a good part of the movie
I liked how their small conversations were so memorable.
The details of that movie are why its so easy to rewatch.
The action scenes were very well done too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie "Double Jeopardy?"
No, I haven't.  What is it?
It's one of my favorite thriller movies.  It stars Ashley Judd.
I like Ashley Judd.  I haven't seen her in much lately.
Me too.  In this movie, she plays a woman whose husband sets her up for his murder, and she goes to jail.
That sounds really interesting.  Tell me more.
When she finds out that he is still alive, she sets out to kill him because she can't be convicted twice for the same crime.
That sounds exciting.  I guess that's where the title "Double Jeopardy" comes into play.
Yes, it is.  Tommy Lee Jones also stars as a federal marshall who is trying to track down the Ashley Judd character. It is a really exciting movie.
It sounds really good.  I will have to check it out.  Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Silence of the Lambs is one of my favorite older thriller movies. Have you ever seen it , Robert?
Yes, it is one of my favorites too! Jody Foster and Anthony Hopkins are in that one.
I am a huge Anthony Hopkins fan!
Oh yeah, he rocks.
What is your favorite part of the movie?
My favorite part would be when Anthony, or Hannibal as he plays him, escapes.
It is terrible how he portrays the eating of human brains by Hannibal.
Hannibal ate anything he wanted!
Yesm it is hard to sit through some of it.
Gives me nightmares if  I watch it too late at night!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Suggest a decent thriller movie to me.
I thought "10 Cloverfield Lane" was good for how little press it received.
What's it like?
It's a bit of a sci-fi thriller. It kind of reminds me of "The Village".
That's awesome. Is it scary?
I wouldn't say outright horrifying. It is creepy though.
I will add it to my list. Will I understand it if I haven't seen Cloverfield?
Yeah, they actually have nearly nothing to do with eachother.
Really? I always thought it was a sequel.
Not really at all. It's completely a movie that can stand on it's own.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite classic thrillers?
There are a few, but maybe Psycho.
What is that one?
It is the film that introduced us to Norman Bates.
That is the one with the guy with the mommy issues?
Yes. It is also the first film to show a flushing toilet.
That is an Alfred Hitchock film right?
Yes. One of his most famous.
Why was it in black and white, a lot of his films were in color.
It was not allowed to be shown in color, due to the graphic nature of the thriller scenes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm having a few friends over tonight nad we want to watch a thriller. I don't normally watch thrillers so can you recommend something?
I have a great one in mind if you don't mind a bit of an older movie.
I'm OK with that. What's it called?
It's called The Da Vinci Code.
Who's in it?
It stars Tom Hanks.
I really like Tom Hanks. Is it scary?
Not real scary, but more tense.
I'll go find a trailer for it.
Let me know what you think and if you like it, it has a follow up called Angels and Demons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
John Wick
I love that movie!
Have you seen the sequal?
No, but I heard that it is awesome!
Yea me too!  Have you seen the video about John Wick with a nerf gun?
No, what's that about?
It bascially is a guy looking like John Wick that takes out a ton of kids at a Nerf war.  It's rather violent looking and overkill vs kids.
Sounds funny!
Oh it is!  google it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have never seen a truly scary movie.
Never?
Not one.
Why?
Well, I try to watch them, but I always fall asleep before they get interesting.
What are you, sleep narcoleptic?
No. I just get bored during the beginning of the movies, before the storyline gets thrilling.
Then you need to watch "The Dark Knight Rises"
The Dark Knight Rises?
That's right! You won't fall asleep during that one...I guarrentee!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Fight Club?
Did I? That's one of my favorite movies ever, it's so clever.
The writing is great, the plot, the dialogue, everything.
They even had a great twist at the end.
Finding out that he was actually Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt's character, must have been a shock for him.
Right because he was basically his exact opposite.
I believe he was a mix of all his suppressed desires.
Right, Tyler was everything he wanted to be but was afraid to.
It's amazing how our subconscious works. This movie does a great job of walking us through that type of mental illness.
First rule of Fight Club: We don't talk about Fight Club.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What type of movie do you want to see tonight?
I think something scary but not too gory or stupid.
You mean like a thriller?
What's the difference between a thriller and a horror?
They aren't really that much different, except a horror movie is more about graphic depictions of violence and blood.
I would rather be spooked or scared than grossed out or horrified. I don't get why people enjoy watching people get mangled and mutilated.
Me either.
Are there any good thriller movies that came out lately?
The only good one that I thought was frightening was "The Babadook."
Really? That sounds like a kid's movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Keanu Reeves?
Yes of course, who doesn't?
Did you see one of movies from the 90's, the Game?
I don't think so.
It is also starring Michael Douglas.
Oh I think I have heard about it.
It is truly thrilling.
What is it about?
There is a lawyer, going back and forth from the big town and small town, it is a great story.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you ever seen insomnia?
Yes actually. I am a big robin wiliam's fan.
I see. very different role for him though, no?
He has had a few darker roles like this but few and far between. I liked that Christopher Nolan didn't type cast him or not cast him at all.
Christopher Nolan is such a wise man, he makes such smart choices for his films.
I do love christopher nolan,  But I feel like this is one of his weaker films.
I enjoyed this movie a lot. But I did feel maybe it was slightly long or the pacing could have been faster.
It is weird how some thrillers are so fast paced but others have the long build up and can be equally successful or good.
True, I suppose it is just a different approach to the film and film making process.
If all thrillers were the same they would be predictable and boring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite thriller movie?
I liked Silence of the Lambs.
That was a pretty good, Anthony Hopkins was amazing as Hannibal Lecter.
Yeah he was.  One of the best movie bad guy of all time.
I love his epic escape too.  That was awesome when he took that face off.
Yeah, he had everyone fooled.
Jody Foster was amazing as well.
Yeah, she won an Oscar for that film.
Didn't they sweep the Oscars that year?
Yes they did.  All five, best picture, best actor, best actress, best screenplay, best director.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I did not know Robert Downey Jr. was in a few thriller movies.
There is one called Zodiac.
I seen that one today.
It is a real thriller, kept me on the edge of my seat.
He seemed so smart in the film.
Always so close to figuring the ciphers out.
I did not even know that was based on true events.
Yep, that is what made the movie so raw.
I wonder if they will ever make a sequel to that.
I do not think so, as they have never caught the bad guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Nightmare On Elm Street
One...two... Freddy's comming for you!
Haha!  Yea, it has some great scenes
Honestly the entire series is great!
Yea, except for Freddy VS Jason
Yea, that was just some rediculous fight where nobody could even win
Exactly!
But I dont see it as actually pat of the series
Yea, it's more of a spinoff!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Mystic River?
That's the one with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon?
Yeah, that's the one.
I saw it. It was good.
I read the book, then when the movie came out I just had to see it.
Was it just like the book?
Almost word for word. When I read the book I could picture everything that was happening,
It was messed up how the two kids are the one's that killed his daughter.
I know right. He jumped the gun thinking that his friend killed her.
Yeah, that part was messed up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have seen that one horror thriller type movie called The Gallows?
Yeah I saw that one. It's about a boy named Charlie who accidentally got hung in a school play.
Yeah it was a really creepy movie. It has an indie feel to it as well from the way they filmed it.
I know. I loved the way the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Also one of the Actresses is Kathy Lee Gifford's daughter. Her name is Cassidy.
I didn't know that. I did think it was interesting all the actors had the same first name as their characters as in real life.
I think I want to buy the movie for sure.
I would definitely get it. The directors were amazing at making this film.
Yeah Travis Cluff and Chris Lofing both directed and wrote the story.
I look forward to seeing more movies about these guys or even a sequel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mary, have you ever seen Gone Girl?
I have not seen that thriller yet.  Who plays in it?
Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck play in as a married couple that go through some hard times.  The woman comes up missing.
Sounds pretty cool.  Did they ever find her?
Well yes, but it has a twist to it.  She is not all she seems to be.
So she is deviant?
Yes , she is not the best person, she turns out to be setting it all up herself.
Does she end up hurting her husband?
No, she leaves him alone, he is the only one that really know her.
Sounds fun, I will have to rent it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
It would not be a movie, but a series, the Scream series.
Oh I remember those.
They are such suspenseful and gives me thrills.
I agree.  I liked the very first one.
Me too.  It was the scariest and featured Carmen Elektra getting killed?
How did she die?
At the beginning of the movie she was stabbed by the person in the scream outfit.
Oh I remember now.  That was sad but gruesome.
Yea, as the movie went on it gave the audience plenty of thrills and chills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you seen the movie "Silence of the Lambs"?
No, I heard of it but never seen it.
Oh my, you have to see it with Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
What was it about?
Jodie Foster played an FBI agent looking into murders behind a serial killer and uses information obtained from interviewing a psychopathic psychiatrist to find the killer.
Oh right that's Hannibal the cannibal right?
Yes that is right Dr. Hannibal Lecter like to eat his patients.
Gross, is there any memorable lines from the movie?
"Hell Clarice." That is one of the more chilling lines the way he says hello to her before he even sees her because he can smell her.
I will have to see this now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What thriller films  have you watched lately?
The Hills Have Eyes. Wes Craven really has some good movies
I hate that movie. That one is so scary. Kathleen Quinlan was really good in it.
Yea it was pretty bad. Even scary to me and I love those type of movies.
Not me. Thrillers are not my cup of tea.
Well sometimes they can be pretty scary, how about Children of the Corn?
That is another that I hated. I just cannot watch those kind of movies.
Well, I guess some people can and some can't.
I can't. I cannot get them out of my mind after I watch them.
Well better to stay away from them then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Shutter Island?
Yes, I think so, but it has been a while.
I saw it this weekend, it was really good!
Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play in this movie. It is a thriller for sure.
It is definitely an intense mystery and suspense. A woman goes missing on an island hospital and detectives work to find out what happened.
Yes, it was really good, I found myself pretty shocked in the end, it was a twist ending.
Yes, I couldn't believe Leonardo's character was killed in the end, he never gets off that island.
It takes you through a lot of scenes, you aren't sure what is going on until the end.
Yes, it was a maze of the mind, kept you guessing.
I may watch it again soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is The Conversation a very good movie?
Yes, it is one of Francis Ford Coppola's lesser known movies.
Who is in it?
Gene Hackman and John Cazale
Wow. John Cazale is in a lot of good films.
This one is probably the most thrilling though.
Was Gene Hackman in The French Connection as well?
Yes
That one was thrilling
I loved the car chase
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Children of the Corn?
Most of them, yes. Why?
I saw something that reminded me of it and was debating whether to make a reference you might not get.
Oh I love those movies! The original, and the one with the college students are my 2 favourites.
Did they do a good job adapting them from the books do you think?
I thought yes, absolutely. I love the short story, but it didn't last nearly long enough for me so I was glad to have a movie that would drag it out.
It does seem like it could be incredibly short, doesn't it?
Yeah, but all the waiting and slower scenes only help it I think. Instead of gimmicks like jump scares and using music to pretend something scary's about to happen, it builds up suspense.
Yeah, I see what you mean. It's like what doesn't happen is just important as what does.
Exactly. And I feel like in those quieter scenes you get to absorb the landscape, the wardrobe, the props and everything that you may have envisioned while reading the book, and it lends itself well to the overall feeling of the story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What good thrillers have you seen recently?
I liked the new Jason Bourne movie.
I love that franchise. The special effects and chase scenes are fantastic.
I think Matt Damon did a really good job in it.
Do you have a favorite thriller of all time?
The Usual Suspects would top my list for sure.
I loved that movie. I was very surprised at the ending.
I also loved the Sixth Sense.
That's another movie that had me fooled until the very end.
Yes, I loved that twist as well. He's done a few other fantastic movies with surprise endings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see 127 Hours?
Doesn't strike a bell.
It's the one where the guy cuts off his arm because he trapped himself in a canyon.
Oh, I remember now.  That was based off a true story.
It was pretty amazing he somehow lived through that.
Can you imagine what it would be like trying to cut off your own arm?
I couldn't do it.
Most people probably couldn't.  He did it with a little knife.
It's a wonder he didn't die.  You should probably watch it again sometime.
I think I need to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i saw The Silence of the Lambs on demand last night.
That's a classic.  I loved Jodie Foster with brown hair.
And the Virginia accent!
Anthony Hopkins was superb in that movie.
Oh yes.  I loved how he got free.
Ted Levine was cool as Buffalo Bill.
I loved the pit.
My favorite was the lights out scene.
Right, with Jodie breathing hard.
The sequels/prequels were not even close.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know this is an old movie, but have you seen Sixth Sense?
Oh my gosh, yes.  That is one of my all-time favorites.
"I see dead people" is still one of the scariest movie lines ever.
That's for sure.
Were you surprised at the end?
Yes.  I had no idea that the Bruce Willis character was dead.
I figured it out at the beginning.
How did you know?
My niece pointed out that he had the same shirt on he was wearing when he was shot.  That's when I knew.
Really?  I never even noticed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That Jodi Foster movie in the room really threw me for a loop.
Panic Room?
Yep, wow that had a lot of thrills.
You spend the first half thinking they are after her.
But then come to find out it is not.
No, they want something in the house.
I think the little girl acted really well in that film.
Sarah?
Her, I believed her fear the whole time.
That was one of Kristen Stewart's first acting roles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Titantic?
Yes
Where did the movie take place?
A cruise ship.
What era?
The 1900's
Was the movie romantic?
Yes
Did a lot of people die?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you familiar with Korean films?
Not really.  I am totally unfamiliar with them.
You should check out the movie, 'Old Boy.'
What is it about?
It's about a man who is locked up in a hotel room-jail cell for 15 years without knowing why he was there.
The whole movie takes place there?
No, he gets out after 15 years.  The rest of the movie is him trying to find out what happens, and also get revenge.
I want to look this movie up.  What is the name of the director?
The director's name is Park Chan-wook.  Also, there was an American remake of the movie in 2013.
I will have to see both of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Ghost Dog, the movie?
No I've never even heard about it.
It is really great.
What is it about?
It is about the street samurai type guy, stoic yet intelligent and caring.
That is an interesting premise to a movie.
Yes and there is even a little bit of the Wu Tang Clan in it.
Ah I have heard of them.
The movie is truly unique, a great look at a man's life.
Wow that sounds great, thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like scary movies?
Yes, I love them!
Well then you should watch this new one that came out
What is it called?
omen
isn't that an old movie?
no, it was remade and it is way scarier
Hmm, okay I will try it out!
Great, do you want to see it with me?
Yeah I would like to!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen mr and mrs smith?
With brad pitt and angelina jo li
Yes thats the one
It was really good
I really liked it
I love spy movies like that
Me too
I wish they made more movies like that
So do i
It would be fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the accountant?
Which one was that again?
Ben Affleck's recent thriller, he was a hit-man.
Oh right, that one was incredible.
I want a trailer like that one day.
You and everybody else, I just want a painting like that over my bed.
My favorite scene was when he was shooting the cantaloupes on the farm.
They faces he drew on there made me laugh.
I liked it because of the farmer watching him, the look on his face when he hit them.
He was definitely in shock, then Affleck just waves at him like nothing even happened.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Fight Club?
Yes. That's one of the greatest movies ever.
I agree. No matter how many times I've seen it, I can always watch it again.
The concept for that movie was so ahead of it's time.
Right? I was so confused by the ending the first time I saw it.
I never expected the split personalities either.
I researched the movie online, and there were certain hints that gave it away early.
I've seen that, too. The characters swapping places for like a split second.
It would be really hard to catch unless you slowed it down.
Definitely. It was a really cool creative decision, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Prestige?
Yeah, awesome movie.  Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were awesome.
Yeah, kept you guessing the whole time.
I know, turns out it was just a trick from Bale's character.
But Hugh Jackman took it so far and did strange things.
Yeah, and the clues of course were always there.
Yeah, just like you see at the end.
I also liked how they had that long standing rivalry.
Yeah, and how they talked about the importance of showmanship.
Yeah, that was pretty cool.  I wish I knew some good magic tricks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Grindhouse?
Yeah, it was really good.  I liked how Teritino made the movie quality the way he did.
Yeah, it was a good device.
It started out kind of slow, but Quenton Territono always does a good job of getting a good movie out of no where.
Yeah, like right after the part where the film messed up.
Yeah, then somehow everyone knew who this guy was and he was a total stud.
Yeah, and the machine gun leg on his girlfriend was pretty cool too
Ironic that they needed to get to Mexico the whole time.
The ending was oddly happy too.
Yeah, with her having the little daughter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rosemary's Baby is one of my favorite thrillers.
Really? Why's that?
There aren't any real "jump scares."
So it's not scary?
It is, but because everything that is normal in Rosemary's world slowly becomes strange an ominous.
Like her life has never been normal?
Yeah, it's scary to think of it happening to me.
Do you get to see the baby?
Not really; they more describe it than show it.
That sounds scarier.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like thrillers?
Thriller movies?
Yes.
Yeah I enjoy them.
They are great to watch in the theaters.
Yeah I love it.  It's so tense.
That is a big draw to these kinds of films for me.
Yeah the tenseness of it I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this new thriller movie blows
What one
The mummy
Oh why does it suck?
Well it is nowhere near as good as the old ones
They should have kept it campy like the old one
The old old one or the brendan frasier one
The Frasier one
I was about to correct you
I know man
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love thrilling movies
Are they not pretty cool
Yeah
They keep you on your toes
Precisely what  i want
Exactly
You know because it is exciting
Yep pretty much
I would love to make one myself
That would be cools
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Inception?
No but I have heard of it.
You should watch it.
Why should I?
It is a really smart movie that is truly unique in many ways.
How is that?
They discuss dreams and reality like no other movie.
Ok that sounds interesting.
The movie is truly unique and special, give it a watch.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Mad Max?
Yes, it kept me on my toes the entire time.
What did you like best about it?
I just like the world development. The world was its own character.
What did you think of Tom Hardy?
He did a great job, but he wasn't required to talk much, so it was easy for him to get lost.
Did you like the chase scene?
Yes, it was very well shot. I found myself hoping that the other group would die.
Do you think that will be our future one day?
I hope not. I don't think I could survive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what my favorite thriller is?
No. What?
The Shining.
That was a good one.
Jack Nicholson is so intense!
Did you know they redid that show.
Sacrilege!
I know! Worse yet, it was a mini-series.
Stephen King sure like to do those.
Yeah. Hard to believe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite horror movie?
Have you ever seen the movie "In Dreams"?
No I don't think so. Is it new?
No, it came out years and years ago.
Who was in it? Anyone well known?
Yeah, Robert Downey Junior and Annette Bening.
Oh no way! Do you remember what year that movie came out?
I want to say late 90's?
I am going to have to check it out.
Yeah, definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie called "The Box"?
No! I have not seen it, but I heard it is really good.
Well, have you seen the movie that came out a few years ago called "Mama"?
Yes, is that the movie about a ghost that protects her two daughter who live with a new family?
Yes, that picture was great.
I saw the new movie  remake of" Poltergeist"?
I saw that, the movie is old it came about a year ago.
The original Poltergeist movie is the best.
I just saw the movie "Sinister", it was really scary, did you see it?
Yea, I saw that movie it was okay, part two just came out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer older or newer thriller films?
I love the older ones.
Oh yeah, what's your favorite.
Psycho of course. It's a classic.
I totally get that; it's so well done.
Yeah, and who doesn't like Hitchcock films?
Exactly. Did you ever notice that there is no music at the beginning of Psycho's shower scene?
No, you're kidding!
I'm not! It's totally quiet and then once the killing starts, the music starts.
Oh wow, now I have to rewatch the film so I can catch that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the mazerunner movies
Yes, i love them
Me too
They are really good
Yes they are
Im glad they finslly figured out how to get out of the maze
Me too
But they came out to a messed up world
True they might have well stayed in the glade
True
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
The Bourne Identity
That entire series is great!
I agree!  Some of Matt Daemons Finest!
Do you think the movies get better or worse as the series progresses?
That's a hard one.  I'll have to say though that they only vary a little bit in how good they are
That's kinda my thoughts as well
Yea, I mean he does such a bang up job in each film
And the story doesn't get too boring or some reason
Yea, good writing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the new movie Split.
I thought it was thrilling.
Did you enjoy the plot?
I thought it was a bit played out already. Been there and done that.
I thought it was fresh.
The acting was good, the James Mcavoy played all the personalities well.
There was a lot of cliff hangers.
But it was predictable.
I still enjoyed the movie.
I think it had a too short ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bro, do you know any good thrillers?
Thrillers? Of course, I'm a fan of thrillers.
Can you recommend one for me?
Well, have you seen the SIlence of the Lambs?
Yes, I have.
How bout Panic Room?
Panic Room, no. Sounds interesting though.
It's terrific.
Thanks for the rec.
No problem, bro.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw  that scary movie called,"Summer Camp" about these people turning into werewolf, have you seen it?
No, Was it really scary?
Yes, it saw a really scary movie, would you like to go see it with me?
Yes! I also would like to see the movie Called" The Woods".
I already saw that movie it was not so great.
Did you see that movie called "Emilie", it is about this crazy babysitter?
No! I have not seen it, but I heard the movie was good.
Have you seen the movie called"Lights Out" very scary movie?
Yes, I saw it that was a good.
There are a lot of great thrillers coming out this summer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Stephen King movie Misery?
Only about a million times. I love Kathy Bates in everything she does.
She played an insane woman really well in that movie.
That's right. It wasn't overdone or ridiculous, but very believable.
That's right. Did you see her in Dolores Claiborne?
Yes that one was just as good in my opinion. She's such a good actress.
I think I might have done the same thing she did in that situation.
You mean her character in Misery?
No of course not! I mean Dolores Claiborne, for what her husband did to their daughter.
Oh of course. I'm sure a lot of mothers sympathized with her when that came out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch 'The Visit' yet like I told you to?
Yes, I watched it last weekend with a friend.
Was it as good as I said it would be?
I actually loved it, and I appreciate you recommending it.
I hadn't seen an M. Night Shyamalan that I liked in years.
Yes, he seems to be up and down with his movies.
I either love his stuff or I hate it, and there's no middle ground.
It's funny because I agree completely.
Did you get fooled by the grandparents in the movie?
Well I knew something strange was going on, but I couldn't put my finger on what.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Thriller movie of all time?
That is a very tough question.  I would have to go with Jaws.
That is a good choice.  I hadn't thought of that one.
What about you?
I would say Sixth Sense. The twist at the end just shocked me.
I wasn't a fan.  I saw it coming.
Really?  I had no idea.
Yeah, it was kind of obvious to me.  But it is still a decent movie.
Decent?  Best thriller ever!
If you say so.  Agree to disagree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have I mentioned that 'The Prestige' is my favorite movie?
No, I never knew that you loved that film so much.
Well I've seen it over twenty times.
What makes you love it so much?
It's got tons of great actors in it, and the mood and tone of the movie is so eery.
It does kind of have a spooky atmosphere.
I love most Christopher Nolan films for that reason, and the music is haunting too.
Now you're making me want to watch it again.
I'm probably going to have to watch it again tonight when I get home.
Well I'll most likely wait longer than that, but I definitely want to view it again to see if I missed anything the first time around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love movies don't i honey you seem to love them too so did you ever see that movie I spit on your grave?
Yes it was so serious I enjoyed the movie but i did not like the parts when those men took that woman to their country and set her up.
Yeah they set her up inside her apartment all because she wouldn't expose herself by taking nude photos.
They then drugged the poor woman and brutally beat her then took her off to their country and held her hostage.
It was awful how they killed her friend and then when they got her to their country they were injuring her more and more.
The sad part was all the rapes and beatings she took and how that awful woman and those friends of theirs they were all in on this crime.
So she tried to escape many times but ended up right back there because they were all up to know good holding her hostage.
They planned on killing her but then she finally gets away and she goes out to take revenge.
Oh yeah she got them all back one by one and they got to see how it felt to be abused raped and beaten like this she made them all feel the pain she felt.
And was finally able to head back for the Embassy and get out of that country it never showed her arrive back home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any Hitchcock thriller movies?
You mean like Rear Window.
Yes that is the one I was thinking of.
Yes I love them I think I've seen a few.
Oh what other ones have you seen?
Psycho of course.
Oh yes that one has such a classic shower scene.
It still freaks me out to take a shower alone after seeing that.
Yes same here and Rear Window always makes me suspecisions of my neighbors
Yes I love how they have it set up where he is stuck in his chair because he broke his leg.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you going to see the new Transformers movie?
Absolutely not, if I'm going to watch a thriller movie, it's got to be a good one.
I hear there's a new Godzilla movie coming out, how about that?
Maybe.  I don't like to waste time on bad movies. I like something like Inception.
True, that was a great film. Is it your favorite thriller?
One of them. I loved Dark Knight.  I would consider that my favorite thriller.
That was amazing. I do like when they can be funny too.
"The Usual Suspects" was like that.  What an terrific film.
You're right.  I like the twists in that. And Kevin Spacey is cool.
Let's go watch something now. I hear Hateful Eight is on Netflix.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Taken?
Yea, that's one of my favorite movies of all time.
I can't believe how good Liam Neeson was in that.
Yea, who knew he was such a tough guy.
What was your favorite scene?
I don't know, that's hard to choose. What's yours?
Mine is definitely when he gets the phone and tells his daughter that they are going to take her.
Yea that sent chills down my spine.
It's too bad the sequels weren't as good.
Yea, sequels rarely are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I would love to watch a good movie right now!
I have a really good thriller called High Crimes.
I have seen that I think, Micheal Douglas movie, right?
No this movie stars Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.
They were in another movie together as well, right?
Yes they both also played in Kiss The Girls.
Is High Crimes similar to Kiss The Girls?
Well, they are both thrillers; but the plots are very different.
I think I will give it a try then!
Great, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what movie I would like to watch again?
Finding Nemo? No dude I have no idea.
No Country for Old Men, such a cool flick.
Heck yes, there are some weird and spooky dudes in that one.
Javier Bardem......I had no idea who he was until that movie.
Anton was dirty, nasty, mean and despicable.
What about Woody Harrelson's character? He was like the weirdo on the fringe who liked to count the number of floors in buildings.
Yeah, he didn't last too long though. Anton made sure of that.
They should have made an alternate ending where Anton got what he deserved at the end.
No way man, the movie was dark all the way. It ended like it was supposed to end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Gravity
Isn't that with George Clooney?
Yea, and Sandra Bullock
What's it about
They have to fix a space station.  It's hard not to give away the plot
Oh, it's one of those movies that you just have to see and then you'll understand?
Exactly!
Yea, say no more.  I'll check it out I hate spoilers!
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! I'm really keen to see a thriller movie this week. Is anything playing that you'd recommend?
Hm, well I absolutely loved Atomic Blonde, with Charlize Theron. Have you seen that yet?
No, I haven't! Why'd you like it so much? What's it about?
Theron plays a character called Agent Lorraine Broughton, a British spy during the Cold War. The movie is set just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and Agent Broughton has to team up with a German agent to take on a threat to Western Intelligence.
Sounds really cool, though I'm not much of a history buff. Do you think I'd still enjoy it even if I don't know much about the Cold War?
Oh, definitely. I mean, it's an intelligent movie, based on the graphic novel  The Coldest City, but it's entertainment, not a documentary.
Excellent. Sounds good, and I do love Charlize Theron. Anyone else in the movie who I'd recognize?
Yes! James McAvoy is in it, playing one David Percival, and he's absolutely excellent. Do you like him?
Are you kidding? I LOVE James McAvoy. Okay, I'm sold, I'm going to get a ticket and check this out. Cold War spy thriller, here I come!
Excellent, I hope you enjoy it - let me know! Who knows, you might just wind up a bit more of a history buff, too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like Robert De Niro?
Like him,I love him.
He's done some great thriller movies.
One of my favorites is Cape Fear.
That was really good.
Nick Nolte played the attorney in it.
Right,good part.
How about the old time actors in it.
Yes,Robert Mitchum was in it.
So was Gregory Peck.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good thiller movies lately?
I just watched the Accountant.
Who is in that?
Ben Afflac. He is really good in it. Abused by his dad but trained to be an assassin.
Sounds interesting. I like him, he's a good actor.
He also has autism and does math like the Rainman.
Smart and a bad ass. I have to wait for it to be on HBO again.
What's up with him and Jen Gardner?
I don't know but I heard he was doing the nanny.
Go figure! He should just be single and not make anymore kids.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love thriller films
Yes, me too
They are so good. Especially the ones from the 50's and 60's
Yeah. I remember The Third Man with Orson Welles.
That was a great one
Did you see The Lady From Shanghai?
Yes. I loved that one
The acting is so good
I agree
Orson Welles acts great in thrillers
XXXXXXXXXXX
You remember that thriller about a guy being chased by a crazed trucker?
You mean the original one with Dennis Weaver in it?
Yeah, what was the name of it? I want to recommend it to a friend.
It's called Duel.
Of course. How could I forget that?
That movie's a classic. I must have seen it a hundred times.
Me too. I like how they kept the truck driver's identity a secret the entire movie.
I think he was in the diner though. He had to be, just not one of the guys at the bar.
That guy had a bad case of road rage, didn't he?
Spielberg defined the meaning of road rage in that flick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched The Purge?
Yea of course! That movie is crazy.
Yea, could you imagine something like that?
Not really, I don't even think the movie makes any sense.
Yea but it's still a cool thriller.
Yea, just because it's so creative.
Definitely, there was no other movie like that.
No, the purge is one of a kind.
If there were a real purge, I don't even know what I would do.
I would hide underground.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of that movie from the 90's where the nanny terrorizes the house?
The Hand That Rocks The Cradle?
Yes, that's the one! It was on television last night.
That was a pretty solid movie. I usually watch it if it happens to be on television as well.
Rebecca DeMornay was so evil in the film!
She really was. She did a good job of controlling her rage and facial expressions, but you still could feel her seething underneath it all.
The ending, when Annabella Sciorra and Rebecca DeMornay are fighting in the attic was incredible!
It seemed to go on forever! I remember the first time I watched the movie, the anxiety was killing me.
Me too, that was intense!
I almost think it went on just a tad too long!
XXXXXXXXXXX
There was a movie I saw called "Squirm", it was about all these worms hurting people.
Was it scary to watch all those worms?
Yes, I had the chills watching all those worm crawl on people.
I saw a movie called "Ants" it was about these giant ants that were hurting people in a small town.
Do you like thriller movie about animals?
Yes, I saw a good movie called"Anaconda" about a large snake eating people.
I saw a movie called " Cujo" about this dog who has rabbies and a woman and son trapped in their car because of the dog.
There was this great 1954 movie called"Them" about spiders.
Did you see this movie called"Monkey Shine" is about a crazed monkey hurting people, that was a cool movie too.
No! but I have seen some good animal thriller movies that are as good as the zombie and vampire movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Novocaine more thrilling or more comedic?
I think it does both good.
Steve Martin is great in it.
Helena Bonham Carter is good too.
I agree.
The story is great.
Yeah. I had no idea his wife was gonna be the bad guy.
Same here.
There were so many good scenes in that film
There were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you enjoy thriller films?
Yeah I think so.
Do you have a favorite one  from the genre?
I'd have to think.
Go ahead.
I would say The Lovely Bones.  Did you see that?
I did, I really liked it.
Yeah it is a great film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you have a favorite genre in movies?
I love watching a good thriller.
Me to, have you ever seen Trespass?
I think so, who does it have in it?
It stars Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman.
I have not seen that actually. What is it about?
Cage and Kidman play a rich couple that get harassed by a group of thugs.
That sounds like it could be interesting.
You will have to watch it sometime and let me know what you think.
I will do that for sure. Thanks for suggesting it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is favorite thriller?
I would say seven.
brad pitt was at his peak in the role. At least to me  his peak in looks.
I think around that time he had some great roles, seven, fight club, legends of the fall, sleepers.
He certainly had a great ride during those years. Morgan freeman was great as well.
I liked freeman in this role especially, I found him super believable.
Yes, he is a strong talent in general. Gwenyth paltrow was a little forgettable,like almost could have been any actress.
Maybe, I mean I find her very capable in this role, but maybe the role itself was not as meaty as brad or morgan's.
I think you have apoint thee, so much of a performance is based in the script or role itself.
Can't make meatloaf with no meat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Shudder Island.
With  Leonardo DiCaprio?
Yeah.
I didn't care much for it.
Neither did I, but Leo was great.
He's always great!
True. Hard to belive he only has one Oscar.
Did you finally get one?
Yup. For The Revenant.
It's about time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you familiar with the film The Losers.
A little, I know it based on a comic series, but not much more than that.
Well, the Losers are a CIA Black Ops team.
Okay, the name is explained, but what about the plot?
The Losers are sent on a search and destroy mission to eliminate a Bolivian drug kingpin, but things go wrong.
How so?
It turns out the kingpin uses child labor and that puts kids at ground zero for the airstrike they just called in.
So I take it they try to help save the kids.
Yes, but that ends with them disavowed and legally dead, while their sinister superior, called Max, works a bloody plot to make the US number one no matter how many innocent people have to die.
Okay, sounds like a interesting fillm, I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need some non stop thriller movies
You want me to put some on right now
YES do so
What one
Put on some final destination it is my favorite
Well that is a good one
I like how it is just non specific
Yeah it is like them most popular thriller ever
I like how in the one movie the drain sucks the one guy up in the swimming pool
Ouch that had to hurt
XXXXXXXXXXX
What parts were the scariest?
The scariest for me was when the mother made the boyfriend sink into the floor and he couldn't speak or move!
Didn't the place she sent him to have a specific name?
Yes, but I can't remember it.
Ah.  What was the creepiest part of the movie for you?
When I learned that the guy running around the grounds military style was actually the girls grandfather.
The funniest?
When the boyfriend was saved at the end by his TSA friend.
Would you reccommend this movie?
Yes, if you like a good mix of all genres in one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what movie is a good thriller
What movie
The one that starred ashton kutcher
He is a good actor
I think it was called the butterfly effect
Oh yeah that is a tense movie
I love it one of my favorites
It is his best movie role
Yeah he turned from goof to good actor
Pretty accurate
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the old Hitchcock film Vertigo?
I know I did but I don't remember it that well.
I love Hitchcock. Did you see The Birds?
I sure did and was terrified of birds for weeks after that.
I know, a lot of people were. He's such a great director.
My favorite movie by him is Psycho. That's a classic.
That's hands down his best movie. No one saw the twist at the end coming.
Norman Bates is definitely a crazy character to be reckoned with.
All the Psycho sequels that came after that were no good.
Right I think they should have left it alone as it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the thriller Seven?
Yes,love Morgan Freeman.
He's one of my favorites too.
That's an older movie.
Released in 1995.
Wow,didn't realize it was that old.
Who else was in that?
Brad Pitt,Kevin Spacey.
Wasn't Gwyneth Paltrow in it too?
Oh right,she was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any scary movies you are excited to see?
I'm waiting for that reboot of IT
Oh, the scary clown movie? Are they making a new one
Yeah, and apparently it is more closer to the original thriller novel than the movie was
Wow, I wonder if it will be as scary as the original
Honestly, I dont find the original to be very scary. It was way too cheesy
Are you kidding me? Tim Curry's make up had me scared to sleep for weeks!
Honestly, it was all too outdated for my taste
I wonder how good the new one will be
I've seen the trailer, and it was already getting me freaked out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen 'Memento'?
Is that the one with Guy Pearce?
Yep, that's it. Directed by Christopher Nolan who did some Batman movies.
No I haven't - is it good?
It's amazing. Such a complex storyline but told really well.
Guy Pearce is a great actor, too.
Yeah, he really kills it. Nolan's movies are all great.
I don't think I've ever seen one of his I didn't like.
'Memento' is a little older, but it stands up to time. There's no other movie like it.
I love movies with lots of plot twists and unexpected endings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I finally saw Psycho the other day.
Took you long enough!  What'd you think?
Really creepy.  Norman Bates was a great character.
Hitchcock was a true genius.
I personally think the shower scene was a game-changer.
Not just that it's iconic, but how the main character dies midway through.
It's a very interesting choice and something you don't see coming.
Or dressing up in women's clothes for that matter.
Like I said, Norman was a total creep.
But one of film history's best characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Get Out as good as people say?
Yes, it is a really good thriller.
Did the guy from Key and Peele direct it?
Yes, Jordan Peele.
What is it about?
A guy meets his girlfriend's family and finds out some dark secrets.
When did it come out?
It came out this year.
Is Jordan Peele in it?
No, he just directed it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is one of your all time thrillers?
The silence of the lambs is one of many
Name 3 of your top choice?
Psycho, Get out, and The Circle
Do you like thrillers more than horror?
I like them both but thrillers are more mind boggling to me
Do you have nightmares after watching these types of movies?
Sometimes i di, and sometimes i just think about them a lot
How old were you when you saw your first thriller and what was it?
I was like 6 or 7 and it was a movie called Magic about a killer dummy puppet, it was pretty scary
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch The Gift?
No, how was it?
It was amazing. Jason Baitman was briliant
Was it a comedy?
No, it was a thriller.
Was Jason Baitman like a comic relief character?
No, he actually was very dislikable in this film.
That is nothing like any of his other movies.
No, he is usually very likable.
Sounds like it is something I need to check out soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Split?
Yes I have and it was a great thriller. Really disturbed me.
The Beast was of course the scariest character and he scared me to death.
I know. I was so sad when he killed the poor doctor that had been helping him.
That was really hard to watch. James McAvoy did such a great job in that movie.
I had no idea he had such a wide acting range.
Me neither. I'm so used to seeing him as Professor X so that's the demeanor I'm used to.
I didn't know Split was a Shyamalan movie until after I saw it.
I'm sure it all made sense when you found that out.
It definitely did. Had his classic twist at the end and everything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Thriller movies at all?
Yeah I love the Harry Potter movies.
Which is your favorite?
I love The Goblet of Fire.
Me too!
I also like Half Blood Prince.
That was probably my favorite one actually.
Oh that is cool.
Well it was nice talking to you.
Same to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Thriller movies at all?
Yes.
Which ones?
I like Jurassic Park.
With Same Neill?
Yeah.
I like the first one a lot too.
Did you see the new one?
Not yet.
Me neither, I have no desire to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, okay, I'm back. Night at the Opera was... interesting, so I guess I'll ask you about Hitchcock.
There are four supposed go-to classics here: Vertigo, North by Northwest, Rear Window, and Psycho. All are good, but go with Psycho.
Okay, yeah, sure. That makes sense... but, let me brace myself here... why?
It changed the way that movies are made. Before Psycho, movies were made with the assumption that people would wander in and out of the theater, so they had to be able to pick it up at any point and follow it.
Seriously? I... guess that would explain a few things, though.
Yeah, totally. So Psycho had a whole publicity campaign where they wouldn't let people in after the movie started, in case they got confused by the story structure.
So, it's a weird structure?
By today's standards, maybe not so much. But, for 1960 it was a total shocker.
Is this some Inception stuff?
No. It's just... don't get too attached to anyone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of A Nightmare On Elm Street.
Oh god that was gross.
It was one scary movie.
Still scares me today.
Wes Craven does crazy stuff.
Does he ever.
How about a young Johnny Depp in it.
Wow,that was 1984 I think.
Yes it was.
What a classic movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the original Jurassic Park?
I did when it first came out.
You need to watch it again.
Why do you say that?
It is truly thrilling.
I remember it being good.
It is filled with amazing thrills and chills.
Ok that sounds like a fun movie to watch.
Yes you will enjoy it.
Ok
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how was that western thriller starring Clint Eastwood's son? Have you seen it yet?
I have actually. It wasn't as good as I expected.
That's what I've been hearing. What's the problem, though?
The story is a bit confusing and just plain under-developed,
Well, was Scott Eastwood as good as his father then?
He's a decent actor. I don't know if he's as good as Clint.
I guess I'll wait to watch in when it comes on cable.
That's a good idea.
I was looking forward to seeing a decent western.
Go re-watch Unforgiven.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is No Country For Old Men a good movie?
Depends on who you ask.
You've seen it haven't you? Did you like it? I've never seen it before.
I thought it started off strong, but fell apart close to the end.
How so?
Let's just say, the main guy makes a bad decision that totally ruins the flow of the story in my opinion.
The guy who finds the money or the bad guy that Javier Bardem plays?
The guy who finds the money.
I might check it out anyway. How's Tommy Lee Jones' performance?
Forgettable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally watched 'The Sixth Sense' last week.
Wow, you were really late to the party on that one.
It's funny that I just never got around to watching it before.
So what did you think of it?
Surprisingly, I didn't figure out the ending, and no one has ever spoiled it for me.
Oh that's great, because if you know beforehand, the whole film would have been ruined for you.
Yes, I can't believe I didn't see the ending coming.
When I saw it when it first came out, I didn't figure it out either.
I guess that's why they call it a twist.
It's so much fun when it happens and you don't see it coming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the movie "Signs"?
I actually didn't think it was bad. Not the best I've ever seen, though.
I always thought it was really slow to start.
Yeah, but the plot does get pretty interesting after while.
I thought the concept of the aliens and the crop circles were scary.
I agree. The movie made me want to lock my doors when it picked up.
M. Night Shyamalan always has pretty interesting ideas.
He does. I thought the baby monitor scene was a great choice.
That part freaked me out.
Me too. That, and the fact that crop circles are a real life occurrence.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm like 25 years late, but finally saw Silence of the Lambs.
Jodie Foster's best movie in my opinion.
Hannibal was truly one of the best villains ever.
The weird thing is he's kind of anti-villain in some weird fashion.
Nah.  He murdered the prison guards and was crazy.
But Hopkins performance was second to none.  He made that character.
It creeped me out as I really thought he was a serial killer.
His voice just gives me shivers.
I'll never drink another Fresca again after watching it.
Yeah, no kidding.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the movie"The Boy" it was a good movie.
Is that about that doll that comes to life?
Yes, the movie was really scary.
I want to go and see the movie called "The Darkness" it looks like a really scary movie, do you want to go see it?
Yes, I will go with you, is that the movie about the little boy who found this rock in a cave?
Yes it is, the movie comes out today.
The Movie" Purge 3" is coming to theaters too, have you seen "The Purge"part 3?
Yes, it is a scary picture.
The "Purge" part 2 was good too.
I saw all the "Purge movies they were all really scary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched any good thrillers lately?
Yes, yesterday I watched The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.
I have heard of that one, is it any good?
Yes it is awesome! It keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The main characters are played by Rebecca Dr Mornay and Annabella Sciorra.
I think I am going to watch that one tonight.
You really should, it really is a thriller.
Are there any plot points that I Should be aware of?
Just do not look away for a moment!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best thriller movie you've seen in the past few years?
Probably Gone Girl.
Ah! That's a good one.
Yea like everything about that movie was so unexpected.
Yea, like when they did the second half of the movie from the wife's point of view.
I know right?! Like they set up it so that you're convinced that the husband had something to do with the wife's disappearance, like you're so sure of it.
Yea, then they show just how psycho the wife was and how she set the whole thing up.
Such a good twist.
I totally did not see that coming at all.
And the ending was crazy. I feel so bad for the husband.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller?
Has to be Silence of the Lambs.
That was so freaky!
Anthony Hopkins is a genious!
True. But what about the main bad guy?
He was pretty creepy.
Did you ever see the show Monk?
With Tony Shalhoub?
Yep.
His captain was the killer in Silence.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the Boondock Saints?
No but I have heard of it.
It is popular for a reason.
Did you like it?
Yes I loved it.
What is it about.
I wouldn't want to spoil it but it is deep and thrilling movie.
Ok I like movies that are both deep and thrilling.
You will enjoy it.
Ok I will watch it, thanks for mentioning it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats been the best thriller movie you ever saw?
Mystic River was the best.
Would you call that a thriller.
Yeah the hunt for the murderer was epic.
What would you say was the best scene.
Where Sean Penn is about to kill Tim Robbins.
Thats nuts that you would think that.
Its an amazing story.
Is it based on fact?
That I do not think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to watch this great Thriller movie with me from 1992 called the Crying Game it's a weird movie i think i seen it already but it was so good.
Yeah i don't have anything else to do why not I love interesting movies the name does sound kind of cool and crazy.
Yeah crazy it was the kind of movie that made me feel kind of freaked out until i understood what was going on.
You mean to tell me it was that weird and off the hook what made it weird? I guess i will see.
Well there's this Irish Republican Army member Stephen Rea i believe he plays as the man who gets involved in a affair thinking it is a man when it turns out to be a woman.
How does this take place? I cannot understand how two men ended up together.
An unexpected bond with Jody Forest Whitaker a kid napped British Soldier Jody makes Fergus promise he'll visit his girlfriend and when Fergus flees to the city he seeks her out.
wow what a movie but how did the man end up seeing another man romantic wise. I guess i will have to keep watching.
Well during the movie he meets the woman inside a bar but don't know it's a man he continues seeing the man and one day the man decides to tell his lover the truth.So the lover finds out he is devastated and everything crazy people start to fight and murder each other it gets unimaginable and ugly. The lover takes the blame and goes to jail for a long time.
It was a really crazy movie it was very awful and confusing to me but anyway thanks for taking the time out to explain to me about the crazy movie thriller we just watched.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a Nicole Kidman movie the other day with a really cool twist ending.
Hmmmm, not sure what movie you are talking about.
It's called The Others.
Oh, I gotcha.  Yeah, I remember that film.
The ending was very creative, didn't you think?
How they didn't realize they were dead the whole time?
Right.  Didn't feel tacked on or out of place.
Which is nice to see.  Way too many twist endings have a twist just for the sake of it.
This one made complete sense and fit in with the scope of the film.
Completely agree.  Was very well done by the filmmaker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still think one of the top all time thriller movies was Psycho!
I have to agree with you.
That Alfred Hitchcock did some creepy stuff.
He was the best.
Anthony Perkins was great!
So was Janet Leigh.
Yes she was.
When was that released?
It was released in 1960.
Wow,that long ago?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Life?
I was expecting a bit more honestly.
It was okay.  I thought the ending was creative.
You mean how the alien actually lands on Earth?
In water, right.  The pods were in fact going the opposite way in space.
Kind of a downer, but I guess that was the point.
I kind of saw it coming though.
Really? Not me.
This just seems like the type of movie where you should expect a twist and lo and behold, there is one.
I was thinking they would all die instead, but get what you mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Silence of the Lambs?
That's one of the most terrifying movies ever.
Anthony Hopkins was born to play that role.
Right he had the right blend of psychopathy and civility needed for that role.
Jodie Foster didn't do too bad of a job either.
That's right she didn't. She was pretty good in Panic Room also.
That's the one where she had a daughter right?
Yes and they had a special room they were able to hide from robbers in.
I definitely need a room like that, just to hide away from my kids.
You and me both. But without all the thrills and suspense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a good thriller movie to watch?
I think you can't ever go wrong with The Shining.
I've never seen it.
Oh you need to watch it. Its got everything, action, drama, suspense. Jack Nicholson is incredible!
That's the one that takes place in the hotel, right?
Yes, its a big, creepy, old hotel.
Is it very bloody? I'm not into blood.
Only one scene is really bloody, but no one is bleeding.
What does that mean?
I guess you'll have to watch and see!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Identity with John Cusack?
Oh my goodness that was a wonderful movie. I never saw the twist coming.
I don't think anyone did. They did such a great job of separating the characters.
I love movies where the main character has a split personality and thinks he's interacting with separate others.
Me too. John Cusack did a great job in 1408 also.
Oh that's the movie based on the Stephen King book right?
Yes it is. I have to say he did a really wonderful job of displaying fear in that movie.
That's one I haven't seen yet but I need to check it out.
It'll have you on the edge of your seat, trust me.
Yeah I believe you but Identity is one of my favorite suspense thrillers for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that thriller movie "Ghost in the Shell" with Scarlett Johansson?
Yeah, I saw it last month. I was surprised that I liked it.
Why, what did you expect going in?
Oh, I thought it might just be mindless action, something short on plot and just loud.
So, did it have a good plot? Isn't it a remake of a Japanese movie?
It's based on a Japanese manga, a comic of the same name. And the plot gave me something to think about later.
Oh, I like that kind of plot. Makes me want to see the movie again.
I would see it again so that I can pay more attention to the detailed sets and the little things now that I know what's going to happen.
Were there any other big name stars? Names I might recognize?
You'd recognize the French actress Juliette Binoche. We saw her play Bryan Cranston's wife in the Godzilla movie that came out in 2014.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like 1980 thriller movies?
Yes, movies like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm street.
I watch all the "Friday the 13th movie, they are great

It was a very cool film.  I actually thought it was the best movie last year.
The alien language part was well done and a slow burn.
It was always building to something which I appreciated.
Especially the end.  Who would have thought that it was a different character for the divorce?
It was a great exercise in movie making.
It was nice to see a twist ending that didn't feel cheap.
Credit the screenwriter for that.
Hopefully they make more enjoyable movies like that where the ending is in doubt.
Hopefully, but who knows with Hollywood.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched that new movie 'The Belko Experiment'?
No I haven't; is it good?

Yes that was a certainly a thriller even for an older movie!
What did you think of the shower scene?
It was scary! Janet Leigh always said she wasn't able to take a shower after filming that scene.
Anthony Perkins played his part really good.
You're right. He seemed such a gentle person to turn out to be the killer.
It was kind of gruesome that he had his mother
He certainly wanted to keep his Mother around.
The hotel was really creepy.
Yes, it would make you think twice about staying in an older hotel out away from everything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you watch a lot of thriller movies?
I've seen a few yeah.
Where did you watch the last one?
I saw seven on tv the other day.
Oh that is a great film.
Yeah it is fantastic.
I haven't seen it in a very long time.
You should watch it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first thriller movie you ever saw?
Does Beetlejuice count?
I guess. I mean really thriller thriller though.
Hm. Probably Nightmare on Elm Street.
Me too. Or Friday the thirteenth.
Yeah. Lot's of 80's slashers. Halloween was the scariest.
Oh that mask and the slow pace and the music!
I really like all the new clever horror movies though.
YEah cabin in the woods is fantastic
For sure. I love that film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite old Thriller movie?
I would say it's "the Birds" by Hitcock.
That's a GREAT one!  Hitchock was really the king of thrillers, don't you think?
Totally agree.  Do you like any of the more recent thrillers?
I loved Shutter Island with DiCaprio
That's one of my favorites. I can't believe the ending, can you?
I think that one bothered me for days.  DAYS.
I don't think there are as many thriller movies as there used to be, do you?
I guess the thriller movie genre is not always as easily defined as some of the other types
I think that the film companies don't know how to market them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched The Strangers again last night. Couldn't fall asleep for two hours afterward.
Again? I thought that movie terrifies you.
It does, but I love it. I love the whole genre.
I haven't watched The Strangers yet. Should I?
It's one of the most terrifying movies, in my opinion.
Really? What makes it so scary?
Because of how realistic it is. I don't have to worry about supernatural forces killing me, but I should worry about home invasions.
That's a good point. Any other similar movies I should check out?
Funny Games is similar.
I have seen that one. Makes you want to not be nice to strangers who show up at your door.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies?
I guess so.  Aren't they kind of suspenseful?
Yes I think thriller and suspense are synonymous.
I like Alfred Hitchcock.
He was the thriller master.
My favorite Hitchcock thriller is Psycho.
I like the Birds.
That is good too.  It made me hate birds for awhile.
Another good old thriller os Murder on the Orient Express.
I will have to check that out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last movie you saw?
I saw Lego Batman.
Was it any good?
Yeah it was really good.
I loved the Lego movie.
If you liked that, you will love Lego Batman.
Does it have the same humor?
Yeah, it's still goofy but has heart.
Why can Lego make such good movies?
I think it's because they actually care and it's not just a cash grab.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Psycho?
Yes.
Is it as thrilling as everyone says?
Yes and no. It's older, so while there are some jump scares, it's not horror.
So it's psychological?
Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff in that movie never shown before on screen.
Like what?
Cross-dressing, a dead mother, and even a toilet flushing!
Those are nothing.
True, but this came out in 1960.
XXXXXXXXXXX
As a fan of thriller, did you like the Child's Play franchise growing up?
Somewhat, yes. I used to really get a kick out of Chucky.
Do you think the direction they went was the right one? With the films becoming more dark comedies?
Yes and no. As time went on, I don’t think seeing a killer doll was all that scary to the masses anymore.
I understand your point. However, I think it still could have worked if they tried. It almost felt like after the third film, it literally became a comedy.
I do not disagree. I think they just felt it would’ve made the movies more amusing.
I can see your point. That being said, the most recent movie was a bit more on the serious side.
I noticed that while I was watching. I think they should go for a good blend of the thriller with some comedy.
There is a new Child’s Play sequel coming out this year, also.
Really? I did not know that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Phone Booth?
Yes. It was so suspenseful.
I was wondering the whole time who the killer was.
I had no idea how it was going to end.
Yes. Every scene has you sat the edge of your seat.
What is another thriller you like?
Any Hitchcock movie really.
Like what?
The Birds and Psycho are both great thrillers.
I will have to see those.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Departed?
Isn't that a Gangster movie?
Yes, it has an all start cast!
Yes, I have seen it. It has been a few years though.
What do you remember about it?
I just remember Leonardo and Matt Damon giving amazing perfomrances.
Yes, they acted their hearts out.
I was amazed when i first watched it how well the plot and character development was.
You don't see that too much in the gangster movie genre.
I think it is better than Godfather 1.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! I'm in the mood to see a good thriller movie tonight, any recommendations?
Oh! Definitely check out Alien: Covenant - it's excellent, really well done, and seriously scary.
Really? I'm not a huge fan of the Alien franchise, though I'm open to reconsider. What did you like so much about this one?
Well, for one thing, it's got Billy Crudup in it, playing Christopher Oram, the first mate of the Covenant. He's really good - the movie's worth seeing for him alone if you like Billy Crudup.
I do like Billy Crudup. Okay, I'm interested. Any other good cast members?
Well, I'm not a huge fan, but Michael Fassbender is really good in the movie, playing David 8 and Walter, these android characters. He's really good, and it's interesting fare!
Oh, I do love Michael Fassbender. He's such an interesting actor.
He is in this, certainly. Also, the movie's got Katherine Waterston as "Danny," an expert in terraforming. The character is really smart, I think she ups the quality of the movie in general.
Hm, I've never heard of her, but this sounds like a movie that could probably keep my interest. I do like science fiction thrillers in general, so I'm going to give this a try.
Hooray! I hope you enjoy it. Who knows, maybe you will turn out to be an Alien fan after all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what would you like to do tonight?
How about we stay in and watch the movie Seven.
What kind of movie is that?
It is a thriller staring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.
Have you seen it before?
Yes, but I want you to watch it with me!
What is it about?
Let's just say that the ending will stun you!
Are there any more famous actors in in?
Yes, Kevin Spacey plays a role that you have never seen him in before.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you "It Comes At Night"?
No! When did it come out?
It came out just last week. It was released on June 9th.
What is it about?
It's about the end of the world and a family seeking refuge.
Is it bloody and gruesome?
Not as much as some movies, but a little bit.
What did you think of it?
I loved it! Joel Edgerton was amazing.
Neat! I might have to see it soon in that case
XXXXXXXXXXX
Reservoir Dogs, how did I just find out about this gem?
It's been out for such a long time!
I know, I saw it with a friend recently and the story telling was done so well.
Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink was my favorite character
The whole aspect of the heist and crime elements were so powerful.
I liked how they started to turn on each other
It's easy to see how they would, with that much stress going on
I don't think I would be able to do a heist
It's a lot of planning and teamwork to pull off, and the danger is not worth it for me.
I liked how the ending was a little ambiguous
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite particular series of thriller movies or one that you truly enjoy watching?
This may not be the answer you were expecting, but I’ve always loved the Scream franchise.
I can believe that. I grew up watching those movies and always enjoyed them as well.
Do you have a favorite movie of the four of them?
While Scream 2 was a good one, I don’t think you can top the original.
I absolutely agree. That first movie had a little bit everything.
Looking back on it years later, do you think there was a good blend of horror and dark comedy?
Definitely. When we were younger, we missed most of it, but now that we are older, it’s great.
To be honest, I do not know many who are not fans of the Scream series.
No surprise there. They aren’t the best ever, but that does not make them any less entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any new thriller movies that are good?
I thought Split was pretty good.
Is that the one with James McAvoy?
Yeah, he has over 20 split personalities in that movie.
I remember seeing the trailer for that. So it's good?
Yeah, he actual does very well at making the personalities believable.
I guess that would be a really hard role to take on.
I'm sure it was. That's like accepting over 20 roles.
Was it scary enough to make you jump, or was it just creepy?
I thought it was a really good balance of scary and interesting. There were definitely some "jump" moments.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think western movies are cool
Yeah they can be pretty thrilling
I like no country for old men
That is not really a western sort of
I know but it is pretty good
Well i cannot argue
I think i might watch it now that we are talking about it
Why dont we both watch it
That would be cool
Yeah it would
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you recommend The Prestige or The Illusionist for a thriller?
The Prestige.
So they're both about magic.
Right.
Why do you prefer this one?
It has a surprise twist you most likely won't see coming.
Oooh, nice. Like an M. Night twist?
Yeah, it's pretty devastating and shows a ton of commitment.
Nice! Sounds good.
Yeah, The Illusionist isn't bad either, but not really a thriller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies?
oh yeah, watching a thriller always make me feel refreshing after a day's mundane work
ok, the movie I'm referring to is The Ring
I heard there are multiple iterations of them, which one should I watch?
oh, definitely the one with Naomi Watts in it, she's such a brilliant actor
oh Naomi Watts, I've seen her movies, she's really great. Looks like I have to watch the movie
haha, I hope you don't get panic with phone or TV after watching the movie
yeah, why is that, doesn't make any sense?
well you'll know once you finish watching the movie
now I can't wait
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch kissing by sharon sala
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the  basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Some thrillers, while not necessarily great, can also just go down as being fun. Case in point, From Dusk Till Dawn.
I do not think I have seen that movie. Could you fill me in the plot details?
Pretty basic plot of two criminals on the run who kidnap a father and his young children to help them escape to Mexico. On the way there, they stop at a bar and wind up trapped with vampires.
Sounds amusing. Is it quite over-the-top in terms of violence?
It is violent film, yes. That being said, I think it is so over-the-top it can actually be overlooked.
Isn't that a Quentin Tarantino movie?
Yes! So you already may have an idea of what to do expect.
I really like his movies and may consider giving From Dusk Till Dawn a watch.
I think you'll find it entertaining. While it is a thriller, there are also a fair amount of laughs.
That's good. I enjoy a good dark comedy with a scary movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you have a favorite thriller movie?
Of all time?
Yeah sure.
Well it would have to be Pulp Fiction.
That is a great choice.
I love it.
That is definitely in my top 25 movies of all time.
I would have to agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Thriller movies at all?
Yes I like James Bond movies.
Which one?
Skyfall.
That one is good.
I also like Spectre.
My favorite is Casino Royale.
Another fantastic one!
It is hard to choose with  them.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thriller?
That would have to be Psycho!
I think the best thrillers are Hitchcock films too!
Really, what is your favorite.
The Birds, Rear Window, Vertigo. Pretty much all of them.
Did you ever see American Psycho?
No, who is in that?
Christian Bale.
Oh, he is in some other thrillers, too, right?
Yeah, I think The Machinist is one of the best known thrillers he's in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recommend any good thrillers?
A classic is Silence of The Lambs.
I've never seen it, its good?
Yes, its a really good blend of characters and story.
Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, so I will check it out.
I liked the sequels too, but the 1st is the best.
I'm excited to see how it lives up to todays standards.
Don't worry, it more than holds up.
Have you seen The Shining?
Yes, another classic thriller!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Curve?
No, what's that about?
It's a movie about a woman who gives a hitchhiker a ride and ends up driving off a cliff.
Why did she do that?
Well, he took out a knife and she started freaking out, so she figured, I'll either get raped or I'll drive off this cliff.
Oh, and she chose the cliff.
Yep, and then she gets stuck in her car for days at the bottom of the cliff.
Wow, does she die.
No, she is quite the warrior in the movie. She gets out and gets revenge.
Very cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Event Horizon?
What was it about?
There was a spaceship and they were having trouble reaching it.  So they sent out a crew.
Did they make it there?
Yeah, but when they did, no one was on the ship.
Okay, but where did they go?
That's what the movie is about.  There is evil or something on the ship.
Wow, this sounds good.  When did it come out?
Probably about fifteen years ago.
Cool, I'll have to look into that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Thriller movie of all time?
Easy, easy, easy. The Shining, it's such a classic.
Right on. Jack Nicholson is absolutely mad and it's based on a Steven King book.
I remember watching as a kid and having nightmares.
Do you remember what was in the nighmares?
Yes, those twins on the bicycles and of course REDRUM.
I watched it a little later than you I'm guessing, probably 15 or 16, so it was less scary, but my dad told me to watch out for REDRUM.
Did that make it easy for you to understand that it spelled MURDER when you reversed it?
Ha! No, not at all, he had to make that connection for me.
Yeah, I can see how one might get fixated on the RUM part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the exorcist thrillers?
I love all of them!
I think they just keep remaking them since we keep watching.
There are five sort of cannon ones as of now.
I think they are supposed to make a few new ones too.
I love how scary the girl is in the first one.
You know the set of those films are supposed to be haunted.
I think it showed well in the movie.
The actors all seemed just sort of scared.
It made the movie seven more scary to those watching it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Bourne Ultimatum thriller?
Yes, I think so, but it has been a while.
Mat Damon stars in this one , he tries to find his true identity despite people trying to kill him.
It is always enjoyable to watch Matt Damon act in the Bourne series.
Paul Greengrass directed that one.
When was it released?
2007 in December of that year.
I wonder how much money they made in the US on that movie.
I think it was about $42 million dollars
That is incredible the money they make in Hollywood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi! What kind of movies do you like?
I guess I like thriller movies best.
Hey, me too! What's your favorite?
I really like The Sixth Sense.
You mean the one with the kid who could see dead people? With Bruce Willis?
Yes, I love Bruce Willis in that movie. And it gets better every time I watch it.
M. Night Shamalan is a great director. You can watch that movie over and over and see how careful a director he is.
The Sixth Sense is his best, though. I didn't like Signs as much.
No, me neither; it's a little cheesy. Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor, though.
I think so too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Unfriended?
Is that the one about cyber bullying?
Yea that's the one!
I didn't like that one.
Oh, why not?
It just wasn't scary, and it was pretty supid.
I thought it was pretty intense.
It was just really difficult for me to watch a whole movie over skype.
Yea that part was pretty weird.
Yea, I definitely wish I could Unsee that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Julia Robert's movie, "Secret in Their Eyes?"
I actually just watched that the other week. Wow, I was totally blown away.
I know I wouldn't pick her for a thriller style movie, but man did she deliver.
I know, I'm so used to her playing such wholesome roles, like "Eat,Pray, Love" and "Stepmom" that this was a real surprise.
I really didn't think she had it in her, but she aced it.
I agree, it was like "Silence of the Lambs" meets "Misery."
Oh wow, that is the perfect description!
She doesn't have that Kathy Bates crazy in her eyes, but there was something there.
I hope she does more movies like this, it was great to see her out of her comfort zone.
I agree. Who knew Julia Roberts could be so scary?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thriller movie?
Would have to be Cape Fear
The original it the remake?
Have actually only seen the remake, but the great Robert De niro is ultra creepy in it.
I agree, he's such a great actor and that films is outright chilling.
Have you seen the original?
No I also haven't seen the original, but have been wanting to.
I would be interested in watching them back to back, you willing?
Sure let's plan on it and then we can compare, De Niro is going to be tough to best though.
Agreed, Nick Nolte also does a great job in the remake as well. The original dies have some definite talent though, Gregory Peck for example.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey' have you ever watched the movie Limitless?
No, what's it about, some sports film.
No, Bradley Cooper plays a frustrated author whose life is a mess. Then, his former borhter in law offers him a nootropic drug called NZT-48
Nootropic drug. What kind of drug is that?
They're drugs that improve the function of the brain. Who know that old adage that we only use 10% of our brains.
Yeah, so this stuff let's you use more of it?
More like all of it! One pill and you have a triple digit IQ and perfect recall of everything you've ever seen, heard, or read.
Okay, but what's the downside?
The downside is the drug isn't common and the withdrawl symptoms can cause hospitalize you or even kill you outright.
Yikes! Thanks for the info, I've the movie a look, but don't offer me any of the that drug.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a great thriller movie?
North by Northwest
Is that an old film?
Yes, quite old.
Who is in it?
Carey Grant
Oh, I love his films. Who directed it?
Alfred Hitchcock
He is a great director. What is the most thrilling scene?
When the plane tries to kill Grant's character
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
I like them a bit.
What have you seen recently?
The movie Lucy.
With Scarlett Johansson?
Yes.
How was it?
It was alright.
Would I like it?
Perhaps.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you consider the best thriller of all time?
I think it would be hard to pick one.
Ok, what do you say is the best one in the last decade?
I would have to go with Gone Girl.
Remind me, who was in that one?
It had Ben Afleck.
Right, with the wife who might not be dead?
Yes, it keeps you guessing until the final shot.
I love those action packed thrillers.
But ones that also have a lot of psychological thrill too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the prestige?
With christian bale?
Yes and Hugh Jackman.
Yes, I think it was early 2000s though.
It was 2006 that it came out. Did you enjoy it?
I was shocked at the end, but then it made so much sense.
lol. ya it was one of those reveal moments that gets you.
Christopher Nolan directed and wrote it too right?
Jonathon Nolan also wrote it with him. But he directed.
His stuff is always so strong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen I walked with a Zombie?
I have. It's a great old movie.  It is definitely a thriller.
I like the use of the voodoo music.
I like that it was based on Jane Eyre.
I really like the way there was both a natural and supernatural explanation.
I would hate to see it remade today.
Yeah, they would add so much it would go on forever.
I like the development of the wife's character even though she never speaks.
Yes, you go from being sympatheitc to her to not sympahtetic at all.
It was a very suprising end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen American Psycho?
Yea, that's one twisted movie.
No kidding. It makes you feel like anyone could be crazy.
Well, anyone can. Christian Bale was so convincing.
Yea, can't believe that's the same guy that played as batman.
Yea, but he was really good in batman too.
Yea he was, he's such a great actor.
Yea, and he does such weird movies.
Yea, I just hope he doesn't make another American Psycho, that movie scared the crap out of me.
Yea me too, it was hard to trust anybody after that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I recently watched an older thriller movie from the early '90's with Michael Keaton called Pacific Heights. Have you ever heard of it?
I don't think I have. What's the movie about?
Michael Keaton plays a very slick conman who rents out an apartment in the Pacific Heights area and is basically the worst tenant ever. He makes the landlord, who are engaged couple, lives miserable.
Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like it would be that great of a movie. How is Michael Keaton at playing the villain?
Honestly, I think the movie is okay, but definitely nothing special. As far as Keaton, he was okay.
Are there plot twists or any thing crazy go down at all?
No, not really. The whole idea is learning just how much of a con artist his character really is.
I may consider checking that movie out, because I am a big fan of Michael Keaton.
I wouldn't say Pacific Heights is great, by any means. But it's not awful, either.
I'll have to give that one a watch one of these days and decide for myself then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite movies is taken
Those movies were good
And i love liam nelson
He was born for that part
They were overall great
I agree
I would be happy if they came out with more
Me too
His daughter could get taken again
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the movie that won the Oscar about ten years back?
That's helpful.  Who was in it?
Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson...
Oh, you mean The Departed?
Yep.  That's the one I'm thinking of.
Awesome movie.  Scorsese is still the king.
I actually liked Mark Wahlberg's character the best.
Yep, he got the last laugh on Damon at the end.
Did you know it was a remake of a Japanese film?
Really?  Didn't know that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any good thriller movies?
I really liked The Gift
What's that movie about?
Its about two high school friends who reunite after 20 years but they have some scores to settle
Oh, what about it makes it a thriller?
Well one guy was nerdy and got picked on and now he is really creepy to the other guy
Oh, that's interesting.
Do you know of any good thrillers?
I like the Invitation, it's also about a creepy guy who reunited with old friends
Oh, I'll have to watch it soon!

Yes and she was able to wear some pretty sweet outfits
Yeah, I liked that yellow and black motorcycle outfit
Definitely contrasted well with all that blood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Exorcist?
Like it? I loved it.
Wasn't it based on a true story?
Yes it was.
That makes it even scarier.
I know it does.
I've read that some audience members fainted when they saw some of the special effects done on Linda Blair.
Yes,I've heard that too.
It kind of messed her up too I heard.
Yes,she even said that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Hitchcock the best thriller director?
I think so
He has so many great thriller
Can you name a couple?
Yes. North By Northwest and The Birds

I agree
He is really good at thrillers
Don't forget Rear Window and Vertigo
Those are classics too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Rear Window?
Yes and I loved it.
Did you like James Stewart in it?
Yes and I also liked The Simpsons rendition of it too.
Who directed Rear Window?
Alfred Hitchcock
Oh, that figures. He makes amazing suspense movies.
Did you ever see Psycho?
Yes and loved it.
Anthony Perkins was great in that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Alien?
Yes, I loved it.
Do you think of it as a horror film?
Yes, but it is very suspenseful.
How do you figure>
Because the whole time they are looking for the alien and it creates a sense of tension.
That is true. You never know where it is.
Did you think it was directed well?
Yes, the way it was shot was so cool. I really felt like I was on board with everyone.
Ian Holm was awesome in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever seen the Usual Suspects?
Awesome movie with a classic ending.
Yeah, the whole time you thought that the cop guy was Kaiser Sosa, or he was made up.
It was so good.  You never knew what was real and what wasn't.
Yeah, and how Kevin Spacey just made all those things up on the fly.
He's such a good actor.  Everything he touches is gold.
That ending my jaw dropped when he started walking normal.
Yeah, like we all thought he was dumb but he was the mastermind the whole time.
Like he says, the Devils greatest trick was convicting the world he didn't exist.
I know, awesome movie.  Think maybe I'll watch that again this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well I went and saw Friday the 13th.
What did you think?
You told me it has Freddy Kruger in it.
It does, doesn't it?
No, Friday the 13th is Jason.
Ah, my bad, I get those confused.
Nightmare on Elm street is Freddy Kruger.
Well, what did you think of the movie anyway?
It was pretty good. Jason killed everybody.
Jason is a bad dude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
Yeah sometimes.
Have you seen any in awhile?
Yeah I saw Life.
Who is in that?
Ryan Reynolds and Jake Gyllenhaal.
Oh interesting.
Yeah I highly recommend it.
That is good I will see it sometime.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good thrillers recently?
I saw The first Purge movie
Isnt that the movie where they can do any crime for one day?
Yeah, so lots of people go out and commit crimes
Oh man, that's scary. I'd just hide in my house
Some people in the movie try that
And how does it go for them?
It works well, until their kids let in someone running for their life
Oh that's cool. I want to see it now!
Yeah, I'm going to watch the second one now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Casino Royale?
Yes I have.  Craig was an awesome Bond.
Yeah, they brought a gritty realism to it.
Yeah, and that running scene at the start was great.
Yeah, he's a very athletic Bond.
I also like how he's not head to toe in gadgets.
Me too.  Makes it a little more thrilling and less comical.
It was a good genius movie too.  Every other Bond movie Bond was already Bond.
Yeah I know, like when he ordered the Martini.
Also really good final scene.  "Names Bond, James Bond"
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you kept up with current movies
I try to sometimes
Well i want an opinion on one
What movie do you want an opinion on

Yes.
Oh I will have to watch it.
Please do, I recommend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Prisoners before?
Not sure, what is it about?
Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) faces a parent's worst nightmare when his 6-year-old daughter, Anna, and her friend go missing.
Isn't Jake Gyllenhaal in that one too?
Yes, it came out about 2013 I think.
I never got to see that one in the theater before.
Yes, it is a heart-wrenching one.
I hope it turns out good.  Don't tell me, I want to see it!
Ok I won't tell you!
Thanks!  I will rent it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see they're going to make a sequel to The Strangers?
Hm. I wonder if it will be any good.
The first one terrified me
Did you know it's sort of based on true events?
I did. They filmed it near my house so it extra freaked me out.
I don't like that they keep making sequels of movies though.
I know i wish they would just make new stuff
Have you heard of any non sequel movies?
I think there is one called God Particle
i'll have to watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I rewatched "The Usual Suspects" the other day and the more I think about this movie, the more ludicrous it seems.
If you're talking about the giant plot hole in the movie as ludicrous, then yes I very much agree.
We have Soze, who pulled all of this off because he wanted to kill/quiet a dude who could identify him and he failed because at the end of the movie a dude did identify him, and the NYPD even had a mugshot of him!
I had this exact question in my head. I'm pretty sure it's just a plot hole. An explanation could be that considering pretty much everything he tells us is a lie, maybe even his motivation for the hit job was a lie?
No that can't be it! Because Mr. Soze never states his mission for the job. It was Detective Kujan who pieced it all together.
Then why did he have to embark on this grand assassination mission in the first place?
The weird part is, they had the seeds for tying this together in Keaton's girlfriend, who is tied to the man that can identify him.
Ah, I forgot about Edie but I'm guessing that maybe Soze just pulled all of this off because he had no other choice.
Maybe Mr. Soze was actually just doing damage control the entire time?
It makes a lot of sense! Here's the breakdown: He was caught by the police, and at the start of the film you can actually hear him genuinely confess. The point is he doesn't actually have some grand plan, his only goal is to tell a story that will get him out the police station so that he can escape.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that movie with Jack Nicholson at the hotel?
I think you are referring to The Shining.
Right, the Stephen King movie.
Man, that was creepy.  Bleeding walls, twin girls.
Full of tons of cool things.  Probably one of the greatest quotes ever with 'Here's Johnny!'
Fun fact: did you know that was improvised?
Oh really?  Didn't know that.
Yep, Jack made it up on the fly after he smashed the door.
That's cool.  I never realized that and it makes me respect him a bit more.
He probably has more of a comedic touch than you would normally think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite scary movie is still Night Of The Living Dead.
Man was that scary.
I was only fourteen years old when I saw that.
It was all in black and white.
Yes it was.
George Romero directed it.
There wasn't any top actors or actresses in it either.
No there wasn't.
The Walking Dead took from this movie.
It sure did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy watching thriller movies?
Yeah, the scarier the better. I especially like movies taken from Stephen King books.
Did you see the Stephen King movie "It" that came out on television in 1990?
I think so, wasn't that the one with a clown named Pennywise?
Yes, that's the one. It's the reason I don't like clowns.
Kind of like Stephen King's Cujo. That's the reason I'm afraid of Saint Bernards.
There's a few thrillers about to be released, some might be pretty good.  I'm looking forward to The Mummy.
I saw a recently released thriller called Split. It was pretty good.
I saw Split, didn't think I'd like it, but it turned out to be really good.
I think the thriller I'm most looking forward to is 47 Meters Down. It'll be interesting to see how good of an actress Mandy Moore is in a movie like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best Clint Eastwood film?
Dirty Harry
Really?
It is his most memorable performance.
I didn't even know he was in that
. That was the movie with the quote "Do you feel lucky?"
Oh, cool
Yeah. It's a great thriller
I will have to watch it
I have it. Let's watch it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any good films lately?
Well, I saw The Girl On The Train, that wasn't too bad I guess.
Huh.. what was that about?
Well, this girl, she rides a train everyday and passes by this particular house where's she's speculating about the lives of the couple that live there, also she spies on her husband and his new life who lives next to said couple.  Eventually someone turns up missing and she gets involved and so on.
Huh.. sounds interesting.
Yeah, it's a bit confusing though, because they keep bouncing back and forth between three different characters, two of which look rather similar and the main narrator is an alcoholic so we (the audience) can't rely on what she's experiencing.
Ahh.. yeah, the Unreliable Narrator.  You see that sometimes in books and stuff.
Neat you say that, cause this movie is actually based on a book.
Really?
Yeah, I believe the original story takes place in London.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does your family have any traditional movies you watch around Halloween?
We don't really celebrate much, but sometimes we'll curl up with snacks and watch Halloween.
The original in the series?
Yeah. I still can't see Jamie Lee Curtis today without picturing her in that role.
Sounds like good scary times.
Yeah it's kind of a long standing tradition, too. I can remember just hearing the classic music from that or if somebody would make similar sounds and as a kid it would give me goosebumps.
Who knew that music would become so famous and such a trademark?
It's kind of like that morbid children's rhyme in the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
Don't even start with that. One time I had to turn the movie off in the middle of that song.
You gotta love the impact of those well crafted thriller movie songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think are the best thriller movies in the last, four or so years?
That is a long list.
Which movie would be at the top?
I would have to say Ex-Machina.
I have not even heard of it.
It is a real edge of your seat, keep you guessing type.
Is it about crime?
In a way. But more about AI.
Like Robots?
Yep, there is even a dance scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe it has been 25 years?
Twenty five years for what?
Since Silence of the Lambs was first released, of course.
Wow.  I cannot believe it has been that long.  Anthony Hopkins was so good in that movie.  Didn't he win an Oscar?
Yes.  For Best Actor.   No wins for Hannibal or Red Dragon though.
Well they were not nearly as good.
Do you think he regrets doing them?
He might regret playing the same character but I doubt he regrets the money.
No kidding.  Did you know the author of the screenplay never even watched the film?  And then he wrote both sequels.
No, I did not know that but I am thinking that maybe he should have watched.  Anthony Hopkins was brilliant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like scary movies or thrillers more?
Honestly? Thrillers, because I'm a huge baby about scary stuff. Why?
Oh, I'm just looking for recommendations for good thrillers from, like, the past 10-20 years.
Did you ever see any of the Jason Bourne movies?
Yeah, I didn't like them too much though. They all feel like the same movie: generic dude being chased by spies...
I guess so. I still think they're fun, though. What about Fast and Furious?
Totally, love 'em!
No offense, but that seems a little ironic. Those movies are the definition of generic, aren't they?
Yeah, but they're so-bad-they're-good status, you know? And still exciting the way thrillers should be.
I guess that's fair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the movie Donnie Darko?
I have heard of it, but I don't know what it's about
It's about a disturbed teenage boy who keeps seeing a scary rabbit
Why does he see the rabbit?
I think it's because he is a little crazy
What does he do about it?
Well he always had the choice to obey what the rabbit says or not
And how scary was the movie?
It wasn't too scary, it's actually my wife's favorite movie
Oh, it doesn't seem that bad. I really want to see it now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the last time you went to see a good Thriller movie? I went last week to see hush have you ever seen it?
No i haven't what was the movie about? Was it a good one? and scary.
You know it had to be a good one or else i wouldn't be telling you about the movie. It's from 2016 just last year.
Okay i want to know what happened and i may go check it out later myself.
Well It is starring the Actors Mike Flanagan and Kate Siegel. It starts with this deaf woman she has a friend and lives out in the middle of no where.
Wow keep going this sounds pretty interesting. go on I think i am going to be really scared i can tell by the way you look and sound.
So her friend comes over for diner but the food burns up so she leaves and goes home she came back and someone had killed her.
Killed her how can I guess? The idiot followed the girl then murders her and now wants to murder her girl-friend.
something like that yes but he get's the friend's boyfriend first then keeps trying to get inside the house to finish her off. She puts up a big fight all through the rest of the movie.
Let me guess again he kills her too. Or no don't tell me i'm going to order the movie so i can see it for my self. great Thriller Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Kill Bill?
Yes it's one of my favorite thrillers ever. Tarantino is a genius.
Yes I agree and that's my favorite movie by him.
Do you like volume 2?
I like it ok but part one has a lot more action.
I like that for whatever reason they kept her name hidden until part 2.
Just to add an air of mystery I'm sure. I love the yellow and black suit she wore.
That was to pay homage to Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury.
Well it was a great homage because she really worked it.
I've probably seen that movie a million times. The fight scenes never get old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Seven?
The one with Brad Pitt?
Yes thats the one.
No but I remember when it came out.
You must watch it.
Is it that good.
Yes it is a psychological thriller.
Ok I like going on that kind of mental adventure.
I suggest you get ready to be thrilled, it is an extreme thriller.
Ok that sounds interesting, I will watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Signs?
I loved it.
Is it the best alien movie?
No. But, it is up there.
Are there any better alien movies?
Yes. Alien.
Is that thrilling?
Yes and it's a horror movie too.
Cool. I am a fan of alien movies
Me too. I love Signs too though. It was a great story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that Ashton Kutcher movie from 15 years ago or so?
Are you talking about The Butterfly Effect?
Right.  That was a pretty decent film I thought.
One of the better ones he's ever been in I guess.
Did you ever the see alternate ending?
Nope, didn't know there was one.
In the one they put in the director's cut, he actually kills himself in the womb.
What?  That sounds crazy.
It was actually a much better ending than the original, but guess they deemed it to extreme for audiences.
It actually sounds like a much more fitting ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like foreign thriller movies?
I don't like asian horror movies. They're usually too gory.
Oh you're right.
I do like French ones though. Matryrs is great.
That's the goriest of them all!
Yeah but it has other stuff going on too
I hear belgians are doing good things
I hadn't heard that
What did you think about that greek one?
Dogtooth? I loved it. So weird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Elle last night.
Cool.  Is that the movie with Isabelle Huppert?
Yes.
Who was the director?
Paul Verhoeven
What happens in the movie?
A woman gets raped but does not report it.
Who else is in the movie?
Laurent Lafitte, Anne Consigny, and Charles Berling
Sounds interesting.  I might look it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of a movie called Battle Royale?
Yea it's based off of the book right?
Yea! That's the one.
Yea I've seen it, but I was really disappointed.
Me too, the book was much more intense.
It's a cool premise for a thriller, a bunch of kids having to kill eachother.
Yea, in fact they are making an American version of it, but in an office building.
I guess kids killing eachother would be too much these days.
I think it just makes a more interesting story to do it in a closed office space.
Yea, it's easier to make a movie about it since the area isn't huge like in the book.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Cape Fear.
Original?
No, the 1991 remake.
Who was in it?
Nick Nolte, Robert DeNiro.
Didn't the oldies have cameos?
Yes, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and Martin Balsam.
Was it any good?
It wasn't bad, especially when De Niro starts speaking in tongues.
I might watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you like to watch a movie tonight?
Sure, what kind of movie are you in the mood for?
How about some type of thriller?
Sounds good, have you seen Flight Plan?
Is that the one with Jodie Foster?
Yes! She is really great in it.
I have liked her ever since I saw The Silence Of The Lambs.
Yea, what a creepy movie that was!
So now I am excited to watch Flight Plan.
You will not regret it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Silence of the Lambs movie?
I am sure I have but it has been a while.
Yes it came out in 1991, and I was streaming it on Netflix.
Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal in that one. He plays an amazing villain in it.
Yes, it is hard to beat Anthony Hopkins.
Who was the woman again that played the FBI agent?
Jody Foster played the young FBI agent that Hannibal will speak to during the movie.
I liked her work in that movie, she was really cleaver in it.
I think they both got awards for that film.
No doubt, it is a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen wait until dark?
The one with audrey hepburn?
Yes, I assume from that response you have.
Indeed I have. It was such a different role for her.
Yes you don't typically think of her in a thriller.
True or as a blind woman.
Very true. She was very real in that role, got to show she had a wider range than thought.
I have always thought of audrey hepburn as talented.
Me as well but I feel a lot of her popularity had to do with her style and charm not always talent.
To some degree I agree very known for her fashion. But she is talent all the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you an Alfred Hitchcock fan?
Who is'nt? The man was a genious.
You can say that again! What is your favorite?
I really liked the movie Birds. That is a classic.
Yeah, that is a good one. My favorite is psycho.
That is the one he made in 1960?
Yeah that was the year. Such a great movie.
Definitely. so many unforgettable scenes.
The shower scene, when he has the big knife?
Yes! That is the one. Terrifying!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What good movies have you seen lately?
One movie that really messed with my mind is The prestige.
Oh, isn't that the movie about the magician duel?
yeah, that's one way to put it. I just love Christopher Nolan movies man.
My wife called The prestige a movie between batman and Wolverine in an alternate universe.
Seeing Christian Bale as anyone but batman is hard, he really is an embodiment of Batman.
His work in other movies aren't as great, I think that Leonardo Dicaprio plays Christopher Nolan movies well.
What other movies has he been in?
Inception was a classic and Shutter Island was another one.
Inception truly was terrifying, not knowing whether he's in reality or not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So can you suggest a good thriller to watch?
Have you seen the movie Obsessed?
Yes, I just saw that actually!
What about The Barber?
I seen that one as well. I want one that I have not seen.
I understand; have you watched In Dreams?
I do not think so actually. Who is in it?
It stars Annette Bening and Robert Downey Jr.
Is it a thriller that will keep my attention?
I think So! I absolutely loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of that show The Usual Suspects?
Yes, it is a classic already.
Well, I just downloaded it. Is it any good?
Very suspenseful, keeps you guessing.
It had the guy from K-Pax, right?
Kevin Spacey, yes.
Is it a mystery?
Sort of, it is more suspenseful. You do not even know the truth until the very end!
It has to be him.
Well, at the end you will see the guy with the limp, no longer has a limp.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What thriller ending surprised you most?
For me it was the sixth sense.
I wish I could say that.. someone told me the twist before I saw the movie.
Oh no, that sucks, that is one of the greatest reveals of movie history.
I know, and I will never be able to get that shock. Suck for sure.
So what is the  thriller ending surprised you most then?
I suppose shutter island. I was shocked when the twist was revealed in that one.
They did a good job having you believe one thing and it being a completely different reality in reality.
For sure, I find films like shutter island get more interesting although less shocking the more times I see them.
Ben kingsley's performance and character was very masterful in creating that aspect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Could you suggest a good suspense movie for me to watch?
Sure, Phonebooth is a great thriller.
I do not think I have heard of that film before.
It is really good and it will keep you in suspense throughout the whole thing!
Who are the main stars in it?
Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland are great in it.
I like both of those actors a lot.
If you like intense thrillers, then this is the movie for you!
I think you have convinced Me. Thanks for the suggestion.
No problem at all. I am glad to help out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Thriller movies at all?
Not exactly.
That is too bad.
Really?
Yeah because I recently saw the Dark Knight.
Oh how was that?
It was great!
I am more of a Spiderman person myself.
I agree spiderman is very good.
We should see it again sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Gone Girl?
Oh my, that is one freaky movie.
Yeah, I saw it in the theaters. I haven't watched in on TV because I think it'll freak me out when I'm alone.
Ha ha.  Just as long as you don't live in the Midwest.
But I do! I think the girl in that movie deserved an Oscar.
Yeah, she was great. Affleck was great too.
I feel bad for him at the end.  I mean, he's bad but not that bad.
I agree. I mean, she was a murderer.
And had tried to get him to framed for murder.
Yeah, that was a suprising movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Sixth Sense before?
It came out in 1999, right? I think I have seen Bruce Willis play in that one.
Yes, Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment play in that movie.
You must have seen a re-run of it!
Yes, it was movie weekend! I rented it!
I remember the child having supernatural abilities in that one.
Yes, he can speak to ghosts and see them , sometimes they scare him.
That would be terrifying!
Yes, it had quite a dark secret that he helped another ghost, played by Bruce Willis, figure out.
Yes, I love that movie, it was intense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like that in time movie?
Was that the one with justin timberlake?
Yes
Yes i loved that movie
Me too
Ive seen it a whole bunch of times
Ive seen it a few
I want a sequel to that one
Me too
That would be interesting
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new thriller movie Split?
No, I wanted to, buy haven't yet.  Any good?
James Mccavoy is awesome in it.
The previews looked really good.
He was very convening as each character.
I heard it ties in with Unbreakable.
It does, it is a continuation that connects at the end.
Was Bruce Willis in this?
no, but will be in the next one.
I will have to go rent it today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Girl on the Train?
Yes it was very suspenseful!
Was the  movie also a book?
Yes I thought the book was better than the movie.
Did you think the movie was scary?
I thought it was really scary at the end of the movie!
How many main characters do you remember there being?
I think there was two couples involved.
What did you think of the couples?
The worst character was the one man who had affairs with both women.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who gave the best performance in The Usual suspects?
For me hands down Kevin Spacey.
He was good. But I preferred Stephen Baldwin.
McManus was a good character but SPacey's acting blows his out of the water.
Benicio Del Toro was also brilliant in this film.
I feel like he is always great.
True, I can't think of a role I thought he did poorly in.
Agreed. He looks so much like brad pitt to me too.
I never made that connection or comparison before, but I think you are correct.
They could be brothers from a different mother. so similar when you look at them side by side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I been watching this good thriller movie its interesting
What is it called?
Well it is based on a video game
What video game?
It is called max payne it is quite interesting
Oh yeah i played the games
The plot in this is better than the games i think
So you would recommend it
Most definitely i do its really good
Can i borrow your copy when your done then?
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched a thriller that is based on a James Patterson book.
What was it called?
Along Came A Spider.
I might have seen that. Is it older?
Yes, it's from 2001.
Who was in it?
Morgan Freeman.
No, wrong movie. Was it good?
Yeah, it was great.
I'll take your word and look for it on Netflix.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Amusement?
No, is that a comedy film?
It's actually more of a thriller type flick.
What a funny name for a thriller.
Yeah, it's like a series of little horror stories.
What is it about?
Each vignette is about something different. Once is about a clown who kidnaps a babysitter.
I think I've seen another thriller film like that before.
It's based on The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs.
Yes, that's it! What a creepy story!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Deep Blue Sea?
The one with Samuel L Jackson?
Yea and L.L. Cool J.
Yea! That was a fun movie.
It sure was. You can't go wrong with super intelligent sharks.
Yea, what was your favorite scene?
Definitely when Samuel L Jackson get's eaten after his speech!
Yea mine too!
That totally took me by surprise.
I know, I thought for sure he was going to be the only survivor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
Yes I love James Bond.
Me too. Which one is your favorite?
Dr. No.
So Sean Connery is your favorite Bond?
Yes for sure.
Interesting.
Which is yours?
Daniel Craig.
He is good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best gun battle you've seen in a movie?
Has to be Heat when they were on the streets of LA.
Oh yeah, that was just fantastic.
I remember the sound the most.  The bullets just echo off the street and buildings.
That was a great movie throughout.  I liked the ending too.
You mean at the airport?
Right, the cat and mouse games and how he sees his shadow at the end.
Yeah, very tense.
I wish Pacino and Deniro would make another movie.
Hopefully someday, but not banking on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Sherlock Holmes?
Yeah, Robert Downey Junior was great.
I know, he pulled out that quirkiness perfectly.
He was quite funny.  I liked the second one too with Moriarty.
Yeah, classic Sherlock Homles.  And how he faked his own death.
Yep, just like in the novels.
What do you think of Benedict Cumberbatch?
He's perfect.  Him and Downy are both fantastic.
I agree.  Both great actors.
And they seem to hold pretty true to the stories and who Sherlock really is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that movie with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman?
Far and Away?
No, the other one.  It was really weird.
Oh, Eyes Wide Shut.
Yeah, that's it.  Did you ever see it?
Yeah, I heard a lot about it.  So one night I saw it was on and I watched it.
Did you like it?
It was really weird.  I don't remember exactly what went on.
I heard there's a lot of weird sex stuff.
Yes, that's why it was weird.  They had this crazy secret torture group or something too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies that mess with your mind?
Yeah, as long as it's not too creepy
Have you heard of Memento?
Yeah, I saw it on Netflix a while ago!
What do you remember from it?
It's about a guy with short term memory loss and he is trying to find a murderer
Yeah, he wants to find who killed his wife
How did she die again?
I can't tell you, that would give the plot away!
I'll watch it again I guess, I just remember liking the ending a lot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched any thrilling movies in the past few months?
I saw a great thriller recently about called Split.
You mean the one about the man with multiple personalities?
Yes, he kidnaps 3 girls and holds them hostage.
Did it have a happy ending?
Actually no it did not.
I read that it's connected to another thriller movie also directed my M. Night Shyamalan.
Yes i read that as well, the movie is called Unbreakable. It's also a really good movie.
Who are the stars?
Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Name your favorite thriller movie of all time.
It has to be the Sixth Sense.
Why do you say that?
It is what started it all for M. Night.
I agree. It also started the whole twist thing in movies.
Yes, the twist at the end was shocking.
It was one of the few movies I actually liked Bruce willis in.
I agree, he gave an amazing performance.
It was one of the more creepier movies I've seen.
I watched it as a child, and didn't sleep a week after that without a light on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
That would have to be Silence of the Lambs.
Man, i have seen that one.  Hannible really freaked me out.
yeah, anthony hopkins did a really good job playing that character.
i think buffalo bill may have been worse though.  that character was really demented.
he definitely had some mental issues.
yeah, i can see someone wanting to be a woman, but killing women to make a suit out of their skin?  creepy.
very true.  the way he kept them down in that pit was the worst part.
it was kind of cool how hannible helped starling catch him in the end though.
yeah, and the fact that he called her after he escaped asking about her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Sixth Sense?
I missed that one.
You have to watch it, it is really well done.
What is it about?
It is a thriller and full of suspense.
That sounds interesting.
Yes the acting is excellent and a really believable story.
Wow that helps with getting really involved with movies.
Yes and this movie is super gripping and intense, its definitely excellent.
Thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember Silence of the Lambs and I thought it crazy at the time.
Me too. Now it seems so mild in comparison to what is out there now.
I know. I thought Anthony Hopkins was really good in it, but now now it feels over acted.
I know what you mean. When you see Red Dawn and some of the others I have to agree.
Which one was Edward Norton in? He was the detective. Red Dragon. You were almost right.
Yeah, then there was also Hannibal Rising.
I don't remember that one. When did it come out? Did you see it?
I think it was 2007. It's about Hannibal's family being killed and what happened to him after.
So it's the prequel telling you how he got to be the way he was.
Interesting that might be worth checking out. All these movies out of sequence is so confusing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what i find funny
What do you find funny
When Actors play in thrillers when they feel out of place
What do you mean exactly
Well like Nicholas Cage he just feels out of place
I think he is perfect for some of his roles
Nah national treasure he just looks funny
Funny?
Yeah he is more comedy than anything
Well i can see that but i disagree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Taken movies?
Yes I did. They were pretty good.
I think I like the first one best but they were all cool.
Yeah I think so too.
I like Liam Neeson.
Yeah I like him also.
Did you see him in Non Stop?
Yes that kept you guessing.
Yes for sure.
You didn't know which one was the bad guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies that sort of mess with your head?
Psychological thrillers?
Yes, like Momento.
I love those kind, the ones that make you question your own mind.
I like the ones that make me wonder the star is crazy, or it is all real.
Like Rear Window?
The old Cary Grant movie, yes.
I was so convinced he was crazy for half the movie.
I think that was the point.
I loved the ending, when it all ended well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Seen any good thrillers lately?
Like thriller movies?
Yeah that.
I saw one recently that I streamed.
What did you see?
I watched Memento.  Have you seen that?
Yes that is a great thriller.
One of the best I've seen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
I would say Inception.
That's one of my favorites too!
What do you like about inception?
I like how it teases that there are several layers to reality.
Do you like its pacing?
Oh, yeah, it's very fast-paced. Feels like you're on the seat of your pants the whole time!
Do you like the time magnification aspect?
Yes, the fact that seconds take days in one dream makes it really fascinating.
It's a really cool take on dreams.

It is Friday night! I am in the mood to see a good thriller movie!
Oh geez! You know how I feel about thriller movies.
I know! I love watching you jump during the scariest part of the movie.
Well, don't let me hold the popcorn this time. What do you want to see?
How do you feel about Annabelle; Creation?
I have never seen any of the Annabelle movies because they're too creepy.
Annabelle is one of my favorite thriller genres within the last five years.
How about we see a romantic comedy?
No thanks. If you see a thriller movie with me tonight, I will see a romantic comedy with you next time around.
Sounds like we have a deal!
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite thrillers is Taken, have you seen it?
Yes I saw it when it first came out.
Did you like it?
Yes I thought it was great.
You should watch it again.
Why is that.
Liam Neeson is great in it.
Ok yes I do like him.
Yes he is a great actor.
Yes I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Scream?
Maybe?  That thriller movie from the 90s?
Yes!  With the guy in the ghost mask.
I think I have but its been a long time.  Who is in it?
Drew Berrymore, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Rose McGowan.
Oh yeah.  And David Arquette, right?
Yes!  I love that movie.
I thought it was okay.
It is one of my favorites!  It was so hard to figure out who the killers were.
Yeah - that part was definitely cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider Fight Club a thriller?
I could argue for and against that claim.
Well I think its a thriller because you are waiting to see whats going on
It had one of the best plot twists I have ever seen.
Yeah Edward Norton and Brad Pitt did such a good job in it.
I think their acting made it such a good twist
I didnt see them being the same character.
And the rest of the cast was great too
Leto played a great role
Yeah he did and I loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you watching?
Misery.
Oh, one of my favourites! Let me know how you think it is compared to the book.
I've never actually read the book. Not a big Stephen King fan.
But you like the movies?
Yeah, I just meant I'm not a fan of his books. I like the movie adaptations just fine.
I gotcha. I thought the book was great, though this is probably the only instance where I thought the movie was just as good.
Ah, good to know. Is there anything I should know from the book?
Not really? I mean, it's more detailed of course but there's nothing major that comes to mind.
Okay. Plus, the book doesn't have Kathy Bates in it and I like her in this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Panic Room?
A long time ago, I did.
Seems like it's one of the last films I've seen with Jodie Foster.
She hasn't been in much lately.
I always thought the idea was kind of weird.  The room wouldn't really protect you.
Short-term maybe, but they could eventually wait you out.
Right, you're locked in.  Even with supplies, what are you going to do?
Yeah, it's not like a fallout shelter.
Anyway, I would never have one in my house.  I've got too much stuff!
It would also be very costly to put one in!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wild Things is a good thriller
Neve Campbell and Denise Richards are good in it.
Don't forget Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon.
That was a good thriller for 1997.
Yeah it was a good follow up after Scream  for Neve Campbell
She did a good job
That twist ending was great
Yeah, Bill Murray added a lot of comedy too.
There is a lot to like about that movie.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Shallows?
Yea, I hated it.
Why? It was so good!
No, it was dumb. I mean who get's stuck on a reef.
You never know. Maybe lots of people that go missing, actually got stuck on reefs.
Hah! sure. But anyway, Blake Lively is a bad actress.
I thought she was great. And so beautiful.
Yea she's beautiful, but she's no shark killer.
Yea, I kind of don't like it when shark movies have happy endings.
Same here, people can't beat monster sharks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have ever wacthed the movie The Crazies?
No, isn't that a horror movie?
Horror/thriller movie, to be exact.
Okay, what's the plot?
Ogden Marsh, a small town in Lowa, starts seeing odd, violent behavior from some of it's residents?
Okay, so do we know what's happening, or does it remain a mystery?
Yes, as it turns out a Army plane carrying a bioweapon called Trixie crashed in the nearby swamp and contaminated the water supply.
Okay, what does Trixie do, in regards to "odd, violent behavior"?
After a 48 hour incubation period, the infected become cruel, calculated, and deranged killers who often work together to kill the uninfected.
Okay, sounds like a good scary movie, I might give it a look.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You remember when Halle Berry played a phone operator and she went after a killer?
Yes, and the hostage was calling from the inside of a car trunk?
What about Bruce Willis in the movie "The Sixth Sense."
That was good but I didn't get it until the ending. I couldn't believe Bruce Willis was dead all through the movie.
In a strange kind of way put you in mind of the "Ocean's Eleven" movies doesn't it?
Yeah and I'm not sure which one had more twists and turns. I like movies that make me think.
Well then you loved Samuel Jackson in "The Hateful Eight" didn't you?
It was alright. The best part was when Samuel Jackson cold cocked that lady was handcuffed. (laughs)
You're sick, that wasn't funny.Now what was funny and full of thrills was "The Long Kiss Good night" with Darryl Hannah.
Samuel Jackson was in that one too wasn't he. I don't why but that movie reminds on Jamie Foxx movie "Law Abiding Citizen."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that thriller movie, 'Split'?
Is that the one about a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps some girls?
Yeah. James McAvoy did a really good job playing that character. I was creeped out every time he came on screen.
It's an M. Night Shyamalan film, isn't it?
Yeah, that's the director.
He's pretty famous for his thrillers.
Yeah, he even directed 'The Sixth Sense.' That's got to be a classic by now.
Would you say 'Split' measures up to his other films?
I'd say it's one of his best. It's actually a sequel to the thriller movie, 'Unbreakable.'
Oh, yeah. That's the one about people with superhuman powers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Shutter Island?
I've seen that movie over a hundred times. It's great.
Leonardo Dicaprio did that movie a lot of justice.
Martin Scorsese directed it, too.
I actually didn't know that.
The fact that the lady drowned her kids was so haunting to me.
Yeah and escaped the hospital for the criminally insane.
Yeah, she was a very detailed character.
The way the movie kept a sense of mystery was the best part about it.
It really was. I couldn't look away until I figured out what happened.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched a classic thriller movie the other night.
Yeah, which one?
Seven.
It's just called Seven?
Yes. Brad Pitt is in it.
What's that about?
A killer who uses the seven deadly sins for his basis to kill.
So you mean like greed, wrath and so on?
Yes. It's great. Old but great.
I'll have to check it out. I never saw it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see "The Silence of the Lambs?"
No, I haven't. Does it star Anthony Hopkins?
Yes it does! They also made a sequel and prequel to it.
I think I heard they had to deage him for the prequel.
They did. I really recommend seeing all three.
Are they really a thriller or are they a blend of comedy and jump scares?
They are truely a thriller. Not a blend at all.
Good. I don't like when they blend things.
It is worth the time to watch them all.
I will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good thriller movies lately?
Yeah,I saw that new Johnny Depth movie
Oh,what was the name of it?
Secrect Window
Oh yeah,I saw that movie as well
It was just great wasn't it?
Out of this world!.I have not saw that good of a movie in a long time.
I loved the roles that Johnny Depth's character and his wife played
Oh I loved them as well.
I especially loved the twist that came at the end
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see that movie Misery?
About the author?
Yeah, based on a Stephen King movie, had Kathy Bates.
I remember it quite well.
That scene with the blocks and the hammer just frightens me.
Oh geez, that's the worst part of the movie.
It gives me chills everytime I see it in the wrong way.
It's one of the more punishing things I've ever seen in film.
Quite frankly, it gives me pause to ever being an author.
Or having a caretaker that's a complete psycho.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've really been into the old thriller movies latetly.
Really, which ones have you been wathcing?
I watched Nightmeare on Elm Street the other night.
That was a super scarey movie when I was growing up.
Yeah, Freddie Krueger was a maniac!
For sure, that guy gave me nightmears!
Any thriller type movies that you enjoy?
I liked the Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis.
I forgot about that one.  That was so suspensful and I didn't know what was going on until the end.
Me too.  It all made sense when I found out Bruce Willis was really dead the entire time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Mission Impossible
What did you think of the second one?
It was good!
WHat did you like about it?
The girl
Yea, she was super hot!
I had a poster of her on my wall in college
Me too!
I'm so googling her right now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is one of the freakiest thriller movies you've ever watched lately?
I watched Split with my family. It was okay. Didn't know it was an M. Night Shyamalan movie until I was already in the movie!
Yeah M Night made a few good movies with a twist in my opinion.
This one reminds me of Sybil, who i think had multiple personalities also. Pretty much the same kinda split personalities genre with an M Knight flavor if you will.
I personally think James Mc Avoy was okay, but I told my wife when we watched the movie that I think Joaquin Phoenix would've been a better cast than James.
I thought so too and surprisingly he was actually considered first for the role before James but he was unavailable at that time.
I thought it was more of a mixture of thriller, and a bit of horror also.
Yeah, without giving too much spoiler, I guess you're right kinda a bit of a horror movie towards the end although not in a ghost kinda way.
True. I wonder if they have a sequel based on the last minute of the show.
We shall see. M Night's movie tend to have that open ending sometimes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats the most recent thriller movie you've seen?
Hmm, it's been a while, but I watched the Ring a couple weeks ago.
The Ring? As in the original from years ago?
Exactly, it was recently added on Netflix.
That movie is definetely scary, if I remember it correctly.
Yep, it has the scene of the girl coming out of the TV.
It's crazy! And she looked so demented.
Sometimes I dream about that scene, no joke.
Well, I can't watch The Ring at night for that very reason.
I don't blame you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Lost Highway
That's a great movie!
Yea it is definitely my favorite!
What did you think of the soundtrack
I wore the CD out when I was a kid
Haha!  That's awesome!
Yea we used to play it after every party
A true fan of the movie
Yea, all my friends were!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies filmed in Africa?
Yes I do but most are not too exciting.
There is one that is an amazing thriller.
What is it called.
It is called Blood Diamond.
Is that a good movie?
It may be the best movie.
Wow it is that good?
Yes it is so thrilling and shows the beauty of Africa.
Ok I will watch
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Split?
No, I haven't had the chance yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I've heard some good things about it.
It's quite creepy, and James McAvoy does such an excellent job with portraying his character.
Oh, you mean with all the versions of his character?
Yeah, of course. I just didn't want to include any spoilers for you.
Don't worry. I already heard about him portraying a character with 23 different personalities.
Actually, in the end there were 24. How's that for a little spoiler?
That's interesting. Even more excited to see it now.
The rest of the actors do a really good job as well. Especially Anya Taylor-Joy in the role of Casey Cooke.
I'm not too familiar with her actually. It will be interesting to discover some new talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Stephen Kings movies? He's my favorite author!
Yes. My favorite of his is The Shining
I love all of his movies but my all time favorite is The Stand
I don't think I've ever seen that
Really?! You need to watch it! It was a miniseries on tv. I also love Cujo and Carrie
Me too, I've seen both of those too.
Carrie was really good! when I first saw it, I was like 13. Scared me back then lol
Lol..it is a creepy movie that's for sure
The Shining was also great! Try to read and watch The Stand. The movie is just as good as the book though
Okay. I probably will do that soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Fatal Attraction good?
Yes
Was Michael Douglas in it?
Yes
He is always good in his films. Did you like what they did with the rabbit?
That made me sad.
Glenn Close was excellent in that film.
I love the way they built up the suspense
The ending was really good.
Yeah. It had a great ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Get Out was such a good thriller.
i thought that Jordan Peele did a great job
I was surprised because of his experience in comedy
The lighting of the movie was superb
Yeah it helped with character development
The eeriness of some of the characters was odd
Yeah it helped make the movie strange
do you think they could do another one?
possibly but it would be odd
I loved how the scenes played out where you didnt know what was going on
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Inception.
I never saw it.  Who's in it?
Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Tom Berenger.
I loved Ellen Page in Juno.
Yes, she was fun in that one.
Who directed the movie?
Christopher Nolan.
What's the movie about?
DiCaprio gets secrets by getting in people's dreams.
Neat.  I might watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did,you see Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds?
Of course I have.
I think I've seen all of his thrillers.
That was a favorite of mine.
Yes,it's one of his best.
Rod Taylor was great.
So was Tipi Hedren.
Yes,and a real young Suzanne Pleshette.
Yes,Bob Newharts wife.
On tv only though
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you like Jodie Foster, you must see Silence of the Lambs.
I've always wanted to see it.  Tell me more.
It's about a serial killer.  He's played by Anthony Hopkins.
Oh, he's good.  Is he scary in this?
Yes, he is very scary.  You won't forget the performance.
Didn't he win an Oscar for that?
He did win an Oscar for the performance.  It's deserved.
Do Foster and Hopkins have a lot of chemistry?
I thought they had great chemistry.  They complement each other well, and it's an intelligent film.
I'll see it soon.  I like films with bite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the difference between a thriller movie and a horror movie?
In my opinion, the movie genres are very similar.  Sometimes the words can be used interchangeable to describe the same movie.
At first, I thought that horror movies dealt more with the supernatural--like The Paranormal movies.
You have movies that are called thrillers that also incorporate the supernatural like The Shining.
True.  I have to admit that I have never really liked supernatural horror movies because I never get scared!
Have you seen Silence of the Lambs?
Yes.  Now, that movie is unnerving to me.
I would classify that as a thriller movie.
I think it is unnerving to me because it is closer to reality than a movie with the supernatural.  The actor who played the serial killer Buffalo Bill freaked me out.
That is a good point.  Someone like Buffalo Bill has or probably does exist in our world right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the silence of the Lambs?
Is that the one about Hannibal?
Yes it is.
No but I know what it is about.
It is a really great watch, a true thriller and it is suspenseful.
I like those kinds of movies.
You would enjoy this, it is a great movie.
It has a great story.
Yes it is unique for the time it came out, and a true pioneer of a movie.
Wow that sounds important, I will give it a watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally watched it! That M. Night Shymalan thriller!
The new one? You saw Split!
Yes, that's it! Super freaky! James McAvoy really showed his talent in that film!
No kidding! It was amazing how he portrayed all of those different personalities and really seemed like different people!
Especially the woman, Patricia! At first I thought it was a lady!
True, me too! He was incredible as Hedwig "etc.".
Good one! That line cracked me up! I think he was my favorite.
I liked the designer, Barry? Was that his name?
I think so! Did you get the twist at the end?
As soon as I saw Bruce Willis!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best thriller of all time?
That is a really tough question to answer!
I think it has to be Frailty.
I do not think I have seen that one.
It is a great movie that is extremely underrated.
Does anyone famous play in it?
Yes, it stars Bill Paxton and Matthew McConaughey.
Is it really scary or what?
I won't give away to much, but I did not sleep well after I watched it!
Well, I am not sure if I Should watch it or not!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see No Country For Old Men?
Yes, it was great. Javier Bardem was amazing in that.
Who did that movie?
That was the Coen Brothers.
Oh nice. Didn't they do Fargo too?
Yes and The Big Lebowski, but my favorite is No Country For Old Men
Who is in that movie besides Bardem?
Tommy Lee Jones
I love him
He plays a cop in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller?
I think that is is Shutter Island.
The Leonardo Di Caprio movie? That one?
Yeah! It was brilliant and scary.
Is Ben Kingsley in that movie as well?
He is! He plays the lead doctor.
Why do the U.S. Marshalls get stuck on the island at the beginning of the movie?
They got stuck because of a bad storm!
What a way to start a psychological thriller. It's always scary to be stuck in an unfamiliar and odd place.
Absolutely. They really pulled me in from the start.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
Are you a fan of thriller films?
Yeah sure, I like those.
What was the last one you saw?
That's a good question.
Take your time.
It was probably It.
Oh cool, how was that?
It was very creepy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the last best thriller movie you've seen?
I really liked Paranormal Activity.
Really? Nothing more recent?
It Follows and Babadook were pretty good too.
What did you think of Get Out?
Oh, that was pretty clever too. But not so much scary.
I saw one about a girl who gets chased by a blind guy
Oh yeah that one was good too. Filmed in Detroit?
Yeah. that's the one. The Shining is still the best overall.
I agree. It's a masterpiece.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally got around to seeing Inception yesterday.
Oh yeah?  What did you think?
It was kind of confusing, but very cool to watch.
All Christopher Nolan films are pretty awesome.
So I don't really get the end.  What happened?
It's up to you to interpret it.  Maybe he's in a dream, maybe he's not.
I think he never woke up.  That's why the top didn't stop spinning.
But at the end, it nearly fell over.
Yeah, but it cut out so you'll never know.
Right.  I guess that was the point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch that new Wolverine movie?
I did not. What was it called again? Something different, I know.
"Logan!"
Ahh, that is right.
Yeah, it was great.
Was it action-packed?
Definitely. And Hugh Jackman did an excellent job.
I'll have to go check it out for sure.
Heck, I'd go see it again. Just let me know.
Sounds good. You know I love some Wolverine!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to find a good movie to watch!
I have a lot of movies, what are you in the mood for?
Something suspenseful! I love a good thriller.
Have you ever seen Eye For An Eye?
Not sure, who is in it?
Sally Field plays a woman looking for revenge after her daughter is murdered.
That sounds really good actually.
It is, Sally Field is very talented.
Yea I love all of her movies basically.
I will bring it on over and we will watch it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally seen The shinning.
Ah, what did you think of the creepy twins?
They were so scary!
The whole thing was, what scared you the most?
Maybe Nichloson's son in the movie, when he kept saying "Red Rum".
Murder, backwards. I freaked out at the axe scene.
He said "Here's Johnny!".
That was added in by the actor. Not in the script.
Wow, he really took that character on, head on didn't he?
Yes, I heard he stayed in character the whole time during filming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see that Don't Breathe movie?
I might have.  Wasn't that the one about the teen thieves?
Kind of.  They broke into this guy's house and the guy is blind.
Right.  But all of his other senses are really heightened.
Yep.  So he ends up hunting them in his house.
Kind of a weird dynamic.  The kids aren't good guys, but neither is he.
In some ways, they got what they deserved.
To a point, but being killed for trespassing is pretty harsh.
On a whole, it's worth watching once, but would never buy it.
Agreed.  I feel that way about most of these run of the mill thriller flicks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Departed was on TV last night.
Man! That is such a good show!
One of my favorites.
Didn't that win an award?
The Oscar for best picture.
I thought so. Scorsese is a genious.
I can't believe a few the actors didn't get awarded.
The Oscars hate DeCaprio.
Haha. This is true.
Sorry I missed that....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Dark Knight?
Yes I did.  Awesome Joker.
Yeah Health Ledger was amazing.
A different take.  He was kind of scary.
Yeah, plus him and Bale had a good back and fourth.
Don't forget two Face.
Yeah a little overlooked due to Ledger and his Joker.
I know.  Unfairly so because he was awesome too.
I like how Batman at the end took the blame for Dent dying too.
Right, with that closing line about him being tough enough to take it as Gotham's Dark Knight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite old thriller, a classic.
Wait Until Dark, with Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin.
Why do you like it so much?
First of all, Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses, and secondly it's a fantastic movie.
What's it about?
It's about a blind woman who lives in an apartment and drug smugglers are looking for a heroin filled doll and think she has it.
Oh, wow! That's different!
I guess you could say that, but it's the acting and the suspense that make it so good.
I'm going to have to look for that one, it sounds like something I'd like to watch.
You won't be sorry if you do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Black Swan
Isnt that witih Mila Kunez?
Yea, she's a dancer in that movie
What's so good about it?
It goes through the troubles of what typical dancers face
Tell me more...
She has a lesbian scene with a girl
Now we're talking!
Haha!  I knew that would work!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe we used to get scared at movies like Halloween and Carrie?
I know. It seems so ridiculous now.
When I flip through the channels and see one of those old ones on, I just laugh at the thought of ever being scared of one of those films.
I remember growing up watching, The Birds.
Oh gosh, me too. I haven't seen it in years.
It terrified me. I couldn't stand the scene where the birds are flying at them and they're trying to run away.
I bet if we watched it today, it wouldn't be nearly as scary as it was then.
I'm sure you're right.
I haven't seen any recent thriller movies. They all look really dumb to me.
That's probably what our parents said back when we were kids about the ones we went to see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie "Saw"?
Yes! it is a scary movie about a man named" Jig Saw" who torture bad people.
They have 6 to 8 parts that movie, a new part 8 is coming out this summer.
Part 1 was the best and part 3 was pretty good too.
Do you like the movie "Friday the 13"?
Yes! there are several parts to that movie too.
I heard a new version is coming out this summer of the movie" Friday the 13".
Yea! I heard that too.
I wonder if any good Aliens movie are coming out this summer?
Yes, there is, a new version of the movie " Aliens" is coming out this year, I like all the "Alien movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Idris Elba's performance in No Good Deed?
I think he was great. I can't say the same about the movie, though.
I guess that means you didn't like it? I thought it was good.
It started off okay, but it missed the mark in a few areas for me.
Like where?
Well, I thought that around the end it was too convenient how Henson's character escaped being tied up.
Oh, you mean how the broken glass was within reach for her?
Yeah, I think it would have been better if her daughter came in a untied her. The girl was just a prop in the whole movie.
Maybe. I still liked it.
I liked it, too. It just had some bad writing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Silence of the Lambs thrilling?
It is very thrilling and a great film.
Who is in it?
Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins.
Who is the bad guy?
Hannibal Lecter.
Is that played by Anthony Hopkins>
Yes, he does a great job.
Who directed it?
Jonathan Demme.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey look, When A Stranger Calls is coming on tonight.
Which one?
There's more than one?
Yeah! There was that old one from the 1979 and then there was a sequel and then they remade it in 2006.
Oh, I didn't know that. It looks like the newer one is on.
Okay. I didn't think it was as good as the original personally but it has its own merit.
I've seen this one before and thought it was pretty good, suspenseful and scary without too many jump scares.
Me too, I think it has sufficient build up and the music was a good choice for it.
But it doesn't beat the original for you?
It really can't compare to the original, though I like them both just the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Heat?
You mean with Al Pacino and Robert Dinero?
Yes, that's the one.
I saw it. That was a good movie.
They say it's a drama but I think it's a thriller because of the bank robbery plots and the plot to catch the crew.
I would call it a thriller as well.
Did you know that Dinero and Pacino did not film the movie together?
What are you talking about?
They were never on the set at the same time. Every scene together one is facing another, never side by side or touching.
I think I do remember hearing something like that. It's still a good movie though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, have you seen any good movies lately?
Hmm, it depends, what do you consider to be a good movie?
Well,I personally go for thriller types
Thriller types, huh? What's your favorite?
Well, there's always the classic "Psycho."
Oh man! What an oldie.
Haha, yeah. Hitchcock is timeless
What about a newer movie?
I think Inception is my favorite newer thriller.
Oh yeah, I saw that in theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that movie "The Usual Suspects" from 1995?
Good grief, was it back in 1995? Yeah, that was such a good movie.
The cast on that movie was so good. How many were there?
Five I think. You know Kevin Spacey was such the standout performance. Acting 2 roles.
I know. It was such a twist. I never expected it.
Me either. It was an awesome surprise. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
I thought the way the plot unfolded was brilliant. The perspective was creative.
I know. I couldn't get over how good it was. I like movies that are not so obvious and make you think.
Having the start in the police station and the story Verbal Kent telling his story....
Yeah, that was genius. I loved it to the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of the movie where Tom Hanks was a captain?
On a plane?
No, he was on a boat.
Oh, the one with the pirates?
Yeah, that one.  Do you know the name?
Yeah, it was Captain Phillips.
Did you see it?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
That's what I'm hearing.  I was trying to look it up.
Yeah, you really should see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I tend to think of Die Hard as a Christmas movie, but I think it's also a great thriller.
Well, it certainly is an exciting movie.
Especially the first one. Like, the premise is so interesting.
Because of John McClaine?
Well, no, because of the villain, Hans Gruber.
What about him?
He's a very megalomaniacal character. And his scheme is really brilliant.
He also has a great downfall.
That's important for any good villain.
I should try watching Die Hard again sometime soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Bonny and Clyde a good movie?
Yes. The performances are perfect.
Is it very thrilling?
There are tons of thrills in it
Is the end really thrilling?
Yeah. It is unexpected too.
I like Warren Beatty and Fay Dunaway a lot.
They go good together.
Is Gene Wilder in it too?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
The movie 16 Blocks was crazy.
I know! I just caught that on TV a few months ago.
I thought the plot was a bit ridiculous. I mean, how many people could have wanted to kill that convict guy?
Apparently a lot, if it caused Bruce Willis so much grief to get him 16 blocks to court.
That hostage scene on the bus in that movie was a bit too intense for me. I was worried something bad would happen.
Yeah, that movie had a few moments where Iw wasn't sure if people would make it out alive.
Fortunately, the movie had a happy ending.
I know! I loved the birthday scene.
Me too. I feel like they haven't made many movies like that one recently.
I agree. I wish they would!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the name of the guy that was in Silence of the Lambs?
What's Silence of the Lambs?
Seriously?  The movie with Hannibal Lector!
Oh, Hannibal is Anthony Hopkins.
Who played the detective?
I think it was Jodie Foster.
Yeah, that was it!
Why do you ask?
I was trying to look up the sequels by their names.
Oh, I hadn't realized there were sequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the movie Split considered to be a thriller movie?
I think it is a horror thriller movie. Have you seen it?
No I have not seen it. Have you?
I saw it in theaters when it first came out. It is a great movie by M. Night Shyamalan.
I heard it is related to another one of his movies.
It has ties to Unbreakable. They say they are making a sequel that will include characters from both movies.
Oh that could be very interesting. What are the names of the two main actors from Split?
The main guy is James McAvoy and the girl is Anya Taylor-Joy.
I like James. He looks really scary in the trailers I have seen.
He is a great actor. He does a good job in the movie playing all those different people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever see No Country for Old Men?
Yes that movie was cool.
It kept you on the edge of your seat.
Yes for sure.
What about The Fugitive?
Yes that was a good one also.
Can you imagine getting blamed for something you didn't do?
I know I think I would run too.
For sure otherwise you would be in jail forever.
Yes the poor's guy wife's get murdered and he doesn't even do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't especially like thriller movies.
Oh really?  Why not?
I tend to get really tense. I can't relax.
I am like that too. But there are times I think it's fun.
I really didn't like The Ring. I would never watch it again.
Did it scare you?
Yes!  The image of the girl coming out of the well was scary!
I agree. It stuck with me for a while.
I guess that means it was a good thriller movie!
Yes that's true. It was genuinely scary!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I recently tried to reanalyze "No Country for Old Men" and I must say the film is truley a piece of art.
You have to give praise where praise is due and the Cohen Brothers deserve every bit of it for that movie.
The Cohen brothers followed the orginial book almost to a T with the screenplay, a lot of the literary stuff in the film comes straight from the book.
Since you said you analyzed the film, could you tell me the importance of the coin?
The coin’s purpose is interchangeable and it can be used as currency, a weapon, a lucky token, or even a a screwdriver.
What's the point behind it though? You didn't answer my question.
The point of the coin is there to portray the randomness of the entire film. Remember Chigurh? Well he used the coin as a weapon but remeber the scene where Anton uses a penny to remove some screws?
What does the coin have to do with Chigurh and Anton?
Anton Chigurh is seemingly the perfect tool, nothing stops him in his quest to do whatever it is he wants to do, but he still busted by nature and this proves he is a mortal man. The same is shown by the use of the coin, it can be used in a multitude of ways, but in the end the coin is still a coin.
So the film attempts to prove the randomness and chaotic personality of nature. Got it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see Jason Bourne that came out 2016?
No i didn't but I heard it did 415 million
It was the #1 movie. I think I want to watch it tonight.
Bourne Identity was good so You should be safe on this one.
You know how many times something will be touted to be so great and then in your opinion it just left you lacking?
Ye but I think we do that to ourselves by putting too much credibility on the hype surrounding the movie.
That could be so but it always go the other way.
I have had that happen too. When some one tells you a movie is really bad and then you wind up liking it.
I think I am going to give it a try.
Let me know your opinion on how it measured up to your expectations.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you enjoy thriller movies?
Yeah I do like them.  Do you?
Yeah I enjoy them quite a bit.
What is a good one that you saw recently?
I saw Oldboy for the first time recently.
I'm not familiar with that one.
It's a foreign film with a lot of action and a crazy plot.
Sounds like something I might like!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched that movie Hush last night. I loved it!
The one with the deaf girl who lives alone in a cabin in the woods?
Yes, that's the one! She gets stalked by a masked killer.
I really liked that one too! In fact, I was thinking of watching it again. It was really suspenseful.
I thought it was pretty amazing how they filmed the whole thing with hardly any dialogue.
I agree, it must be a really difficult challenge to make a film like that, especially for the actress.
Although to be honest, I think it probably caused other parts of the film to suffer.
Really? How so?
Well for example, they didn't do a great job with the back story of the killer.
Now that I think about it, you're right. He didn't have much motive. But it was still a very enjoyable film!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch kissing by sharon sala
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Are you a fan of thriller movies?
Yeah sure I've seen some good ones.
What is your favorite one?
Have you seen No Country for Old Men?
Yeah I loved that movie.
That would probably be my favorite one.
It is an amazing Coen brothers film.
I love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm afraid to go out on the boat this weekend.
Why's that?
I just watched Jaws on Netflix.
Oh boy.  That wasn't a smart idea.
I'm not sure what's more scary: the shark or the music.
Definitely the music.  That's a classic theme.
But so simple.  It's a very simplistic piece of music
And uber-effective.  It's too bad the sequels were so poor.
They made sequels?
Forget I said anything.  They're not worth the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any good thriller movies out in theaters?
No. "The Mummy" is atrocious, but "American Assassin" might be fun.
Isn't that based off of the Mitch Rapp novels?
Yes. The trailers make it look fun.
I wonder how they might make it different from the Jack Ryan movies.
It should be more energetic and modern.
What makes you think that?
Hollywood likes to repeat itself a lot, but I think that Michael Keaton will take it to the next level.
If he's in it, I'm going to see it.
I'll get some tickets when they're available!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gravity?
It was cool to watch in the theater on the big screen.
Yeah, I got it on Blu Ray and it's not really the same.
It's one of those movies that plays better in a huge theater with a good sound system.
Sandra Bullock did excellent though.
Yeah, made me like George Clooney better even though he died in it.
I also liked how it was relatively short.
Yeah, they didn't pad the length unnecessarily which a lot of movies do.
Tell you what, you buy a theater and I'll watch it with you.
Yeah, no problem.  Let me check my bank account.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the first Mission: Impossible movie?
The one with Tom Cruise in it?
Well, he's in all of them, but yes.
That was kind of before they decided to ruin it by making it a franchise.
He switched faces and disguises quite a bit in that movie.
That's what you do when you're a secret agent.
I kind of liked the twist at the end where he gave up his old boss.
He had to to try and clear their names.
Just thinking about the movie makes me want to rappel now.
Keep me out of the way of any cliffs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your thriller?
The Silence of the Lambs. It never gets old.
I love anthony hopkins performance.
Well Hannibal is such a great character to get to portray.
True, but his acting is superb.
I think jodie foster did a great job. Not as exciting or interesting a role though.
The buffalo Bill guy still freaks me out.
Itis just such a disturbing scenario.
That line, "It puts the lotion in the bucket" gives me shivers.
That is such a great creepy scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Argo?
Yes, good movie.
It has a crazy good cast with John Goodman, Afleck, and Bryan Cransten.
That's probably why it won best picture.
Yeah, and it won best screenplay too.
It was cool seeing how they had all those plans and get those six people out.
It was, sometimes these based on real events stories are just as thrilling as fiction.
I know, they say truth is stranger than fiction.
You know, Ben Afleck was good in that movie too
Yeah, he always is.  I don't know why he gets such a bad wrap.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have this really old thriller movie on my mind lately and I can't remember what it's called.
Do you remember what it was about?
Yeah, I remember there was this young girl and there was something about phone calls...
It wasn't When a Stranger Calls, was it?
No, I remember that one about the babysitter, but -- Oh, it was that she was making prank phone calls!
Okay...
But something went wrong. Somehow she found out that one of the people she called had really done something bad.
Oh, that sounds like I Saw What You Did!
That's it! I kept thinking it was something like, "I Know Who You Are" but when I searched online nothing came up.
That's because that's part of the line she used in the prank calls. I remember watching this movie growing up, how she'd say "I saw what you did, and I know who you are".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into thriller movies at all?
Kind of.
What have you seen recently?
I saw Man From Reno.
Oh who was in that?
Pepe Serna.
Sounds interesting.
It was.
Do you recommend?
Perhaps if you like thrillers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the last time you saw that movie Signs?
Man, a long time ago.  Why do you ask?
I was just thinking about it the other day.  I really hated the ending.
Which is sad because the rest of the movie is constructed pretty well.
Why on earth would the aliens come to a planet that's 75% water?
Because they are stupid.  That's the only logical reason.
My wife keeps cups of water lying around the house too like the little girl.
Is that due to laziness or aliens?
Both I think.  All I know is that I just keep dumping them out.
The aliens are gonna get you then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Taxi Driver was a great movie
Is that with Robert DeNiro?
Yes. Martin Scorses directed it.
When was it made?
In the 70's
Cool. Was it scary?
No. It was more of a psychological suspense flick
Excellent. I have never seen one like that
There are not many.
I like movies with a lot of violence and suspense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Blue Velvet.
That's a classic.  David Lynch?
Yes.
Who was the bad guy?
Dennis Hopper.
And the beautiful woman?
The great Isabella Rossellini.
Wow, anybody else?
Laura Dern.
Bruce's cute daughter!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am interested in some popular thrillers
Do you want some recommendations
Sure that would be nice
Well i got one it is about someone entering dreams and such
That sounds cool
Yeah it is pretty cool one of my favorites
What is it called
It is called inception
That sounds good is it old
Nah it is not to old it has ellen page in it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love conspiracy thrillers. They're my favorite kind of movie.
Did you see Operation Avalanche? It has guys from the CIA faking the moon landing in 1967.
Yeah, I streamed it. Wonderful special effects, though the acting wasn't always top notch.
It was good enoough for me. Did you see the Manchurian Candidate?
Yes, a true popcorn movie. The Manchurian Corporation brainwashes an entire platoon in Iraq to get their guy elected vice president.
They fail, of course.
Right. If they'd succeeded, nobody would dare to make a movie about it.
Or maybe they suceeded, and made the move to make us think they failed!
Only you would think that. What about the original version?
The Manchurian Frank Sinatra? I actually liked that one better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Nightcrawler?
I think so.
Jake Gylenhall is in it.
What's he do?
He films news events and sells them to stations.
Oh yeah. He is great.
I like how he learns to do it and succeeds.
Isn't he crazy?
Yes, he is a sociopath.
That's creepy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
Yes I do.
What is your favorite Thriller movie?
The Dark Knight.
Oh really?
Yeah.
That movie scared me a bit.
But I think Christian Bale is awesome.
I agree he is a good actor.
He should do more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
No Country for Old Men was a weird movie.
Weird?  Not the word I'd use.
Well, by that I mean it's creepy.  I'm not sure I get it.
You mean the ending where he's talking to his wife?
No, before that where the villain guy is talking to his wife.
Yeah, he flipped a quarter and killed her.
How do you know she's dead?
After he's done, he looks at this shoes.  That's a tell that there may have been blood on that.
I never noticed that.
You should watch it again to see what I mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe there are 5 bourne Identity movies?
No, I can't. I think I only saw the first one.
Really? I thought they were pretty. Matt Damon is great as Jason Bourne.
I think they have been received pretty well but after the first one, I'm just not in to that.
Did you do the 007 movies with Daniel Craig?
Now he does a great spy film. I think I've seen everyone of those.
I really liked Casino Royal.
Me too. I hope they do one more I've heard talks buzzing.
That would be cool. I like these spy movies with all the action and suspense.
Shocker, you love that stuff. The bigger you blow things up the better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How great is The Exorcist?
It is one of the best horror movies ever made
Is it really scary?
It is extremely scary and well made
I love horror thrillers
Me too
The way they build suspense is really good
Yeah. They did that great in the 70's
What part of The Exorcist is the most thrilling?
The end when Damien jumps out the window
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of any good thriller films coming out?
I know they are remaking the movie IT.
With the killer clown?
Yep, I bet it is scary.
The older one scared me so much.
In the scene with clown head in the fridge, they did not tell the actors, their reaction was real.
That is so scary! I hope it lives up to the old one.
Liam Neesan has one coming out around the same time.
What is it called?
The commuter, I bet it is scary, traveling always is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Psycho?
Oh yes, that's a classic thriller movie
Yeah, the shower scene is unforgettable
Yeah, my mom said when she saw it, she couldn't shower for weeks afterwards
Man, that's intense
Wasn't there a scene about a dead mother in that movie?
Yes, turns out he would dress up like his mother and kill his victims
Creepy.
Yeah and then he kept his mom's dead body in the basement
Even more creepy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the last good thriller movie you saw?
I watched the movie Se7en recently.
Oh yeah. Is that the one with Brad Pitt in it?
Yeah, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey are both in it.
Did you enjoy it? was it actually scary?
Yeah, it was a great movie. Has an epic twist at the end.
What's the movie about?
Two detectives are trying to find and solve a series of murders by a serial killer based on the seven deadly sins.
Oh man, that sounds like quite the thriller.
Yes, and it's very well done. I'd highly recommend it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Memento?
A few years ago.  Why do you ask?
I'm just a bit confused by it.
I think everyone was confused by it.  What part in particular?
The ending.  So the whole movie was really in reverse?
Kind of.  It kind of progressed and went backwards all at once.
I feel like I need some sort of graph or something showing what's happening and when.
I think it did make the film more interesting though.
True.  If it would have been chronological, wouldn't have had the same impact.
Exactly.  Was definitely an interesting experience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the 2000 thriller American Psycho will Christian Bale?
Yes, I actually really like that movie and find it quite entertaining.
It is a pretty amusing movie and I really thought the young Bale at that time did a great job.
Not only is it a thriller, there is also a fair amount of dark comedy.
Yes, that is also true. Especially the scene with Paul Allen, that is probably the most famous part of the movie.
Not only that, but the Patrick character was also very interesting.
That begs the question that has never been answered --- was it all in his head?
I have heard that rumor, but also read statements that while most of it in fact was in his head, not all of it.
That's another strong aspect of the movie. Letting the audience decide what really happened.
I agree. It's always good, because he we are almost twenty years later still talking about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that movie with Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis?
The one where he sees dead people?
Yeah, that one.
The 6th Sense, I think.
Oh, yeah, I don't know how I forgot that.
Did you like that one?
Yeah, I just haven't seen it in a while.
That was a big hit for that boy, right?
Oh, sure.  He probably made a ton.
I don't think he even acts anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite scary movie?
Whats that one with the doll that kills people?
Oh you mean Chucky?
Yeah! The newest movie came out not too long ago, I really liked that one.
Cool I'll check it out. Is it as funny as Bride of Chucky?
It's a lot more scarier than Bride of Chucky
Is it like the older movies in the series
Yeah, they really went back to their roots and turned up the scare factor
Is it better than the older movies?
I wouldn't say better, but it's just as fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of that new shark thriller film, 47 Meters Down?
I thought it was pretty awful. I almost couldn't sit through it. The only thing I liked was the ending.
Seriously? I thought it was great. What didn't you like about it?
The two girls squealing like bubbleheads the whole time drove me nuts. You'd think with that much air in their heads, they wouldn't have run out of oxygen.
You just made me laugh, you're funny. What did you like about the ending?
It was pretty much the only part of the film that was really emotional. Otherwise it was the kind of film where you end up rooting for the sharks.
You have to admit, it was tense and suspenseful.
Yes, that it was for sure! But if you want a better shark film, I'd recommend The Shallows.
With Blake Lively? I've been meaning to see that.
It's great, it's just her and the shark for most of the film, but she is intelligent, resourceful, and definitely not annoying!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have another Joan Crawford,Bette Davis thriller for you. How about Hush Hush,Sweet Charlotte.
Another great thriller.
Great cast in that movie.
All star cast. Joseph Cotton,Victor Buono and Olivia de Haviland.
How about Agnes Moorehead.
Right,Bewitched mother on tv.
Yes,and she won the academy award for best supporting actress.
That's right,she did.
That was out in 1964 I think.
Yes,you're right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that movie shutter island
I think i have
Did you enjoy it
I quite did
it is intense and a little creepy
I mean but are those bad things
Nah not at all
Well gotta keep an open mind
Sure thing
I got some other movies if you want
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally watched that thriller, Dark Swan.
What did you think of it?
It was much darker than I thought it would be.
Natalie Portman had such a great role in that film.
I loved that it made me wonder about her sanity.
I liked the way it twisted the genre around.
The ballet aspect was so poetic.
I think it was meant to sort of play the story out before the story did.
The title was fitting as well.
I wonder if she will do any more thrillers?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a fifteen year old granddaughter who won't watch Jurassic Park.
I kind of get that.
I know,it's scary.
It is a classic.
Yet another Steven Spielberg hit.
He's got a lot of them.
The movie won an Academy Award for special effects.
Well that makes sense.
Love Jeff Goldblum.
He was great in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any good movies lately?
Actually now that you say it yes I just watched Gone Girl
The one with Ben Affleck?
Yes, that movie was insane
Why?  What was it about?
Well the movie starts with Ben basically looking for his missing wife and it looks like she was murdered
does he end up finding her?
Yeah it takes awhile but he does find out she was faking the whole incidnet
Does he get revenge?
Yes him and another person that she screwed over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does The Dark Tower come out?
I don't know.
Have you seen the previews?
Yep. That movie looks hot.
How on earth did Idris Elba get to do a movie with Matt?
I don't know but I can't wait to see it.
I think it might be out later this summer.
I hope so. I haven't seen a good thriller in a while.
Well when it comes out do you want to go see it with me?
You but the tickets and I'll buy the refreshments.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of that movie with Nic Cage and John Travolta?
Face Off?
Yeah, that's it.
Why do you ask?
I was trying to find it on Netflix.
I haven't seen it in a while.
Did you like it?
I don't remember.  I mean I like Cage and Travolta, so I think I did.
I thought it was pretty good.
Well, let me know if it's still what you remembered.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Gone Girl?
Is that the thriller about the girl who gets kidnapped?
It is! It is based on a book.
That movie was so scary I heard. People felt that way because it seemed so real.
Neil Patrick Harris & Tyler Perry were particularly excellent in the film.
Ben Affleck was one of the stars too, right?
Yes, he was the leading man of the film and the one who is accused of kidnapping.
Did he actually kidnap her though?
It is more complicated than that.
I guess I will have to see it to find out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the John Wick movies?
I have seen both of them. Have you?
I saw the first one. I really like Keanu Reeves.
Me too. The second one also stars my favorite actress Ruby Rose.
She has been in a lot of movies lately. I like her too.
She has a pretty big role in the second John Wick.
Is she a good guy or a villain?
She plays a villain which is perfect for her. Can't tell you much else without giving away the movie.
She always plays such good villains. Please tell me if his new dog dies?
No, he the dog does not die in the new movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you interested in going to the movies this weekend?
Yeah! I heard there's a good one called Annabelle.
What's that about?
I think it's about a doll that comes to life and haunts some people.
I'm not really interested in movies about dolls.
Okay. Would you prefer to see Hostel?
Yeah, I would go watch that one. Which one?
I didn't know there was more than one.
Unfortunately. They should have stopped at the first movie.
Some horror movies just keep making them, even when they shouldn't. Just like Final Destination.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like foreign thriller movies?
I have not seen too many.
If you like thrillers, it is an nice niche of the genre to get into.
What would you say is best to start with.
I would go with a newer one, like Hunt.
Is it hard to follow?
No, you can get English subtitles.
Does that take away from any of the thrill?
No. It makes it a bit more scary, adds some mystery.
I will have to start looking into them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about the Psycho movies there are lot's of them that have been remade since the first old original one from the 1960's.
Wow so you mean to tell me you saw that movie Psycho too what year of the Psycho Thriller did you see?
I saw the Thriller movie from 1998 starring that Psycho maniac guy Norman.That guy was really mental.
Yeah he sure was there was a hotel that was owned by his mother who he seemed to be very close to.But one day his Mom Died and he began reacting mentally ill.
Yes he wouldn't bury his mother he left her body hidden inside the house behind the hotel. This was insane.
I know when the customer's would go and rent a room they would start disappearing one woman named Marion who stole her bosses money tried to get away with stealing it.
And Norman got in the way of that and while she was showering he brutally murdered Marion. I know because i saw this one.
Well anyway after that the sister and her boyfriend had been looking for Marion. but Norman kept lying saying he seen her and she left the hotel.
Meanwhile the sister and boyfriend was still searching around for Marion and they were curious about that house in the back of that hotel.
Norman had pushed the body into the lake when they found out the sister was murdered they had Norman arrested and inside the jail he sat there thinking talking and sounding just like his mom with that insanity. And the police informed he was mentally ill. Cool Thriller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We should see a new movie.  Any good ones at the theatre?
There is a new shark movie called 47 meters I think?
Oh yeah, like the next jaws movie.
I haven't read any reviews about it but it's a refreshing change from what's out now.
Yes I remember there was out called Deep Blue.  Didn't care much for it.
No it didn't do well at all.
I wonder if it will be as good as jaws?
I would love to see a remake of the original jaws.
That would be awesome.
Can you imagine what they could do with todays CGI technology?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Rear Window last night.
The original or the reboot?
The original.  Nobody beats Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart.
Not to mention Thelma Ritter.  She was a riot.
I liked Raymond Burr as the heavy.
Wendell Corey was ok.
I liked the Hitchcock cameo.
Yes, winding up the clock.
The ending was pretty cool.
And Jimmy gets the girl!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Professional?
Yes I did, with Natalie Portman.
Yeah, people forget about that movie.  It was pretty good.
Yeah, it was cool.  That French guy was an assassin but still had a heart of gold.
Kind of an odd thing to say but true.  They had a good almost parent child relationship.
Yeah, and in the end he sacrifices his life for her.
She grew up to be a really good actress.
She did.  And basically I've had a crush on her my whole life.
You too?  I thought that was only me.
One of the benefits of being the same age as her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen national treaure?
Who is in it?
Nicolas cage
Yes i really liked it
Me too, it was really suspenseful
And you learn stuff you didnt know before
I wonder if any of it is true
Im sure it is
Your probably right
Thank you
XXXXXXXXXXX
I had never noticed how many thriller movies the guy from Broke Back mountain has been in.
Which guy from that movie?
Jake Gyllenhaal.
He had one last year, with Amy Adams.
Nocturnal Animals, I think it was called.
Yes, did you see it?
I have not got around to seeing it. You?
Yep, it is a classic type thriller.
In what way?
The movie feed you bits of info, while keeping you on the edge of your seat. Guessing the motive and ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So tell me what kind of movies you like.
Nothing can beat a good thriller.
I agree, do you know of any good ones?
Do you enjoy Bruce Willis movies?
Yes, I think he is very talented.
I recently watched a movie called Striking Distance that was really good.
I do not think I have seen that one. Who is in it with him?
Sarah Jessica Parker is also in it.
Does it keep you on the edge of your seat?
Yes! It certainly does that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Saw?
Yes, that was an awesome movie.  Had me guessing the whole time.
Every-time I see it, those games he has everyone play.  Kill or be killed basically.
But the best part was at the end.
When he finally caught the killer.  I was surprised to see he was playing the game as well.
I would have never thought it.  And when he cut his own limb off.
That was gross and shocking.
But the biggest surprise came at the end.
Turns out Saw was the guy on the floor.
That was one of the most suspensful movies I've ever scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm in the mood for a good thriller movie. Have you seen any lately?
I actually haven't seen any lately, but a few I've seen in the past and liked are Gone Girl, Silence of the Lambs, The Sixth Sense, and Memento.
I've seen all of those except Memento. Is it worth watching?
Definitely. It's really original and keeps you guessing.
I've heard of it but can't remember who's in it.
Guy Pearce, who's very good in it, Joe Pantoliano, and Carrie Ann Moss.
I like Guy. He was in a couple of the Alien movies.
Yep, that's him. It's good in a way that you didn't see it in the theater because it's a little hard to follow in spots, and if you watch it on DVD or online, you'll be able to rewind and watch parts of it over again.
Great, sounds intriging.
I remember when I saw it I was very impressed with the uniqueness of it and I really like the story. It's also filmed in a unique way, but I don't want to give too much away!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last Thriller movie you seen?
I just watched Don't Breath the other night.
I don't think I have seen that one.
You should. It had me on the seat of my pants the entire time.
What was it about?
Basically about some young adults who break into a blind man's house, but don't expect what happens next.
How was the acting?
It was amazing. A ton of young actors that were able to carry the movie
How were the jump scares?
The sound and just the entire premise added to the suspense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to see Black Swan?
I've seen it a couple of times actually. It was great.
Natalie Portman was amazing in that movie.
She really became the swan, literally and figuratively.
The director's cinematography was fantastic as well.
It really surprised me the scene between her and Mila Kunis though.
Oh I'm sure no one was expecting that, it was a shocker.
But there were a lot of people who enjoyed it though.
That's for sure. I like that Winona Ryder made an appearance too.
That's true, it's been so long since we've seen her in anything worthwhile.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie gone girl?
Yes, what did you think?
I am torn, I think I prefer the book.
I enjoyed both. I think they both were suspenseful.
Yes, I felt both were overhyped though.
Gone girl was a hugely popular in general.
I actually think Dark Places by the same author was a better book and movie.
It did not get the same attention which is too bad because it was good.
Yes chloe grace mortez was really great in that role.
I really liked the actor who played the young Trey Teepano.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any thriller movies about dinosaurs?
Yeah, I just watched Jurassic Park for like the 500th time.
I love that movie! It's intense.
It definitely is. Do you remember the part where the T-Rex eats the guy who was in the bathroom?
Yeah, that was awesome. But my favorite part is when the Velociraptors are chasing people around in buildings.
That part was tense. I thought for sure they would kill all those people.
It would be so scary to be in that situation.
I think its pretty odd they didn't have a bunch of guns around.
Me too, considering they were surrounded by dangerous dinosaurs.
I'm gonna have to watch that movie again, I'm excited just thinking about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a suspenseful thriller movie to watch?
How about Face Off? That's a good one.
Oh yeah, it was action packed from beginning to end!
I know! John Travolta and Nicolas Cage really know how to play off each other;
I know, right?
Nicolas Cage is a great bad guy.
He is! He's so intense.
That's it. His eyes seem like they're reading your mind.
When him and John switched faces. It was. so gross!
Ugh, that gave me the creeps just thinking ano
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the last movie that made you jump ?
that  would be  bye bye man
Who is the villian in that one ?
He's kind of  a shadow man that  causes  fear .
Are there  alot  of   deaths ?
The  are  a  few  gruesome  ones in this one .
What other movie is  it  similar  to ?
I would  compare it  to  the first  final destiantion .
Does it have room for  a part  two ?
It does  leave it open for  a  sequel  or  a  prequel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude I cannot get over the movie Split. I watched it like 3 days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it.
Split? That's the movie with Brad William Henke as the guy with 24 different personalities correct?
Yes! Like jesus!! I haven't watched an intense movie like this in a long time. Words really cannot describe how I feel about it.
I saw it when it came out in theaters, and had the same reaction you're having now, lasted like 3 weeks for me. It was actually pretty scary.
Those poors girls! I was rooting for them the entire time, I never really lost hope that they wouldn't escape that house until Henke turned into the beast and ate the two girls.
Haha! Omg man, I thought he was full of it until he literally crushed his doctor lady with his bare hands.
Exactly! But the fact he spared the last girls life was so satisfying, the emotional rollercoaster of those last 20 minutes almost gave me a heart attack.
More like the last 5 minutes for me, did you even see Bruce Willis sitting the cafe?!?! Like What!
You really think I missed that part? I've been reading up the final scene since the movie ended. Word of mouth is that M Night Shyamalan is going to make the sequal to Unbreakbale with the premisis from Split.
I'll believe it when I see it but how epic would that be? M Night Shyamalan is making a serious comeback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Cape Fear last night.
The old one or the remake?
Original.
Cool.  Who was the bad guy?
Robert Mitchum.
And the hero?
Gregory Peck.
What was your favorite scene?
When Mitchum pops an egg in the houseboat.
I might watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What's happening
Not much.
Do you like thriller movies?
What makes a movie a thriller?
It's got some drama, some action, usually pretty tense.
Okay that sounds like a good description.  Do you like those?
Yeah I would say that is probably one of my most favorite genres.
Oh cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new movie Baby Driver?
No. I have never heard of it what is it about?
A tinnitus-suffering getaway driver who uses his headphones to drown out the ringing, and jobs for a mob boss to pay for petrol.
Sounds pretty interesting.
It is there is alot of cool actors also
Who are they?
Ansel Elgor is one of the near mute actors.
I am not sure who that is.
Jamie Foxx is a co star.
I like him, he cracks me up!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Probably, Snake Eyes, with Nicholas Cage.
Is that the one about the boxing match in Atlantic City?
Yeah that's it. Nicholas Cage plays a corrupt Atlantic City cop and he gets caught up in an assassination.
I like Nicholas Cage a lot. He's been in a lot of thrillers.
Have you seen him in 8mm?
Yes, that movie was super creepy.
I think so too. I definitely didn't see that ending coming!
I know, he made it really believable too!
Nicholas Cage is just a great actor. He's so intense, he really draws you in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so bored right now!
Me to, how about we watch a movie?
That could be fun, do you have any thrillers?
I sure do!! Have you seen Kiss The Girls?
Sounds familiar, who is in it?
It stars Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.
I have wanted to watch that one for a while now!
It is a great thriller that will keep you guessing.
I started to watch it a long time ago but something came up.
I can not wait to see what you think about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, can you recommend any good thriller movies?
Well, I really liked Shutter Island, have you seen that one?
Yeah, I did!  I've read the book too!  I thought they did a great job translating it to screen.
Yeah, me too!  I thought DiCaprio gave a really good performance in it.
And of course, Scorsese always bring a real unique vision to his work.
Yeah, I heard a neat theory about the ending as well.  You know how they told DiCaprio's character that if this doesn't work they're going to have lobotomize him?
Yeah, and he regresses right back to his delusional self and they take him away at the end?
Yeah before he goes he says something like, "Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"
Yeah, I remember that.  What did you hear about that?
Well, I think Leo's character DIDN'T relapse.  That he just couldn't live with the guilt of killing his wife, so he decided he'd rather get lobotomized than deal with that pain, and that's his way of letting the other guy know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen both Prisoners and the prestige?
Yes, both are great thrillers with Hugh Jackman.
That brings me to my question, which is a better performance by him?
Hard call. he is so great in both.
But if you had to pick.
I think prisoners because it is such a dark role. I think it took a lot.
I think he may have more screen time in prisoners , but not really sure.
Like I said hard call overall. I enjoy both films and both of his performances.
I think I would rather rewatch prestige to prisoners.
I think it makes for a more enjoyable rewatch once you know the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of a thriller staring Andy Griffith?
I think so.
What was the name of it?
Grampa? No, it was Gramps.  John Ritter was in it too,
And Griffith was playing a sociopath?
Yeah. It was a pretty decent movie as I recall.
Oh wow. My dad told me about it, but I couldn't believe him.
Why not?
I never would have expected Andy Griffith playing a crazy old man
The movie was made around 1995. You should check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite Denis Villeneuve movie?
I would pick prisoners or arrival.
Good choices. I think prisoners was very dark.
It is a dark movie. It had me biting my nails almost the whole time.
Hugh Jackman had so much intensity in his performance. It was crazy!
Jackman was good, but I  actually found Jake Gyllenhaal's performance even better.
Jake Gyllenhaal was more out of his typical role or rather look in this film.
Really ever since donnie darko I think of him in a kind of darker movie world.
I guess I see jake as more of a young boy or had until this film.
Here he is  in a role as an adult profession.. police officer/detective. Change from teenage roles like donnie darko.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally saw North by Northwest in my film class.
That's a classic by Hitchcock.  What did you think?
It was an interesting film.  Not sure I liked Cary Grant in it.
What was your favorite scene?
I thought the field scene was awesome.
Was that where they are in the corn?
Right, where the plane is chasing him around.
Yeah, that's an iconic film moment and staged very well.
Well, Hitchcock is the master of suspense.
That he was for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Crash?
No but I have heard of it.
It won a lot of awards.
Oh so I should watch it?
Yes you absolutely should.
What is it about?
It is about the seven degrees of separation.
How people are connected?
Yes pretty much, there are great dramatic scenes from many peoples lives in this film.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished watching the movie Split.
Oh my god that is one of my favorite movies to come out in 2016.
I know, James McAvoy nailed the role down perfectly.
Which was hard to do considering he had about 23 different personalities.
They way he slipped in and out of character was super creepy.
Yeah especially when he became the young boy.
Did you catch the surprise ending?
Seeing Bruce Willis as David Dunn literally blew my mind.
I felt the same way, it made me reevaluate and look at the movie from a whole other perspective.
I guess this means we will be seeing a Unbreakable 2 movie in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movie Alien?
Yes,a long time ago.
It came out in 1979.
Wow,I didn't knew it was that long ago.
Loved Sigourney Weaver in it.
Yes,she was great.
How about John Hurt?
Yes and Tom Skerritt.
They were all good.
It was just a really good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Saw movies?
Yes, I love them! I've seen all of them.
Me too! Which one is your favorite?
Not to be cliche, but I love the first one.
I mean, it did start the whole franchaise.
Basically, I love the fact it's in one room.
Me too, I think that really changed the movie game.
That was one of the first times a movie in one room was recieved that well.
Well, the first one is definetely good.
Amen to that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I see Netflix has added a couple of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies.
I'm really glad, I think it's past due.
Are you a fan?
I am, I'm a big fan especially of the first one. It's kind of nostalgic for me cause I remember watching it as a young kid and being enthralled, even though I had recurring nightmares about Freddy Kreuger.
That's kind of ironic. And I'm surprised your parents let you watch it.
Yeah, I remember seeing it at like 7 years old! I'm surprised cause I didn't remember the nudity and other stuff that was in it until I rewatched it again recently.
"other stuff" like Robert Englund.
He did a fantastic job portraying Freddy!
Hence giving you nightmares.
Yeah, but I forgive him. I'm really glad he, Heather Langenkamp and Wes Craven got to come back and play themselves in New Nightmare.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who directed that movie The Killing?
That was Stanley Kubrick
Wow. It is really good.
Yes. The end where the money flies out of the suitcase is intense.
I agree. I felt bad for Sterling Hayden's character.
That movie was unlike any other for that time.
Yeah. The shots were good and the suspense was great
Did it come out in the 60's?
No, the 50's
The 50's had some good thrillers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Insomnia?
Awesome movie.  Makes me want to visit Alaska.
That would be nuts to have that much daylight in a given day.
What I really appreciated was Robin Williams in the film.
It was weird to see him as a villain.  I think of him as Mrs. Doubtfire.
It was kind of cool to see him in a different role though.
It was a good ending though.
Yeah, sad, but was the appropriate one.
Christopher Nolan hasn't made a bad movie yet.
And this definitely isn't one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Hitchcock movie?
The Birds
I love that one
Me too. Did you know there was no music in it?
I had no idea
It was so scary. I had no idea why the birds did that.
I like how they left it a mystery.
Hitchcock does that in all of his films.
What is your favorite part of The Birds?
I like every scene equally. They are all great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Saw?
No I missed that?
Did you see any of the sequels?
No I did not.
The first one is the best.
You liked it?
Yes it is a super thriller.
Ok that sounds fun.
Yes it is so thrilling to watch that interesting and unique movie.
Ok I will watch it, thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Imitation Game?
That was pretty good.
Yeah Benedict Cumberbatch was amazing in it.
I agree.  Plus it was different to see a non action based side of World War 2 movies but still thrilling and nail biting.
It was.  A little eye opening to see how bad gays were treated not all that long ago.
I know right?  After he basically saved millions on both sides.
That is true.  How about how he schooled everyone in the beginning?
Yeah it was good.  And how he built that machine and somehow held on.
Yeah, they wanted to destroy it.
Good thing they didn't.  Or else he would have never broken the code.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So Joe, did you ever see the first film Clint Eastwood directed, Play Misty for Me?
Yes I did. It's a strange one for a thriller, but it does draw you in.
It's not that strange, it's a psychological thriller, like Shutter Island or Silence of the Lambs.
In this case, Marsha, it's the deranged fan who needs psychological help. She's sooo demented.
But the hero wasn't thinking straight either. Why did he sleep with her if he didn't want her around?
Do I really have to explain that to you?
Uh, no, thanks, but remember Fatal Attraction? Straying is dangerous in movies, and in real life, too, believe me.
So the movie really doesn't have a hero. He's not heroic, for sure.
Well he does try to let her down gently.
Yeah, but she ends up taking a hard fall. Of course, it could just as easily have been him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You an old movie that still gets me
What movie is that
The sixth sense
That one still gets me too
I know it is good but confusing
It is also thrilling and creepy
All around a decent mix i suppose
I still have not seen another movie similar
Same here
I want to watch it again now
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that movie called Seven with Brad Pitt?
Wasn't Morgan Freedman in that?
Yeah, he was one of the cops. And Kevin Spacey was in it too.
Wasn't he the big bad?
Yeah, he makes a great bad guy.
I think Gwynneth Paltrow was in it too. I only remember she was Brad Pitt's girlfriend and they had a Weimaraner.
Isn't that a dog?
Yeah, but he didn't have big part. It was a good thriller movie.
I remember there was a lot of suspense.
I was kind of shocked at the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen any of the Psycho movies?
I've seen some.  I don't know if I've seen all of them.
Did you know that they turned the movies into a series?
No.  Did they?
Yeah, it lasted a few seasons, but it just ended.
Oh, what was the name of it?
It was called Bates Motel.
It follows the same story line?
Actually, it shows why Normal turned into a crazy person.
Oh, that sounds interesting!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about The Bourne Identity?
Probably one of my all time favorite movies.
I love Matt Damon
I saw the behind the scenes of how they make it, and they put a lot of detail into those fight scenes
The whole trilogy was good, but then it started to go downhill a bit when they introducted jeremy renner.
Yea, the bourne legacy was a bit weird.
And the newest Bourne Film was a bit lackluster too unfortunatly
I agree, the original 3 films were so good, that my expectations were probably just too high.
Here's hoping they can figure out a way to get that quality back.
I'm sure they will focus on a good story like the original
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies?
Yes! Do you?
They are the best genre.
I wish they would remake some more Hitchcock films.
Something like the Birds.
That movie made me so afraid of birds, for years.
All of his movies played so well into human fear.
I like the way the suspense seemed so real.
Yep, like the plot could happen to any one.
I think that is what made all of his movies so thrilling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the thriller Misery before?
When did it come out?
It is a Stephen King thriller from 1990.  I watched it on tv the other day.
Who plays in it?
James Caan and Kathy Bates plays in it.
Is that the one where James Cann's character gets trapped by a crazy woman in a cabin?
Yes, she is nuts, and even breaks his legs to keep him from leaving!
Wow! I think I saw it a while back but it's been so long.
I enjoyed watching  her get what she deserved.
Good!  I am glad of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a fan of the Jaws movies?
Now I am!
Did you used to not be?
Well, once when I was young, my friend and I watched it and I cried.
Yeah, it could be scary for a kid.
I was terrified!
Did it make you scared to go into the water?
I never really liked going into the water, but that didn't help.
Do you think they should remake it?
I don't know.  I'd probably see it though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like old thriller movies?
Yeah I do, like "Night of the Living dead"?
Yeah! That was the first  zombie movie.
Yeah, it was creepy, seeing all those zombies.
The movie is in black and white, which make it more scary.
I like the zombie movie called"The Crazies".
Yeah, I saw that one too, this was a 1970 movie.
I am going to the movies to see "The Puppet Master" it is a remake of the original.
I saw "The Puppet Master" 1,2,3 they were scary to watch.
The "Puppet Master is about all those little dolls coming to life, it is a fun movie to see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have gotten really into like period piece thrillers.
Set in olden times?
Yes. Like the Prestige.
With Christian Bale?
Yes, and the magic and mystery.
I like when Hugh Jackman is trying to keep up with his rival.
When Alfred Borden seems to make himself teleport?
Yes. But there was a twist.
He had a secret twin!
But Angier did not know, and ended up making weird clones of himself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen project almanac?
Yes it was wierd
And a perfect reason of why you dont mess with time travel
Exactly
It has been a while since ive seen it
Me too
Im suprised they didnt come out with a sequel to it
Me too
They like their sequels these days
They do
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hello.
Do you like thriller movies?
Yeah sure.
What about thrillers do you like?
I like the sense of tenseness and excitement.
That is a big part of their appeal yeah.
Do you like them?
Yeah I enjoy thrillers.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Vertigo the other night.
Not my favorite Hitchcock, but good.
I liked the story line.
Kim Novak was so pretty.
Barbara Bel Geddes had a fun comic role.
She was pretty cool.
I liked the scene where Kim Novak jumps into the water.
It was shocking.
The tower scene was very scary.
A dramatic ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen next?
Who is in it?
Jessica biel and nicolas cage
Yes i think i have
Its really good
I think i liked it
Its the one he can see into the future
Oh yea and at the end of the movie he saw the whole thing and it hasnt happened yet
It was freaky
Definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Today I saw the movie "Insidious" it was really scary., have you seen that movie?
Not yet, Is that the movie about a ghost bothering this  family?
Yes, it was a scary movie, part 2 is coming to theaters soon?
Is part 2 scary too?
Yes, it looks like it is going to really scary too, Did you see the movie called"Uninvited"?
Yes, great movie, the ending was very shocking.
I saw the movie 2 times.
I think it the movie "Uninvited" came on a cable TV channel recently, it is still a great movie to watch.
Did you like the part at the end of the movie when the girl surprised her father with what she did?
Yes, I did, the movie was very shocking at the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Identity was on T.V. last night.
What's that?
A movie. Didn't you ever see it?
I don't think so.
John Cusack and Ray Liotta are in it.
No, then I never saw a movie with the two together.
Great film. Look for it.
Is it a thriller or action?
More of a thriller. Really has a twist to it.
Well you got me interested in it. I'll watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller Movies?
Yes I do.
Which ones?
I like the Matrix.
Oh that is cool. I don't like the first one.
The first one is the best. Which do you like?
I like Reloaded.
That is also a good movie though.
I wish they came out with more.
Same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like thrillers that have a political angle. Things like All The President's Men or Blow Out. Some older ones, but still good.
Yeah, political can be good. Even something like WarGames, the old one with Matthew Broderick, could be considered political.
Oh sure. After all, it was about nuclear war. That's pretty political.
I also really like thriller movies that are reality-based. Stuff like Erin Brockovich starring Julia Roberts, which was based on a true story.
Oh, she was so good in that. Good example of a movie that could have been boring but was actually great.
Very true. Oh, another good example of an old one that still stands up: The China Syndrome.
Yeah, that was from the seventies, wasn't it? That movie scared the heck out of me.
Yet, 1979, I think. Scared me, too.
Did you ever see The Fugitive? That's a thriller, isn't it?
I think so. An action thriller, at least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Fight Club was a trip, wasn't it?
One of the great endings every in my opinion.
Are you talking about the buildings blowing up?
No, I mean the split personality thing.
Gotcha.  Weird how he could shoot himself in the head and not die.
Guess he had the right angle on the bullet path.
I loved how they teased little hints throughout how Brad Pitt wasn't real.
Catch it and you missed it.  It was only in a few frames.
Can't believe it came out so long ago!
And still holds up very well throughout time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey lets go and see a movie this week
What do you want to go and see?
I think I would like to go see that new movie King Arthur
You sure you don't want to go see 47 meters down?
Is that the one with the Sharks?
Yes, It looks like something that would have you on the edge of your seat the entire time
Okay lets go see that one I love a good shark attack movie
Right, I loved Jaws
Best Shark movie ever!
Even Jaws 2 and 3 were really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Others?
I don't know.  Who was in it?
It had Nicole Kidman.
What was it about?
A woman and her kids are stuck in a house.
That doesn't sound exciting.
Well, the house is kind of haunted.
Oh, well that's different.
Yeah, and the kids can't leave the house because they are sensitive to light.
I see.  So, the whole movie takes place in the house.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about Thriller movies.
Have you seen the new Spiderman movie?
The one with Andrew Garfield?
Yes.
Oh no not yet.
I loved it!
Really? I thought you were not into those kinds of movies.
I normally am not but for this movie it was just fantastic.
Oh that is wonderful.
I recommend it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go see the Mummy soon.
You mean the new movie with Tom Cruise in it?
Yes, it came out recently, and I heard it was pretty good.  I love the special effect looks.
That mummy's eyes are crazy with so many eyes in it!
Oh I know! I love thrillers m and this one looks so fun! I think the movie theater has it playing tomorrow at 5pm.
Who plays the Mummy?
Sofia Boutella plays the mummy, and does a great job from what I have heard.
Would you like me to go with you tomorrow?
Yes, that would be fun!
Ok, I will pick you up after work!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey John, have you ever gotten to see the movie Seven with Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in it?
No, I have not. What was it like?
It is very scary and thrilling.  The detectives try to find a serial killer before he strikes again.
I have seen things on it, but never took the time to watch it yet.
Gwyneth Paltrow plays the wife of Brad Pitt, and it really is sad the whole movie is well done.
That's right, I heard she played in that, now I really want to see it.  I hope I can see it on Netflix.
You can view it on Demand on cable if you want.
I will look for it.  Did you watch it on Showtime?
Yes, I did. Try it there.
Ok, thanks, I will check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recall that movie with Drew Barrymore from the 80's where she is telekenetic?
I Think that the movie is called "Firestarter" what about it?
I was just trying to remember some of the better thrillers from when I was a kid
That definitely was a great movie but I would say that the book was far better
Really?  it was a book?
Yes by Stephen King, he also wrote Cujo and Carrie
No Kidding?  man those movies were great also
Dont forget the other classic Pet Semetary
That one was super creepy
I still don't have a cat because of that movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what is your favorite Thriller movie?
Probably The Devils Advocate
That movie is Awesome!
Yea I love it!
Al Paccino was great in it!
I know!  What ever happened to that guy?
I don't know.  You don't see much of him any more
I know, right?
He's probably just very old and retired
Yea, you never know with old actors tho
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any new thriller movies lately?
I have! I saw 47 Meters Down.
What did you think?
It was very interesting.  But I will say that it didn't make me jump off my seat.
Typical shark movie?
Just a little bit! Mandy Moore did great but the story line was just a little off.
What makes you say that?
For once, who would want to go to shark-infested waters when you're on vacation? I could be sipping on martinis on the beach all day.
I'm on your boat all the way.
I don't know, I just didn't really like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies that are based on novels.
I do not read much, so I do not really know?
There are some really well known ones.
Like what movies?
Well, Gone Girl and Jaws are some that come to mind.
Jaws, with the shark, was based on a book?
Yep and it is one of the most well known thrillers.
I loved when they said the line, " We are going to need a bigger boat".
I liked how I never really knew what was going to happen.
The show kept you on your toes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that teen movie that came out earlier?
That's a horrible description for me to help you.
Never mind, I remember the name: Before I Fall.
Eh, thought it was disposable.  They just belabored the point.
In terms of continually reliving the same day.
Yeah.  I knew she would die no matter what.
Right, just had to set some other things on the right page before she did.
Completely predictable.  These movies take themselves too seriously.
Plus the performances were really wooden.
Definitely one to watch once and never return to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Gone Girl?
I did.  It was okay, I guess.
You guess?  Don't sound like a huge fan.
I'm not really.  I just thought it was okay.
What did you like and dislike?
I thought the pacing was well-done as well as the general plot twist.
It was quite interesting how the story was written.
Right, the changing perspective.
In the end, they are both reprehensible characters in my opinion.
Absolutely.  Just like real life sometimes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen memento?
Great film, what are your thoughts?
I thought it was a very ingenious film. I though the way they dealt with the timeline so interesting.
It was and at the time very original and new.
Guy Pearce also was great in this film. He really made it  work for me.
Guy Pearce was definitely showing his star power in this role. So good.
Joe Pantoliano is also a great character in this film, he is such a good bad guy.
Agreed he is also great in the matrix.
Yes I also enjoyed the matrix and his performance in it as well as the fugitive and others.
He is a good actor, less of a home known name but such a recognizable face.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's difficult for me to pin down a definition of what a thriller movie is.
Isn't it just a movie with a lot of suspense?
Maybe, but that can mean a lot of different things tonally.
Isn't suspense a tone?
Yes, but that's not what I mean. Like, Home Alone has a lot of suspense, so is it a thriller?
That's really a comedy though.
Some thrillers are also comedies though! The lines are really blurry.
Okay, then let's say Home Alone is a thriller then. What difference does it make?
Not a whole lot, I guess.
Exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wanted to watch something good and scary, but not gore focused.
You could watch something based on Stephen King's work.
Oh! Good idea! Which one?
You could watch Carrie. It is more of a thriller than a true horror.
That sounds like a good one. Who made that one?
Brian De Palma directed Carrie.
Great. I love his work that I've seen before.
Carrie also has some spectacular editing. You're in for a treat with the ending of that film!
I really appreciate the recommendation. I'd love to see that one on the big screen.
Yeah, I know. That finale would be breathtaking in a theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Book of Henry after all, like you wanted to?
Yeah, I saw it a couple of weeks ago.
Was it as suspenseful as the trailers made it out to be?
No, not at all. It was a kind of confusing movie.
What do you mean?
It wasn't like a straight up thriller like I thought.
What was it then?
Kind of a mix of black comedy, emotional, and a thriller.
Well that sounds weird!
That pretty much sums up the movie. Weird!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Ratter?
Oh man, that movie freaked me out.
Yea me too. It made me never want to be alone again.
Yea, it was like she couldn't trust anybody.
I know, and her poor mom.
Yea the mom part was the worst.
Can you image having to watch your daughter get attacked on skype?
No, I really can't.
She really should have just moved way earlier.
Yea, I really kind of wish we could see what happened after the ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to have a girl's night and watch some movies?
Yes, that sounds like a lot of fun!
Great, do you have any good thrillers that you could bring?
Have you ever seen The Client?
I am not sure, who is in it?
It stars Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon.
What is it about? It is a thriller, right?
Yes it is a very tense movie. It is about a boy who accidentally witnessed a murder.
Sounds like we should watch it!
Great, I hope everyone enjoys it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think of that 'Primal Fear' movie we saw last night?
I thought it was creepy and depressing.
You didn't enjoy it at all?
No, I enjoyed it, but I saw it ending differently in my head.
Yes, Edward Norton really played a deranged character.
It just made me feel bad to know that I pulled for him the whole movie, and then he let me down.
I think Richard Gere was kind of boring in it too.
Yeah, he didn't have a lot of excitement, but I think it was just because Edward Norton stole the show.
It definitely was a good movie though.
I agree with you, but I just wish it had a happier resolution.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Seen any decent thriller movies lately?
Yeah I've see a few I think.
Did you see them on tv or in theaters?
I saw them on tv through a streaming service.
Oh like netflix?
Yeah netflix hulu those kinds of things.
I don't have any of those.
You should if you like tv or movies.  They're great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you ever seen The Talented Mr. Ripley?
No why?
It's a really great thriller. It came out a while ago but it's a great movie.
Is it scary?
No but it's very intriguing.
What's it about?
A con artist who sort of infiltrates a group of rich young adults.
Is there a lot of gore?
No, not at all.  There's one scene with a bit of blood but nothing too bad.
Okay, great, I'll check it out.  Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any thriller movies you like lately?
Shudder Island, just saw it.
With Leonardo Dicaprio?
Yes, it is sort of set in the 1930's.
He is in like a mental institution right?
Yep, he spends most his time thinking he is a detective.
But there is a twist?
Yep, he is actually a patient.
I remember seeing that and being so freaked out.
It is really a suspenseful movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Open Water?
Yea! That movie freaked me out.
Me too! It was based on a true story.
Yea, but didn't they survive in real life?
I'm not sure. At least one of them did.
Still, That's crazy to get left out in shark infested water like that.
I know, I didn't blame the girl for giving up at the end.
I would have done it much sooner.
Could you imagine being out in the Ocean at night all alone, just waiting to get eaten?
No, that's literally my worst nightmare.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies?
No, what's that?
It's the kind of movie that usually have elements of suspense in it, and plays with characters with psychological instability.
Oh I remember my cousin mentioned Blair Witch Project. Does that count?
I guess so. That's an old one though, but very famous.
My cousin got so scared that he wanted to sleep in my room.
Funny, how old was he?
Sixteen. He got so scared that he avoids the garage at night.
Poor boy.
I don't think I would want to feel like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Conjuring?
It doesn't sound familiar. What's it about?
Well it's a paranormal thriller that takes place at some family's farmhouse and the characters are based on real people, The Warrens.
Ed and Lorraine Warren?
Yeah!
Oh I've heard of them, and seen some other thriller type stuff based on their work.
So it sound like something you'd be interested in?
Definitely, I've liked the other stuff I've seen and thriller is one of my favourite genres.
Well then you should like this. I like how it's not your typical thriller in that it takes you almost out of the story and references filming.
Almost like breaking the fourth wall.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
That is a tough one! I would narrow it down to either The Sixth Sense or National Treasure.
Interesting choices. Why do you choose The Sixth Sense?
I love that movie! Bruce Willis was amazing as the shrink. I never caught onto the fact that he was dead. It shocked me!
It shocked me too! What a good thriller.
Absolutely. National Treasure is a great thriller as well.
True. I that movie does always get my heart rate up.
I know! Watching them as they are being chased throughout America's most historic landmarks gets me so nervous!
I agree. They are constantly trying to outrun criminals, police, and time in that movie.
It is exhilarating to watch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever scene the original Alien?
That was good.  All of them have been good.
The best part though was the chest buster scene.
Yeah, because no one expected it at the time.
It was great to see such a strong female hero in the 80's as well.
Yes Segordney Weiver did a great job.
The alien is creepy the way it moves around too.
Almost unbeatable.
All the movies were great.
Except Alien vs Preditor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you consider a thriller?
Any mystery.
What about Sherlock?
Which Sherlock?  The ones with Robert Downey, Jr., yes. The ones with Basil Rathobone, no.
What about Death on the Nile?
No, too slow moving.  But I think that most Hitchcock movies are thrillers.
Except Pyscho.  That's a horror movie.
The Birds is a horror movie too.
And the Trouble with Harry is a dark comedy.
But, I think Supspiscion is a great thriller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is nothing good on television tonight!
I know, we could just find a movie to watch.
I want to watch some kind of a thriller!
Have you seen What Lies Beneath?
Is that the one with Harrison Ford in it?
Yea he stars in it with Michelle Pfieffer.
What is it about exactly?
I won't give away to much, but let's just say you will not see the ending coming.
Well I am ready to watch it now!
Great, I think you will really enjoy it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Just saw fight club, he was the guy the whole time!
Fight club kept me guessing.
It was like a thriller and a psychological thriller all at once.
It was a big film, but we are not supposed to talk about it.
What? Oh, the line in the film "Don't talk about fight club".
He was Tyler Durdan the whole time!
Yep. If you re-watch it, you will see no one speaks to both of them at the same time.
I had not even noticed.
I like the way it slowly let you in on him being Tyle.
Like when he goes looking for him, and the bar tender winks at him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the New Wolverine movie?
What is it called?
It called Logan.
Oh no but I want to.
It is really excellent.
Ok now I want to see it.
There are some really great scenes in that movie.
Wow that is somewhat surprising they can make a sequel that great.
It is one of the best sequels of all time.
Wow thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Kevin Bacon movies?
Love his movies.
How about Friday The Thirteenth?
That was a scary movie.
You know there is a Crystal Lake near me?
What,that's the lake in the movie.
Yes it is.
Wow,pretty creepy.
Every time I go by it I think of the movie.
I'm sure you do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved the movie Carrie.
One of my favorites.
Sissy Spacek was so young.
She was very young.
Wasn't John Travolta in it too?
Yes he,was.
He was young too.
Yes,it was made in 1976.
Brian De Palma right?
Yes,that's right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like thriller movies?
What kind of question is that?
I'll take that as a yes.
Who doesn't like thrillers? I mean Fight Club, how can you not like that?
I've never actually seen that one.
How are you alive right now? You have to watch that movie.
I know, everybody keeps telling me I should.
Only because they have a brain. You're coming to my house and we're watching it.
Is it really that good?
Well I can't tell you or I'll break the first rule of Fight Club.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Sixth Sense?
Yes.
Did you think it would end that way?
I had no idea Bruce Willis's character was dead.
That was a cool twist.
I like twist endings in thrillers.
I think the director of The Sixth sense is one of the best at twist endings.
I agree.
Did he also make Signs?
Yes. That is one of the best thrillers ever made.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie called"Chucky" ?
Yes I have, is it about that doll that looks like a clown?
Yes, they are coming out with a new version this summer?
I like to watch those chucky movies they are scary.
One of the versions of  the  Chucky movies,he has a wife. The movie is called"Chucky's Bride".
The movie "Chucky's Bride" is really funny and scary.
The original "Chucky" movie was really  scary when the doll came to life.
Yea, I remember that part ,it was shocking.
The little kid in the "Chucky movie  knew chucky was a live, but know one believed him.
I like all the Chucky movies, I will be seeing the new one when it comes out this summer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know my favorite genre
What is your favorite genre
The Thriller an action movies mixed
What sort of movie are you refferring to
Like the newest Rambo movie
Oh that was a good one
I really really enjoyed it
Yeah it was pretty tight
I want another one
Can Stallone still do it though?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot stand thrillers
Why can you not stand them
That is a understatement
What??
I hate them they are like a cheap mans horror movie
That is a little harsh
Nah not harsh at all
I think so
Well i am speaking my mind
Well i guess its true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the Birds?
When I was a kid. Scared the crap outta me.
That movie isn't scary at all!
It's horror isn't it?
I'd classify it more as a thriller.
Hitchcock was a genious.
There'll be no replacing him.
"Master of Suspense"
Did you see the movie.
Yeah, with Hopkins playing the "Master". To good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Panic Room?
I do not think I have. Who is in it?
Jodie Foster plays the leading role in it.
Is it one of those movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat?
It sure Is! These people break into Foster's home and terrorize her and her child.
Sounds like it could be really good.
We could watch that one or 50 First Dates.
I am in the mood for a thriller actually.
Panic Room it shall be then!
Awesome, I will order a pizza to go with it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the Manchuian Candidate for the first time.
Which one?
Is there more that one?
There was the original in the 60's and then a remake.
It must have been the remake. It had Denzel in it.
Definitely the remake.
It was pretty good.
Yeah. I thought it was OK.
How was the original?
Super bizzar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you seen anything about that new movie "47 Meters Down"?
You mean the one about the sharks?
Yeah it seems pretty scary.
I don't know if I would go see it, I don't like open water.
I agree the setting is really scary
I guess that's what makes a good thriller though right?
You're right. Would you be brave enough to go see it with me?
I think I can get the courage up to go with you.
WHat do you thin kwill be the scariest part?
Oh the sharks lurking in the darkness for sure. They could be anywhere!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Hmm.. probably "The Ring"
Really?  I thought that was a horror movie
Nope!
You sure?
Yea, if you google "top thriller movies" you'll see that it makes a lot of different lists
I never knew that!
It's also a remake from a Japaneese film
I never knew that either!
The more you know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Thriller movies at all?
A little bit.
Which movie is your favorite?
In Her Name.
Who is in that?
Sebastian Koch.
Oh interesting. When did it come out?
2016.
Oh I never heard of it.
Yeah it was not that popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Beat Takeshi?
No, who's that?
He's a Japanese actor and director. He was in a whole bunch of thriller movies.
Like what?
Like Battle Royale. Lots and lots of action movies.
I liked Battle Royale. It was dark though.
He was also in the new American live-action remake of Ghost in the Shell.
How was that? I never got around to seeing it.
Well, I actually thought that Scarlett Johansson was very good in it.
I like her. She's usually pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Liam Neeson?
Yes he is a good actor.
Have you seen his film about going into nature?
No, what is it called?
It is called Into the Grey.
Is it good.
It is a true thriller, filled with exciting nature experiences.
You liked it?
Yes I watched it twice.
Ok then I will watch it, thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie It?
I think I have, it is creepy.
Yeah, the girl in there is weird.
They worked on that movie for six years.
Yeah I think it is a book by Stephen King.
Yeah, I have read the book.
The book is way better than the movie.
That is usually how it turns out.
I am excited to see the new remake of the movie though.
Me too because it has an interesting plot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that Matt Damon movie? The one where he's not what he appears to be?
You mean The Bourne Identity?
No.
The Bourne Ultimatum?
No,
The Bourne Supremacy?
No.
Jason Bourne?
No.
Oh.  The Departed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Shutter Island?
No, what is it about?
It is about a mental institution?
It is about an insane asylum?
Yes, and it is starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
He is a great actor.
This film is bone chilling, super suspenseful, and definitely thrilling.
Wow that sounds like an exciting watch.
Yes this movie is intense and awesome.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Cape Fear?
Yes, with Robert Mitchum?
Well, he is in both, but I mean the remake with Robert DeNiro.
Yes, I love that one too. They are both very thrilling.
Did you like the Gregory Peck one more?
No, I preferred the Scorsese one.
Did you find it scary?
Very, I did not know what to expect at all.
Who is your favorite character?
I liked Nick Nolte's character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what was your favorite  recent thriller film?
Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan.
That is a goodie. Natalie portman is so believable as a ballerina.
I was very impressed with her dance skills in this film.
Me too. I think her and mila kunis trained like crazy hours for these roles.
Ya I guess portman had injured her ribs during filming even.
I liked that they showed the darker world of dance in this film.
Me too, it is not all tutu's and portman's character and performance certainly shows that.
Agreed, dance is pretty cut throat world just like hollywood.
Well I applaud this film for the portrayal. I feel portman's oscar was well deserved for this role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite recent thriller movie?
Probably Black Swan.
Why?
Not only is it a great movie, but the cast and crew are amazing.
Who is in it?
Well, it's directed by Darren Aronofsky and scored by Clint Mansell, a great duo.
Who does it star?
Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis.
Aren't you in love with both of them? Seems perfect for you!
Yeah, that's part of it. But it's still an amazing movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Our friend told us to watch the thriller secret Window.
Good movie. Johnny Depp is in it.
Is he a cop?
No he's a writer.
Is he a goofy character like some of his other movies?
No, not really. He does have some metal issues though.
Makes sense if it's a thriller.
Yeah, you should watch it. I really liked it.
What year is that from so I know where to look online.
I think from the early 2000's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Liam neeson is so fricken cool.
What, the old irish guy?
Old? Please, he is in his prime.
He is at least 60.
But taken was so good! Who cares about his age.
I dont know, its not believable for me.
What, you dont think he cant really be as badass as the movies make him look?
Yeah, its a great film but its all fake.
Whatever. He is still my man crush.
What a twist! This conversation has really 'taken' a wrong turn I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Have you seen any thrillers lately?
Like a thriller movie?
Yes exactly.
I think so.
Where did you see it?
I watched one on netflix.
What was it?
Nightcrawler.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thriller movie?
Poltergeist, even though it's cheesy now that I'm older.
Yeah, that scared me so much as a kid.
Me too, but now I can show it to my kids.
Really, do they like it?
No, they are scared to death, but they kind of like it.
Special effects today are much better, but this movie is a classic.
You're right.  How can you beat the crazy happenings in that movie?
You can't help but like the basic fear factor in the movie.
True, I think that movie will continue to be a classic for our grandchildren too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of that movie where Collin Farrell was stuck in a phone booth?
Phone Booth?
Yeah, he was stuck in one.  And if he moved, they would shoot.
No, that's what I'm saying.  The name of it was Phone Booth.
Oh, I get it now.  I feel stupid.
I remember seeing that and being in awe of his acting.
I don't remember it.
Well, I just remember he totally lost his accent.
I'm sure he does that for all his roles.
I wouldn't be able to do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a good thriller for you. What Ever Happened To Baby Jane.
Wow,that was great.
Two icons,Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.
They were enemies too.
Yes they were.
Anne Bancroft actually won for Best Actress.
Yes,Joan Crawford campaigned for her to get it.
Right,she wanted anybody but Bette Davis to win.
That exactly what happened too.
Yes it did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
John Wick
That move is awesome!
Yea, it restarted Keanu's career
I feel the same way.  He never had much since The Matrix
For the most part, yea.  Constantine was OK.
Yea, Constantine did decently well, but not as much as John Wick
Agreed.  He really needed that movie
Yea, and John Wick 2 is out
I so want to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Unbreakable?
Yes I have and it's one of my favorite Shyamalan movies.
Me too, next to Signs and The Sixth Sense of course.
Unbreakable is one of those movies that satisfies both comic book and thriller geeks alike.
You're right. I believe they're coming out with a part two this year.
And I believe the movie Split is going to tie into it. They gave a little teaser at the end of Split.
Oh yeah that's right! I absolutely cannot wait to see it.
M. Night Shyamalan has been doing a lot better lately.
He's definitely redeemed himself from movies like The Village and The Happening.
We don't talk about those movies if we can help it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Tom Cruise's The Mummy?
I have! I watched it with my mum. She's a big fan of him.
Did you like it? I found it to be boring to be honest.
I found it boring too. I especially didn't buy the love story.
Right? It was so forced. At the end of the movie I couldn't care less if the woman died.
The whole movie was bad. The only character I liked was Princess Ahmanet.
I liked her too but even her story was flawed, why bring a devil king to rule with her if she wasn't interested in competition?
Yeah, I guess. At the end of the movie there really wasn't any character you wanted to cheer for.
Exactly. I heard they're going to make more from this Dark Universe or something.
That's what I heard too. I hope it isn't as boring as this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am in the mood to see a movie tonight!
Me too. How do you feel about seeing a thriller movie?
I love thriller movies. The last one that I saw was Don't Breathe.
I don't think that I ever saw that one. Did you like it?
It was alright. I would not watch it again.
Well, The Mummy is playing in theaters now. How do you feel about seeing that?
I love the Mummy movies! I did not know a new one was out.
This one is starring Tom Cruise. I don't think it has any of the old cast members.
Anything with Tom Cruise is good.
Agreed! What time do you want to see it tonight?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the movies the fugitive?
I did!, Harrison Ford is great in it.
I agree, the whole part about the one armed man was really interesting.
Right? not to mention the twist at the end.
Yea that was a really good twist.
I agree, did you see Enemy of state?
Is that the one with Will Smith?
Yeah, it also had Gene Hackman.
Oh, right. Yeah, I saw that. It was pretty good.
I thought it was great, maybe the most underrated Will Smith movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Seven?
Is that the thriller with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman?
Yes, what did you think of it?
I really liked it a lot. I was so dark and creepy.
It was especially John Doe's books.
Did you know all of John Doe's books were real books? They were written for the film.
Wow. I had no idea.
To me, that makes the movie even creepier.
Yeah, that fact that someone had to sit and write all of that out is crazy.
Let's hope they got paid well for it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have mixed feelings about The Usual Suspects.
Why?
It's a fun movie at all, very engaging.
Yeah, Kevin Spacey is great and it's one of his first.
It's just kind of underwhelming.
WHy?
There's a ton of build-up, and he walks away and it makes sense, but I just didn't care.
Hmm, I liked it. It worked for me.
Favorite moment?
Probably when I saw it coming about 10 minutes ahead of time. That or the lineup where they're all just kidding around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you consider The Sixth Sense to be a thriller or horror? I see it listed as both.
It's a thriller, no doubt.
Why not horror?
Just because it has ghosts and dead people doesn't make it a thriller. They're not interacting or causing anything.
So it's the mystery and suspense?
Yeah, you never feel scared in the movie. You just want to hear and see what's happening.
Did you enjoy the twist?
Yeah, but I can't watch it again.
Why not?
The problem with a thriller that has a twist is you can only see it once or twice, because you know exactly what's going to happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any new thriller films coming out that you are excited for?
The Stephen King’s IT remake is a big one for me. That first trailer was great!
I completely agree with you. It definitely looks like it has potential. Have you seen the original TV movie?
I have, yes, a long time ago. Unfortunately, it hasn’t aged well, in my opinion.
I can’t disagree with that, but Tim Curry was still amazing as Pennywise.
Yes, it definitely seemed like he was enjoying himself behind all of that makeup.
What do you think of the new actor and look for the remake?
I think it looks good, for the most part. I have read that they are going to make the film more like the book.
I have heard that, too. That could make the film a huge success.
For sure, and it could also make it more popular for the Stephen King fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like movies that are thrillers?
Yeah I do enjoy those.
What about them do you like?
I like that it is really intense, really engaging.
I know what you mean.
It's even more so in theaters.
I do like seeing movies like that in the theaters.
It adds to the atmosphere doesn't it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hi, how are you?
I am fine. what about you?
I'm good. So have you seen any thriller movies lately?
Oh yes, I just saw the last part of saw movie.
Oh, So how was it?
It was mediocre.
why is that?
I feel that they have unnecessarily prolonged the storyline.
yes, exactly . I feel the same way.
I mean they have prolonged so many parts even after jigsaw died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the original Psycho?
Yeah, pure classic.
Norman bates just seems so normal when you talk to him most of the time.
A bit of a mama's boy though.
Even though he killed his mother.
The ending was a little twisted too.
Where he wouldn't even kill a fly.
That's why Hitchcock is the master of suspense.
Don't forget the shower scene.
Still one of the best movie scenes ever made.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go see the My Cousin Rachel soon.
Who plays in it?
Rachel Weisz plays in it, and she is a villain in this thriller.
Who directs it?
Roger Michell is the director, and it just opened the other day.
SHe plays a dark personality and killer in that one I think
Yes, it looks really good, I want to see it.
Are you going Saturday?
Yes I am, should we meet for it?
I will also ask my sister if she wants to go too.  See you then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what was the last thriller movie you saw?
God, it's been awhile since I've seen one. Probably Fast 8.
Why do you think you haven't seen a Thriller since Fast 8?
Well I love The Rock and Vin Diesel. Haven't seen a cast or story that matters that much in a thriller!
What about the new Transformers movie? Didn't it just come out?
Yeah it did just come out, but I have no interest in it. It looks really really bad! I don't think they are even trying anymore with the movies!
Michael Bay sure does love his explosions. What about The Mummy?
Hey that might be a good one worth checking out! I'm not that big of a fan of Tom Cruise except in MI and Top Gun.
Well they are working on another Mission Impossible! It's supposed to be out soon I think!
I'll have to look into it! Those are some killer thriller movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Shutter Island?
You mean the one with Leonardo DiCaprio? It was good.
It really was. I never saw the twist coming even though I feel like I should have.
The whole atmosphere of that movie was incredible.
Martin Scorcese is such a wonderful director.
I know he did a really good job on the thriller Cape Fear also.
I saw that about a million times and I've even seen the original.
The one with Gregory Peck right?
That's the one. Although I prefer the updated version with Robert Deniro.
Yes he's one of the best actors of all time, especially when it comes to thrillers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Seven for the first time last night.
How did you like it?
It was really intense. Especially the ending.
It is a big twist.
It has such a great cast, too!
It's been a long time since I've seen it. Who is in it again?
Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, and Kevin Spacey.
Oh, yeah. I remember Kevin Spacey's character really well.
He was so creepy in that movie!
In the best possible way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite scary movie?
I love the paranormal activity series
Cool, those are pretty fun!
Yeah, it always freaks me out when they do the jump scares
oh do they scare you
yeah because you never know when they are coming
what is your favorite one from the series?
My favorite is the second one
why is that
The situation and plot is a lot more scarier than the others
XXXXXXXXXXX
What actor is the best in thrillers?
I would go with Clint Eastwood myself.
Really? Which ones has he done?
He has some really good thrillers. Have you heard of Blood Work?
Yes! That was a good one actually.
Absolute Power was another really good movie.
I have not seen that one before.
It is really good. Have you seen A Perfect World?
Nope! I am going to have to catch up on Clint Eastwood thrillers!
Yea, he has some very good movies out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Francis Ford Coppola movie?
The Godfather, by a long shot.
Which one?
All three.
Can't decide, huh?
They're all too connected.
What if I made you an offer you couldn't refuse?
What a dork!
Come on! Pick!
I'd have to say the first one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you remember all the hype over the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?
Yes I do remember all the talk.
It was not just hype and talk, the movie walked the walk.
You like it?
Yes it is worth watching twice.
Wow I haven't even seen it once.
Make time for it, it is long and great.
Ok thanks for the recommendation.
You are welcome, enjoy the excellent thriller, its an exciting watch.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the 1990's  thriller movie Primal Fear?
I know I have at least heard of it. Who is in it?
It's with Edward Norton and Richard Gear. It's actually a pretty good movie with a crazy twist ending.
What is the movie about exactly?
Richard Gear works as an attorney for Norton's character, who suffers from multiple personality disorder and is on murder trial.
Doesn't sound too bad. How is the acting, especially of Norton?
I think Edward Norton completely steals the show, in my opinion. He is real good at bouncing back and forth between the different personalities.
Primal Fear sounds like a good "Popcorn flick", as they call it these days.
I would strongly suggest you check it out sometime. I will not spoil the ending.
Okay sounds good and I look forward to seeing it one of these days!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw that movie Split last night have you seen it?
No, was it good?
It was definitely tense.  This guy takes these three girls from a parking lot and holds them hostage only he's got multiple personalities.
Definitely sounds interesting.  Didn't M. Night Shyamalan do that one?
Yeah and its kind of related to Unbreakable but I won't spoil it for you.
Thanks, maybe he's making a come back.
I think so.  The Visit was good too.  I never did hate his movies though.
I thought Lady in the Water was an absolute bomb.
Oh yeah, that one was no good.  People didn't like The Village though and I did.
I though it was ok.  I called the twist from a mile away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Get Out?
We rented it last weekend.
What did you think?
I really liked it. Have you seen it?
No, we are gonna watch it tonight. Don't give me any spoilers.
I won't but I will tell you it is a nice blend of horror, thriller, and some comedy. I think you'll like it.
I wanted to see it because it has Allison Williams from Girls.
She is great in the movie. I will also tell you it stars Bradly Whitford.
He looks so old in the trailers I have seen for the movie.
He plays Allison's dad in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Shining?
The original with Jack Nicholson? Of course I have.
It's actually my favorite horror movie of all time.
What do you like so much about it?
Well I love Stanley Kubrick's directing, the symbolism in it, the suspense, everything.
I saw a documentary on it once about the subliminal messages Kubrick put in there.
Was it called The Shining Decoded? I saw that.
Yes and there's another one called Room 237 that went into a little more detail.
I'll have to check that one out. That scene in the maze was pretty terrifying.
Oh I know, that one and the one where he was chopping down the door.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to watch Alfred Hitchcock movies?
I have only seen a few of them.
I have seen a great many that he directed.  He is the master of suspenseful theater.
What is your favorite Alfred Hitchcock thriller?
I don't have a favorite, but I really like "North by Northwest."
Is that the one starring Cary Grant?
Yes.  It stars Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint.  Cary Grant is a victim of mistaken identity, and Eva Marie Saint is mixed up with some bad guys.
I think I have seen that.  Don't they end up at Mt. Rushmore?
Yes, the scenery is spectacular.  I read that the producers were denied access to Mt. Rushmore because of the negative connotations of the movie chase, so they had to film it on a movie lot.
It looked pretty realistic.  They did a good job for the time period.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Hitchcock thriller?
I think that Rear Window is my favorite.
I think that Suspiscion is mine.
Why do you say that?
Well, I like that you never know whether or not Cary Grant is trying to kill her.
Although, since he wasn't trying to kill her, she looks like a really bad wife.
LOL!  That's true.  What do you like about Rear Window?
Well, it takes a while to figure out whether or not there was a murder.  I also think Grace Kelly does a great job.
I think she's overrated.  But, I think Thelma Ritter was great.
Thelma Ritter was great in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, to me the greatest thriller of all time was Silence of the Lambs.
Oh, I loved that movie!  Especially Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.
He was awesome.  Crazily enough, he's so memorable even though he's only in like twenty minutes of the entire movie.
But you know what I find kind of interesting about that movie?
What's that?
It won an Academy Award for best movie of the year, but what's interesting is they labelled it as a "thriller" instead of a horror film.
So, you think it should have been labelled a horror film?
Yeah, of course.  It has a guy going around killing wearing so he can wear their skin.  Yeah, that sounds like horror movie to me.
Why do you think they called it a thriller though?
Well, cause horror movies in general aren't popular with the Hollywood Elite.  They're considered "low art" by many.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In your opinion, what is an underrated thriller film?
I think the movie 1408, based off the Stephen King short story is a good example.
I absolutely agree. That is actually one of my favorite scary movies!
It's a very simple, and yet interesting story following Michael's character.
I really enjoyed his overll struggle with the room and just how the room got to his inner emotions.
Exactly. Especially towards the end where the room has him vision his daughter dying in his arms.
That was definitely a "Wow!" moment to me. Very sad but also it captures how evil the room was.
Agreed. Do you think he truly escaped the room?
In the original version, yes he did. But there are multiple endings.
Oh, that's right. I prefer the ending where Michael survives!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Scarface
A classic!
Yea probably one of the most classic known movies
I agree!  What's your favorite part
"Say hello to my little friend!"
The most cliche favorite part
But one of Paccino's best of all time
Agreed!
Awesome movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Saw?
Yeah that was awesome.  Every second you were completely fooled.
Tell me about it.  That guy on the floor the whole time was Saw.
Yeah, and the guy he was chasing seemed like a genius in his own right.
Yep, but he was just another pawn.
That's what was so crazy.  The whole time you thought wrong.
Yeah, and it shows how smart Saw himself really is.
I know, and how about those puzzles he left?
Yeah they were crazy.  Basically kill someone you love or die yourself.
Yeah, it was like all a distraction, look here so we can fool you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the main villain in Fatal Attraction?
Glenn Close
Is she good in the film?
She is very scary
Is there a lot of scary parts?
Yes. The tension is crazy
I wanna see it
It is one of the best thrillers ever made
Really?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch every Tarantino film?
No, I havent seen every movie.
You should watch Jackie Brown.
Is that one good?
Yes it is a great film, it is thrilling as well.
I do like the director.
Yes his films are great.
Ok I will watch it.
Enjoy the thrilling story that develops in that film.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie" Puppet Master"?
No, What is that movie about?
It is about a man who has puppets that come alive.
That sounds like an interesting movie.
I am waiting to see the movie "Friday the 13" the remake.
I did not know there is remake of Friday the 13" movie 2017.
Yes it  looks like it is going to be really good.
I saw "Friday the 13th " part 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
The first "Friday the 13th came out in the 80's.
I like the movie "Hell Raiser" that came out in the 80's too, and it has 4 parts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thirller movie?
Probably The Devils Advocate
Oh that's a good one!
Yea, I love the female actress in it
Oh, you mean the main one?
Yea she did a great job
Yea, expecially when she was posessed
I wonder how much they paid her to go topless
I'm not sure!  She was probably new in her career so not much!
Yea they can get away with that at that point haha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen 47 meters down?
No, but I really want to.
I kind of do too. I really like Many Moore.
I don't care much about Mandy Moore, but I love a good shark thriller
Well, I became a fan of hers because of a tv show I watch called This is Us
Oh yea, I've seen that. It's good. But I prefer thrillers.
I definitely love a good thriller too. I hope the movie is good.
As long as the sharks are eating people, it will be good.
I doubt that Mandy Moore gets eaten.
You never know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of that one new movie about a guy with split personalities?
You mean the movie Split by M. Night Shyamalan?
Yeah that movie was pretty freaky in some ways. I found the Beast and Hedwig personality to be the most creepiest.
No kidding. James McAvoy's portrayal of that character and all the personalities was pretty amazing.
What did you think of the twist at the end?
I was a bit surprised since I didn't realize it was in the same universe as unbreakable. I would definitely like to see another sequel where David Dunn goes after The Horde.
Do you think Casey told the cop lady at the end of the movie about what her uncle did when they found her from The Horde?
I think so because she gave them this look as if she was going to.
If they do make a sequel to this movie about The Horde played by James McAvoy, would you see it?
Oh yeah I definitely would since it did keep me in suspense a lot with this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Jake Gyllenhaal thriller movie?
Has he been in many?
I think so.
Like what? I know prisoners but what else really?
Nightcrawler, zodiac,donnie darko,nocturnal animals. life. I am sure there are even more.
Listed liek that he has been in a lot. I would say Donnie Darko or Nightcrawler.
I feel a lot of people overlooked nightcrawler. It was actually a great film.
Jake Gyllenhaal's performance in nightcrawler was oscar worthy in my mind.
I really liked him in that role too. Louis bloom I believe was the character's name. Such a raw performance from jake.
Agreed, overlooked performance and movie in general.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite kind of movies?
I like thrillers a lot.
Which type?
I like any kind. But, I like supernatural the best.
What are some of the best in your opinion?
The Others always got me,
With Nicole Kidman right?
Yes, saw it when I was a kid and it thrilled my socks right off.
There is one like it called, The Things.
Is that he one with the spiders?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Jaws?
No, but I've heard a lot about it.
It's pretty scary.
Really? Just looked like some dumb shark movie to me.
Oh, I love shark movies.
Well, me too actually, but that one looks so old.
It is old, but that just means they had to rely more on story and suspense instead of computer graphics.
That's true, I never looked at it like that.
Yea, you should check it out, when that music starts playing, it really gets your blood pumping.
Ok, I think I will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Nice Guys?
Yes, Russell Crow is hilarious in it.
I agree. I loved his chemistry with the guy from the notebook!
Ryan Gosling?
Yes, I forgot his name for a minute.
Would you consider it a thriller movie though?
Yes, because it has moments of suspense.
I thought maybe it was a buddy cop movie.
Can't it be both?
You are right, it can be both.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see that crazy Harrison Ford thriller where his whole family got kidnapped?
I don't think so. When did it come out?
I think it was bout ten years ago.
It doesn't ring a bell. Do you remember what it was called?
It had something to do with computers. Oh, it was Firewall!
I remember seeing previews for that, but never saw it. Is it worth a watch?
I think if you like thrillers, you'd like this movie. It's not deep, but it's a fun ride.
Is it dark though? I don't like movies with sad endings.
No, I don't think so.
Maybe I'll have to watch sometime then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Flight Plan last night.
Jodie Foster?
Yes.
Who directed it?
Robert Schwentke
What happens in the movie?
Jodie gets on a plane with her daughter, who disappears.
Cool.  What happens in the end?
Jodie rescues her daughter and blows up the bad guy!
She's always resourceful in her movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your all time favorite Thriller Movie?
Hmmm there is so many it would be hard to choose from.
Ok one of your all time favorites then
i guess i would have to say The Silence Of the Lambs.
I actually have never seen that one if you can believe that.
Really you got see it Its kinda old school but if you watch it you will see how alot of movies that came after it were influced by it
I'll have to do that when I have time. Have you ever seen Shutter Island?
Yes with my boy leo in it I loved that movie and totally did not see the twist at the end.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Gravity?

I appreciate your recommendation.
Yes let me know what you think, I thought it was excellent, dramatic and thrilling.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Inferno?
What was the Inferno movie about?
When was the Inferno movie in theaters?
Was the movie scary?
Was the movie realistic?
Who were some of the characters in the movie?
Where did the movie take place?
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Usual Suspects is one of my favorite movies have you seen it?
I have, but I did not love it.
How could you not?
I had it figured out the first 5 minutes. So no mystery in it or joy ride finding out.
Ah man, that kind of sucks, but it still a great film.
It is good but not that great to me.
I still like to watch it even knowing all the spoilers, I think the performances are masterful.
Kevin spacey is good, but I saw right through him.
Interesting fact. Soze is Turkish for "talks too much".
That is kind of funny. I like that. Thanks for sharing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is in Marathon Man?
Dustin Hoffman
He is a great actor.
I agree. He has many good roles
What is his best?
I am going to go with Marathon Man
I loved Laurence Olivier in it
Yes. He played that evil part very good.
The scene where he gets his cavity poked is too hard to watch
Yeah. That scene was extreme
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Taken
Liam Neason?
Yea, he did awesome in that film!
He was memed so he did for sure!
Yea and when he just delivers that classic line about his "particular set of skills" you just get this huge grin on your face
I know just what you mean!  I did the same thing!
The sequal isn't too bad either
Yea I like both of the movies actually
Same here!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What movie do you reel like watching?
I'm kind of in the mood for a thriller.
Action or suspense thriller?
I was thinking like Olympus has Fallen.
That one was awesome. Gerard Butler is always great.
He's one of my favorites.
Have you seen the second one?
They made two?
Yeah, the second one is London has Fallen.
Problem solved, we are watching that right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think one thriller that is slightly underrated is The Butterfly Effect with Ashton Kutcher from 2004. Have you seen it?
I have not seen that, honestly. Ashton Kutcher doing a thriller movie, really?
I was caught off guard by it, as well. But when I saw it for the first time back then, I thought it was pretty good.
Does it still hold up after all of these years, including Kutcher's performance?
I still think the movie is fine if you take out the college rock music from that time period.
What's the film about exactly?
A young college kid played by Kutcher, discovers he is able to travel through time and does so in attempt to make life better for he and his friends.
That doesn't sound like too bad of a plot. Is it really Sci-Fi like?
Actually, no. While it is a thriller, there is also some decent drama in it.
I am definitely interested in this movie and may just check it out sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of thrillers?
As long as they're not violent they're OK. I don't like a lot of violence in a movie.
Neither do I. It's not entertaining to me.
I don't understand why it would be to anyone.
I saw 'What Lies Beneath' and the suspense was great.
That's an older one, right?
Yes, it came out about 15 years ago.
I may have seen it but I can't remember. I think it used to be shown on HBO.
Yes, that's right.
I couldn't believe the ending in that. I was surprised.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen memento?
No, is that new?
No, it's actually really old but really interesting.
What's it about?
It's about a guy who can't hold his memories for more than a few minutes at a time due to an accident.
Oh, that is interesting.
Yea, but the thing is, the whole movie is played backwards.
Oh wow, never heard of anything like that.Oh
Yea, you should check it out, he's actually trying to find the person that murdered his wife.
I think I will, although I think I can guess the ending.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Halloween movies are there?
Many, I just saw on t.v. the one about 20 years later.
Was it as good as the first one I saw in college?
No, none of the followup ones were ever as good as the first.
I bet lots of people got murdered, though.
Yes they did and Jamie Leigh Curtis looked just as good now as she did then.
Did she get killed this time?
I won't tell you because I don't want to spoit it for you.
Well, do you think there will be more Halloween movies?
Of course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like horrir films?
I love them , one of my favorites is the 1st original nightmare on elm street
Are there any stars in the film?
Yes, Johnny depp was in the 1st one and he was really good
Why did you like that movie so much?
I like the story line, how if you go to sleep and Freddy comes to kill you if you don't wake up you can die.....its such a creative story
Do you have any other horror films that you like?
Oh yes, I also like the original Friday the 13th and Halloween with Jamie Lee Curtis
Did you get scared after you watch the movies?
I do, but it's more disturbing than anything else
XXXXXXXXXXX
what thriller have you watched recently?
I just watched an old one from the 80s.Blood simple.
I have never heard of it.
I had not myself, it was done by the coen brothers.
Must be one of the first ones they did , if that far back.
I think it was their first feature. It was good.
Who is in it?
Francis Mcdermott.
I like her alot. Now I am even more surprised I don't know this film.
It was weird to see her so young. I also think of her as an older mother type.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen now you see me?
Yes those are really good movies
Im suprised a movie about magic was so good
Me too
I liked the plot of the movie
Me too
It was really good
All the actors were good too
Yes they made good castind choices
They did
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best thriller of all time?
On the internet people tend to say that Inception is one of the best!
I haven't seen that movie yet, can you describe the plot?
There's a team of specialists who are able to infiltrate people's dreams and plant an idea
That's cool, but why would they want to plant an ideas in someone's mind?
You'll have to see the movie!
Who is famous in that movie?
There's Leonardo Dicaprio and some others
I'm thinking of another guy's face but I don't know his name... Joseph something.
Oh, Joseph Gordon Levitt! He's great in the movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is High Tension very thrilling?
Yes
What happens at the end.
If I told you, it would ruin it
Okay. What is it about?
It is about 2 girls that get caught up in a murderer's killing spree.
That sounds intense
It is very intense
Is it a foreign movie?
I think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey!  How have you been?
Great!  It's been a while.
Yes, it has.  What have you been up to?
Actually, I have been watching movies lately.
Really?  What kinds of movies have you been watching?
Recently, I have been watching thrillers.
Sounds interesting.  Any reason?
They seem to always keep me on the edge of my seat.
Me too!  I am always trying to guess what will happen next.
What is your favorite way to watch thrillers?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that the older movies are better.  Have you ever seen Rear Window?
No I don't think I have.  What's it about?
James Stewart has two broke legs and is watching his neighbors through binoculars. He thinks one of them killed their wife.
Does he call the police?
At first, but the guy hid all of the evidence so James Stewart sets out to prove him guilty himself.
How does he do that?
He gets his girlfriend and his housekeeper to help him.  Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend.
Who plays the bad guy?
I think it's Orson Wells. It gets really scary because he catches on to being watched and then tries to kill James Stewart.
This sounds like a movie I need to watch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Dark Days.
Is that after the Gillian Flynn book?
Yes.
Wow, she's getting quite popular with the movie makers.
Yes, two movies in two years.
Who's in this?
Charlize Theron is the big name.
Who directed it?
Gilles Paquet-Brenner.
I might watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite type thriller type of movie?
I love the Taken series.
Oh my gosh, me too. I was on the edge of my seat during the entire first movie.
Liam Neeson plays the role so well. He is so believable.
Ya. He is one of my favorite actors.
I love how you don't know what is going to happen during the movie and it just takes one turn after the other.
Ya I couldn't stop watching. A movie has not kept me that interested for a long time.
It was also pretty emotional once he saved her.
I know. I felt horrible for what happened to her best friend though.
Ya it is terrible and quite a lesson.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Departed?
Is that the one with Leonardo Dicaprio?
Yes it is.
No I never saw it.
It is a really great movie.
Why is that?
There is a lot going on in it.
Ok and is it a thriller also?
Yes it is very thrilling.
Ok I will watch it, thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm going to go see that new M. Night. Shyamalan movie tonight.
The one about the kids visiting their grand parents? I've seen that one.
No. The Visit was out last year. It was pretty good too.
Oh so he's got a new one already?
Yeah, it's called Split. James McAvoy is starring in it.
Is Joaquin Phoenix in it too? He was in a couple of M. Night movies before.
No he's not. He wasn't in The Visit either.
I know. I miss that kind of continuity. So what's Split about?
All I know is that some nutcase with dozens of personalities kidnaps a bunch of teenage girls.
Let me know how it turns out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Reef?
Is that a shark thriller movie?
Yea, a group of people on a boat crash, and they get hunted by a giant shark.
Yea I think I did see that actually. It was pretty corny.
Yea, but I love shark movies, even when they are corny!
Yea, I admit I watched the whole movie.
They basically just took turns swimming to a reef and getting killed.
Yea, I wish I could be a shark movie writer.
It's not about the story, it's about putting yourself in their place and getting scared.
Yea, definitely. That's why I watch shark movies too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you watch Thrillers?
Yeah I watch them occasionally.
Have a favorite?
I enjoyed Basic Instinct.
Never saw that one, but I have definitely heard of it.
It is a great one.
I should watch it sometime.
You should.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Memento for the first time.
You hadn't seen it before?
No.
What did you think?
I was pretty terific!
I've seen it half a dozen times myself.
Guy Pearce was brilliant.
He is an exceptional actor.
He hasn't been in much lately.
You're right...
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw 'Sanctum' recently. It's a thriller movie about an underwater cave diving expedition.
What did you think of it?
First of all, it was surprisingly realistic. I actually learned a little bit about scuba diving.
Does most of the film take place underwater?
Most of the film takes place in the cave the characters are exploring. The visuals in this film are just amazing.
I'm guessing there's more to the movie than just beautiful scenery.
Definitely. Not only does the tense and claustrophobic atmosphere immerse you in the movie, but so does the struggle for the characters' survival when disaster strikes.
I imagine the fact that something like that could happen in real life adds to the experience.
The movie is actually inspired by a real life cave diving expedition gone wrong.
I heard one of the stunt divers in the film died while cave diving.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Orphan?
Yes that movie was messed up.
For sure I thought the girl was just ill until it showed what she really was.
I know I can't believe she was in her 30's.
She killed the nun, tried to kill the boy and made the mom look so bad.
The movie had me not wanted to even get a drink I didn't want to miss a second of it.
I am going to show it to my mother in law.
She will like it.
The dad on there was so naive and didn't see what she was doing.
I know the poor mom was getting all the blame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies about travel?
Yes I do.
There is a great thriller called called Turistas.
Oh what is it about.
I dont want to spoil anything but its about a traveler's experience.
Ok and it is a thriller.
Yes it is suspensful and thrilling.
Ok that sounds like a good movie.
Yes it really well done, a great and thrilling story.
Ok thank
XXXXXXXXXXX
In your opinion, what the best thriller movie of all time?
I'd have to put Psycho at the top of the list.
Good choice! Alfred Hitchcock is the master of making thriller movies.
He really is. Another of my favorite Hitchcock films is Rear Window.
I don't think I've seen that one. Who's in it?
James Stewart and Grace Kelly.
Yes, I haven't seen Rear Window. What's it about?
James Stewart spies on his neighbors through his window and believes that one of them has committed murder.
Sounds like it's a suspenseful movie.
Another Alfred Hitchcock classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Today is the anniversry of the release of Jaws.
That is my favorite movie, I watch it like once a month.
I used to watch it all the time as a kid.  Its why I can't go into the ocean.
Scared you that much huh.
Yeah, that top view shot they do whenthe shark swims next to the boat and its as long as the boat, that scared me to death.
Were gonna need a bigger boat.
Exactly.  Or when the woman is swimming at the beginning and gets dragged ever all over before being pulled under.
You know they did that scene by tieing ropes around her waist and pulling her back and forth to make it look real.
Yeah, I saw the documentry about it.  Didn't make it any less scary.
No, it didn't but it was great to see how they made it look so real.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, did you ever see Inception?
Oh, yeah, I LOVED that film!
Yeah, my favorite part was that scene where those two guys are fighting and the gravity keeps shifting around on them.
Oh, yeah, that was really cool.  Humor wise though, I thought the funniest part was where that guy turns to Ellen Page's character and he's like, "Quick, kiss me!"
Yeah, and then he's all, "Oh, darn, that didn't work."
Yeah, the whole theater laughed at that one.
What's really amazing is few of the effects that did using computer graphics.  I've read they used them rather sparingly.
Yeah, that was cool.  I only have two major nitpicks with the movie though.
What's that?
Well, I didn't feel the guys on the third stage of the dream much of a threat, even though they had automatic and stuff.  And two, too many movies started using that "bwwwwwwang" sound in their trailers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Misery?
Is that a newer movie?
No, it was probably from the 90s?
Oh, what was it about?
Well, a writer gets in a wreck in a desolate area.  One of his biggest fans takes him in, but she's crazy.
Doesn't anyone realize he's gone?
Well, the police come to ask about him, but she kills them.
Oh, she's really crazy!
Yeah, it's a pretty good movie.
I might need to look into it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies
Yes thats a good genre
I agree
I love the bourne movies
So do i
They are action packed
And matt damon is a great actor
Yes he is
I just watched jason boirne the other day
I habent seen it yet
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Hitcher?
I only saw the old one.
That's the best one. Rutger Hauer is great!
Yes! I love when he wets the pennies and sticks them on the kid's eyes!
And when he tells the kid to say "I wanna die." He was perfect for that role.
Yes he was. Did you see Hemoglobin?
No, I never heard of it.
You have to see it! Great movie and Rutger is in it!
How old is it?
It's from the mid or late 90s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any good thriller movies?
I recently saw Disturbia
What's that movie about?
There is a a high school kid that broke his leg or something and he notices his neighbor is up to no good
Oh is that the one with Shia Labeouf?
Yeah, he is the main actor! He did great in the movie!
Isn't that movie based off an older movie or something?
Yeah it is based off of Rear Window. That movie is way old!
What year did it come out?
I looked it up on IMDB, it came out in late 1954!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched Take Shelter? It's a psychological thriller.
Is that the one with Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain?
Yeah that's the movie. It was really good. Michael Shannon plays a borderline bi polar husband and father who thinks the apocalypse is coming so the takes action to build a bomb shelter while trying to warn his small town of the impending doom.
I haven't seen it yet but I remember people were chatting about how the ending to that movie was such a mind bender.
Yeah the movie is really good. It has you guessing just if he's truly going crazy of it this doom is real. Jessica does a great job playing his caring and nurturing wife.
Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain are both such great actors. I watched Michael in this other small movie recently called Frank and Lola and he was terrific in that as the possessive boyfriend and star chef.
I know. I totally agree with you. I watched Jessica Chastain in Miss Sloane just a short while ago and she played such a strong role as the political lobbyist in that political thriller.
I need to see Miss Sloane, I heard it was really good. What was your final verdict for Take Shelter?
I really enjoyed Take Shelter. It had me in suspense the whole time. It set a really unsettling and uncomfortable feeling throughout and by the end I was in awe at what was revealed.
Okay, no spoilers please. I think I'll have to see if it's available to watch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
whats your favorite movie genre?
I would have a hard time choosing between thriller and horror
I love the old thrillers, now everything is mostly gore and blood with no story
Oh I agree, whats your favorite?
I would have to go to an old favorite, I love "Psycho"
you cant go wrong with that one, everyone feels something with that one
Bateman is so freaky in that, keeping his mother all those years
And that shower scene, I still hate taking a shower with a curtain
Thats funny, but I can see why
Lets go watch it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the thriller movie Vacancy?
Yes, I did. Not that long ago.
Now they run it on T.V. a lot.
That's where I saw it.
Makes you think when you go on vacation.
Yes, but who would just pull into a shady looking motel?
I guess now, nobody would.
Luke Wilson is a pretty good actor.
Yes, I like him.
He played a good part in that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of that ridiculous thriller movie
Which one is it
It had a ridiculous name its called cowboys versus aliens
That sounds like a bad movie
It just sounds ridiculous
and awful
Well i cannot judge it till i watch it
We ca watch it if you want
I am not so sure about that
Afraid of what you will see
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Silence of the Lambs was my favorite thriller movie of all time
I thought Anthony Hopkins killed that role.
Jodie Foster also played a great role.
Yeah they combined to make a great movie.
Jonathan Demme was awesome in it as well.
Hopkins played such a great psycho
I actually felt his performance
Those are the best kind of thrillers
Yeah and you go home with a weird feeling.
Like you are all tense and stuff
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Usual Suspects.
Yes. Amazing cast.
Kevin Spacey at his best.
Could you beleive the end?
When it turns out to be Spacey the whole time?
Incredible. Never saw it coming.
That's what made it such a great show.
True. But you really can't watch it a second time.
You should. It makes in more fun to watch Spacey.
I'll give 'er a go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Seven again last night.
Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman?
And a crazy Kevin Spacey.
Who directed that?
David Fincher.
I forget the wife.
Who can forget Gwyneth Paltrow?
Oh yes, right.  How could I forget the ending?
It was very disturbing.
The seventh sin was committed by the good guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thriller?
Actually, my favorite thriller is a series: the first three "Bourne" movies.
Why are those your favorite?
They're very economical and stylish - nothing is wasted, every scene is well constructed, and the action feels visceral
Did you see the fourth and fifth Bourne movies?
Yes - I was disappointed in both.
I saw the fourth and thought that it was just average and generic.
Exactly - it looked like every other thriller, and didn't continue the intensity and stylishness of the original series.
What about the 5th Bourne film?
It seems like the franchise is played out.  Many of the locales and set pieces were the same, and both Bourne and Matt Damon look tired.  Time to retire the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch The Fugitive?
Is that the one with Harrison Ford?
Yes, that's the one
I didn't kill my wife!
Right, Dr. Richard Kimball
Yeah, that was a classic line and movie
Tommy Lee Jones as the US Marshal was great
Yes, he did a great job in that role
Didn't he win an Oscar for his performance?
I don't recall. Perhaps?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like seeing Thriller movies?
Yes.
What one did you see recently?
I saw The Invasion.
Who was in that?
Nicole Kidman.
Was it good.
It was alright.
Yeah the trailer seemed weird.
It was weird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what was an underrate movie?  Frailty.
Oh, the one with Bill Paxton in it from long ago.
That ending was really cool.
Total twist how he can actually see demons?
Right, and how Matthew Mcconaughey really killed his mother.
Yeah.  I totally didn't see it coming.
That was a very underappreciated movie.  Credit the screenwriter.
And the acting and directing.  It was a great film top to bottom.
It's a shame Bill Paxton didn't get to make more movies before he passed away.
Yeah, sad, he had some real talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Name a movie with a number in the tilte and was a thriller.
Seven, The Sixth Sense, I am number 4, Three The Hard Way just to name a few.
Can you name any of the stars that played in any of those movies?
Morgan Freeman, Jim Brown, Fred Williamson, Bruce Willis and-
Okay, okay. Name a thriller that had two characters going after each other and it has to be old school.
"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane" with Joan Crawford and Bette Davis.
Okay, okay those were women what about a movie where it was men going after each other.
"The Take" with Robert Deniro and the guy that played in a Nazi movie. I think his name was Ed Norton.
You talking about when they were playing thieves and each man planned to keep the treasure for himself?
Yeah,in the end Robert Deniro ended up with the treasure and Ed Norton looked like a clown because he thought he had it. That was good one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie "The Shining"?
Oh that old movie that is set in a hotel with Jack Nicholson?
Yes, that one.  It's so strange but really good and scary.
I always think of the scene with the bloody twins standing at the end of the hallway every time I'm in a hotel with a long hallway.
Oh yeah, and the scene with the blood coming out of the elevators!
Yes!  That movie was great.  There are a lot of conspiracy theories about that movie you know...
I know.  Have you seen the movie "Room 237" that was made about all the conspiracy theories?
I have heard of it but I haven't seen it.
It's great.  I saw it on Netflix and it explains a lot of strange things that are in the movie.
Oh wow.  I'll have to check that out for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Zodiac?
No.  Is it about the Zodiac killer?
Yeah, it's a pretty good movie.
It sounds interesting.  I've read a lot on the Zodiac killer.
Yeah, it focuses on a detective trying to catch the killer.
Sounds good.  Who's in it?
There's a few big names.  Jake Gyllenhall, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey, Jr. to name a few.
Wow, I'm surprised I didn't hear about this one.
Yeah, it came out like ten years ago.
I'll need to find it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm in the mood for a classic thriller movie. Recommendations?
How about "Silence of the Lambs"?
OMG, I've seen it a hundred times. The best! But how about something else?
What about "Psycho" or "Rear Window"?
How about something more recent?
"Gone Girl"?
That's a great one. I'd love to see it again. Good choice.
It's one of my all-time favorite movies of any genre.
It's a great story. Suspenseful. I love the narration towards the end.
It so kept me on the edge. I loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever seen the Hunger Games?
It was really good.  Jennifer Lawrence was awesome.
She was.  She playes a good Mystique too.
Yeah, she's just naturally strong.
The Hunger Games was pretty shocking with sending children to die like that.
I know, you should read the books.  It basically explains it all.
Yeah?  I've been meaning too.
Yep, it goes into more detail about the dangers like those bees they had.
Oh yeah?  Does it explain why everyone teams up?
It does that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite actress?
I would have to say Nicole Kidman.
I like her as well. I watched a great thriller with her in it the other day.
Really? Do you remember the name of it?
Yes it was called Before I Go To Sleep.
I have been wanting to see that one!
It was really good. I think you would enjoy it.
I also like her co-star in that movie as well.
I did not recognize anyone else in it.
Yes, Colin Firth also plays in it with her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have a ever seen the movie The Purge?
No, I've heard a little about it, but don't know that much about it. What can you tell me about it.
The Purge is set in a near future AMerica where unemployment  and crime are at all time lows, and the economy is very strong.
Okay, sounds good, but being this is a thriller, I'm thinking there's a catch?
Yes, all this is due to the The Purge, an annual 12 hopur period where all crime is legal and emergency and police serivces are unavailable.
All crime is legal, even murder?
For the movie, particularly murder. The government was taken over by the so-called New Founding Fathers of America, a totalitarian party that used an econmic collapse to rise to power.
So, people can butcher each other wholesale for a 12 hour period once a year?
Yes, but weapons like explosives or rocket launchers are forbidden and government official above a certain level are exempt, on penalty of summary execution.
Okay, soound's violent and crazy. I'll probably love it, thanks for the info.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You have to see the movie "Get Out"
Oh, it's really good?
It's amazing. Really original.
Isn't it about racism?
It's not about racism exactly. It has some really great plot twists.
I guess I'll have to see it then.
Peele did a great job with it.  The guy is super talented.
Hard to imagine when you just think of him as a comedian.
He had a low budget but got really good work from the actors.
Now I have to go see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Apocalypto?
Is that the one by Mel Brooks?
Yes, he can make some amazing movies.
I have not seen that one.
It is starring real Mayan and ethnic people from central Mexico.
Wow that is authentic.
Yes some of the actors had never acted before.
It is a good movie.
It is one of the greatest movies of all time.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Would you call yourself a fan of thriller movies?
Yeah sure I like them okay.
Cool me too.
Do you have a favorite?
Hmm let me think.
Sure.
I really like Die Hard.  Would you call that a thriller?
I think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Sixth Sense?
It's my favorite movie ever!
What's your favorite part?
I like how the aliens are so creepy and were seen in other countries too
I loved that part, with the Spanish birthday part!
And what is your favorite part?
I like how the aliens are hurt by water, that is so random
And the little girl happened to have tons of water glasses around the house, right?
Yeah she hated dirty water so she left them glasses out everywhere
Oh man, I never saw it coming! What a good ending!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched Room yet?
The movie with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay where Brie won an Oscar for best actress?
That's the one. I watched it last night and it was so good.
Yeah I caught it when it released and was really happy to see Brie get the award for Best Actress. She was so good in her role.
I mean for a movie that had her as a captive for years in an enclosed space with her young son it was so warm and touching. When he escapes to experience life in the outside world for the first time was so touching.
I know what you mean. I was on the edge of my seat when their plan to escape was set into motion and he was in the back of the kidnappers pickup truck.
I was rooting for him to get away. It was one of the most suspenseful moments in a movie I've seen in a long time.
I kept on thinking the kidnapper would come back for them. He was a creepy guy.
I did too. There was such an unsettling feeling and also the tension of the separation from the room for both Brie and Jacob was so heartbreaking.
It was almost like they suffered some sort of Stockholm Syndrome. I really enjoyed Room, such a suspenseful thriller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Old Boy
That movie is disturbing
Yea, the scary thing is I had a friend that was just like the character in that movie
Oh?
Yea, he always was getting in fights.  Just like the guy in the movie
Did he end up getting beat up as bad?
Yea, just as badly as the guy in the movie
Oh, damn.  That's horrible!
Yea, it definitely sucked for him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Next Three Days?
No, who is in it?
Russell Crowe stars as the lead, its a great thriller
Whats it about?
His wife gets arrested and he breaks her out
That sounds pretty cool
Yea, I really enjoyed it
The suspense in breakout movies are something I love
I would highly recommend it
I will definitely check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You'll never guess what movie I just saw?
I bet I can... Was it Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
It was! How did you know?
Everyone is seeing that right now!
It was awesome, man. You gotta check it out.
I want to. You know I'm into Zoe Saldana! Not to mention, Chris Pratt is hysterical.
I think it's just as good as the first, if not better.
Now that's a bold claim!
I know, I know. But trust me, you gotta check it out.
Alright. I'll see when it's playing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like movies?
Yeah love movies.
Are you a fan of thriller movies?
What's a thriller?
It can sometimes be scary or keep you on the edge of your seat.
Oh okay.
An example would be like Jaws.
Oh okay I got it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last great thriller film you saw?
Hm, recently? Probably No Escape with Owen Wilson.
Oh yeah, that was pretty good. I like the Jason Bourne movies a lot, too.
Yes, those are good. He is a very convincing super agent.
What about the older thrillers? Like Fatal Attraction?
Oh, that's so creepy. Great movie. Good cautionary tale.
I also liked one called No Way Out with Kevin Costner. Had a great twist ending.
The one where he's a Secret Service agent?
I think so. It's been a long time. I just remember he made out in the back of a limo with someone.
Oh yeah, that's the one I'm thinking of, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember Linda Blair in the Exorcist movie.
Yeah, it was kind of like "Jaws" at church wasn't it?
What? No it more like Lon Chaney when he played the original Werewolf.
Oh you are talking about special effects. Did you see Tarintino's from Dusk Til Dawn with George Clooney?
Masterful effects that put you in mind of Rod Sterling's "Twilight Zone" didn't it?
Twilight Zone epidsodes played tricks on your mind like the epidsode "To Serve Man."
I saw that. Dick York, Burgress Meredith and Elizabeth Montgomery all starred in that epidsode.
I don't think all three of them was in it but Twilight Zone was a career launching pad for many stars.
Can you name any stars that appeared in Twilight Zone" Episodes?
Adam West, Jack Klugman, Tony Randall and William Shatner from the "Star Trek" enterprise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember The Village?
Yeah.  I dislike that movie?
Really?  I didn't think it was that bad.
It was just dumb.  I knew there was no monster in the woods.
And how on earth would they not be found sooner?
Exactly.  Hunters, planes, just way too much modern day things to not find out.
I laughed when she found the car at the end.
Yeah, totally dumb really.
M. Night Shymalan unnecessary plot twist strikes again.
That's the way I look at it too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the Annabelle horror franchise?
I have. They're the movies about the doll, right?
Yes! A new one just came out recently called Annabelle: Creation.
Is Lulu Wilson in the movie?
She is. She plays Linda in the film.
How is this movie related to the other Annabelle movies?
It is a prequel. It tells the story behind the doll.
Is it scarier than the last film?
That's what all of the early reviews say.
I believe it! The story behind the doll might be scarier than the doll
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Woman in Black yesterday.
Wasn't that the creepy movie that came out a few years ago?
Right.  Had Daniel Radcliffe in it.
Oh yeah.  His wife died and he went to some old estate I think.
My wife jumped so many times in that movie.
You kept seeing the woman in the background in the shadows.
Right, it was very unsettling.
The ending is a bummer to as he died.
His kid too, both hit by a train.  He was reunited with his family which is kind of an odd happy ending.
I believe they made a sequel too, but haven't seen it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, Johnny Depp has a lot of thriller movies.
Really? I have only really seen his Tim Burton films.
Tim Burton is part of some.
What are his thrillers called?
Sweeney Todd is a fairly new one, have you seen it?
No, who else is in it?
Helen Bonham Carter.
Is is scary?
It is, both like suspense and thrills.
I love Johnny Depp in anything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, did you watch any thrillers aside from Taking Lives?  That one's old.
Now that I remember, I recently say The Circle.
I didn't see that one, how did you like it?
I loved it actually!  It was definitely classified as a thriller, but I was laughing and so were some of the other people.
Hmm, now that's interesting.  Tell me more!
Basically only one truly tragic thing happened in the whole movie, which was the death of the girl's ex-boyfriend.
So it wasn't really a scary thriller.
Not really.  Tom Hanks was able to project that "tech entrepreneur" thing very well.
Yes, I could see that a bit from the trailer.  Did he remind you of anyone in particular?
I guess Steve Jobs.  He was always talking about taking things to the next level and acting like a visionary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the revenant movie?
Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor but this role was overrated.
What? This is the role he finally won an oscar with.
That is exactly my point. I think he deserved an oscar for multiple other roles outside of this one.
I thought Leonardo DiCaprio's oscar was well deserved for this role.
I think he deserved an oscar.. in general. But I THINK THE ACADEMY JUST HAD TO GIVE HIM ONE AT THIS POINT AND OTHER ROLES WERE MORE DESERVING.
I for one am just glad he finally got an oscar for anything. it had been a long time coming.
I do agree with you there. He had given so many worthy performances.
Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest living actors ever.
I would even argue for all time.He is really up there for me. I think many more oscars are in his future or at least performances worthy of an oscar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Snow Man will be a good thriller?
I think it will just be a rip off of the old Jack Frost movie.
The one that was kind of a thriller, but also sort of a kid's show?
Yes, I think it will be silly.
Do you know any ones coming out you might like?
I seen one called the Mummy, it is already out.
I really want to see that one.
The reviews said the Mummy was actually really scary.
I love the suspense part of thrillers, like maybe the bad mummy or bad guy might win.
I think the suspense is the best part of any thriller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy Basic Instinct or Basic Instinct 2?
Basic Instinct 2 was trash. Sharon Stone was in it but Michael Douglas didn't return for it.
I don't blame Michael Douglas for not coming back for Basic Instinct 2. The fact they made a second one is a shame.
Did Sharon Stone do any other notable movies after Basic Instinct. She sort of just disappeared after being such a big star during that time.
She was in a few movies I remember such as the mother in Alpha Dog and various other roles that I can't recall right now.
Alpha Dog is the movie with Emile Hirsch, Anton Yelchin, and Justin Timberlake right?
Yeah that's the movie, Amber Heard, Olivia Wilde, and Amanda Seyfried were also in it.
What a star studded cast. I guess Sharon Stone just got older and stopped getting rolls. Basic instinct was probably her most notable role.
She was terrific in Basic Instinct. It was such an intense thriller, you kept wondering if she was the murderer.
I know, the movie was very sexy, but very mysterious and dark too, a perfect thriller in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow this movie is really got me on the edge of my seat
What movie
I am currently watching taken
The one with Liam
Yeah Liam Neeson
I have heard good things about that movie
It is really good
Maybe i should get around to watching it
You should
Well now i will thanks to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's your favorite classic thriller?
Oh, I have so many favorites, don't ask me to choose. Touch of Evil is one of the greats, I guess
Yeah, I love that flick. The manly hero is Charlton Heston, and the lovely woman in jeopardy is Janet Leigh.
Un-huh. Suspense provided by lustful bomb-wielding gangsters for a thrill a minute, directed by Orson Welles. What's your favorite?
Hmm--maybe Night of the Hunter, from 1955. This time it's children in jeopardy.
Yeah, that evil sanctimonious preacher-man. He stalks the stolen loot, and goes after the innocent kids to get it.
Plus, he has LOVE tattooed on one hand, and HATE on the other. Robert Mitchum at his most terrifying.
Did you know Charles Laughton actually directed it? It's the only film he ever directed, and it's a suspense masterpiece.
Mitchum sterred in another wonderful thriller, too. I mean the original version of Cape Fear.
Yeah, Robert De Niro is a great actor, and he tried, but he had nothing on Mitchum in the remake.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's you favorite thriller movie?
Oh that's tough there are so many good ones, but I'd have to say Fracture.
Fracture, who's in that?
It stars Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.
I don't think I've seen that one, what's it about?
Anthony Hopkins shoots his wife and then messes with the attorney and gets off.
Is it scary?
No it's one of those movies that keeps your mind going and you are constantly trying to figure out what Anthony Hopkins is doing and why.
It sounds really good.
It really is he plays a bad guy and you know from Silence of the Lambs how good of a bad guy he can be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Girl on a Train.
Cool.  Based on the book?
Yes.  Directed by Tate Taylor.
Who stars in it?
Emily Blunt, Lisa Kudrow.
Was it close to the book?
Yes, pretty much so.
What was your favorite scene?
When Tom lost it in the end and gets killed- by both women!
Justice at last.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the 2002 thriller Insomnia, with Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Have you seen that?
I do not think I have seen that movie. But it already sounds good!
The essential plot is Al Pacino plays a veteran cop who travels for a case over to a small Alaska town to solve a murder case. It also the time of year where this town is light 24/7.
Oh, so it's called Insomnia because not only is Al Pacino on a case, he can't sleep?
Exactly. And Robin Williams is a key in the case and taunts Pacino's character throughout the film.
It already sounds like it could be an amazing watch. Who is the director?
I believe it is directed by Christopher Nolan, who of course, is famous for the Dark Knight trilogy years later.
Nolan has proven to be a fantastic director. I will have to check this one out!
I simply cannot recommend Insomnia enough. Keep in mind, it's a longer movie.
That should not be a problem. With a compelling story and actors, I am not worried about length.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies?
Yes i like action thriller and pyschological thriller
I like more action thrillers
I really liked now you see me
That was an awesome movie
Very suspenseful
It was
And that twist at the end was great
Now i want to see it again
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you believe there are still people that haven't seen the movie Jaws?
I know,I know a couple.
One of the best thrillers ever.
I agree. Made me afraid to go in the ocean.
It made a lot of people afraid.
Steven Spielberg write some great stuff.
Yea,he's the best.
Robert Shaw played Quint. He was great.
Of course so was Richard Dreyfuss.
Roy Schneider was my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that Bruce Willis movie, the thriller?
Which one?
The Sixth Sense.
That one was such a surprise!
The ending, was just wow.
It had me wondering the whole movie, never saw it coming.
I like M. Knight Shmalyan's thrillers.
The way he weaves the story into so much suspense, always gets me.
I loved the one called the Village.
That one had a surprise ending too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Shutter Island?
No I haven't , it looks great.
Yes Shutter Island is a mystery thriller with Leonardo DeCaprio in it.
Who also plays in it?
I think Mark Ruffalo plays in it too.
That one came out in 2010 didn't it?
Yes, but I watched on TNT the other day.
What is the main plot?
Detectives investigate an island asylum for the insane and find not everything is as it seems.
Sounds pretty good, I hope it shows again soon on tv.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Nightcrawler?
Is that a new movie?
Yes, sort of, it is with Jake Gyllenhaal.
Ok I remember seeing the trailer.
It is really great movie.
What makes it so great.
Not only is it thrilling, but the dialogue is excellent.
Ok I will watch it.
Yes, pay attention to the great langauge used by Jake Gyllenhaal.
Ok thank
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
Yeah they are decent.
What ones have you seen recently.
The Harry Potter movies.
What is your favorite?
I like Chamber of Secrets.
Oh I like that one too.
They were all good in that one.
It was relatively light.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen this movie Wait Until Dark?
No, I've never heard of it.
I hadn't either until last night when it was on TCM.
Was it good?
It was outstanding!
Really?  Who was in it?
Audrey Hepburn was the lead.  She played a blind woman being terrorized by some men looking for a doll filled with drugs.
Wow! That does sound interesting.
I looked it up on Rotten Tomatoes and it had like a 95% positive rating.
Maybe I should check it out sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like thriller movies?
Yeah sure I watch them sometimes.
What is a good one that you saw not to long ago.
Hmm let me think.
Sure.
I watched one on netflix.
What did you see?
I watched a good one called The Debt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Bourne Ultimatum thriller?
I think so,  Wasn't Matt Damon in that one as well?
Yes, he plays in all of them I think.
I think that movie came out in 2007, it was a big hit.
It grossed $442.8 Million dollars in the US alone.
Wow, that is a lot of money!  And it was only that one movie.  Can you imagine how much they made for the series?
Oh I am sure over $2 billion or so.
Matt is a fantastic actor. I enjoy watching his movies
It was very high paced, and he finally learns who he is in this one.
They always try to catch him, but they can't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Heathers a thriller?
I would say so.
Christian Slater is great as the bad guy
Yeah. The end is really good. I thought he was gonna blow up the school.
Wynona Ryder did great in that too.
Yeah. That scene in the woods was sad though when those two guys got shot.
I agree. I felt bad for that girl that everyone made fun of too.
But, it was very thrilling.
True
Shannon Doherty was in it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Fargo?
No I missed it.
It is a classic film.
Is that so?
Yes it is really well done, great actors, great plot.
What is it about?
It is a crime related thriller.
Ok that does sound interesting.
Yes and it is filmed in Fargo North Dakota.
That sounds like a good movie, I am looking forward to watching it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Revenant?
Only like 6 times!
A fan, huh?
Leo is my favorite.
It was a really good show.
And he finally got his Oscar.
I wonder why it was for that one?
It was great, but I agree he's done more worthy work.
Starting with Gilbert Grape.
That was a stellar performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thrillers?  Scary movies?
Yes, I do.  I love a good scare!
Well, have I got a suggestion for you.  I saw a really good one called "The Boy" starring one of the actresses on "The Walking Dead", Lauren Cohan.
Oh yeah? What's it about?
A young American woman goes to England to work as a nanny on an old, isolated mansion estate.
What's so good about it?
The child she's supposed to take care of is actually a doll!  The boy was in a fire and the parents treat the doll like their lost son.
Really?  That doesn't sound all that scary-just strange and sad.
Well, the parents go on holiday and leave the nanny with their "little boy".  Some very creepy and frightening things start happening that made me about jump out of my skin and I don't scare easy!!
Thanks for the recommendation, it sounds good.  I'll look for it and watch it as soon as I can.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest Jason Bourne movie?
With . . . what's his face - the guy who played in "The Martian".
Matt Damon.
Ah yes, Matt Damon. Are you talking about the one with the guy looking for the pills so he doesn't regress?
No, that's with Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross.
Oh, then I'm not sure which one you're talking about.
It's simply called "Jason Bourne". It came out in 2016.
I haven't seen it, then. Aren't these series based off some books?
Yes, they are, by a guy named Robert Ludlum.
Oh him! I've read some other things by him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am in the mood for a thriller.
Me to! We should rent a movie.
Do you like Sam Rockwell?
I do, but I do not think he has any movies that are thrillers.
He played in a movie called A Single Shot.
Cool, I had not heard of that one before.
Yea, the preview to it looks really good.
Do you know what it is about?
Rockwell accidentally shoots a lady and finds a mysterious box of cash.
Sounds like my kind of movie. Let's watch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen a movie called the Zodiac before?
No, I have not.  It sounds like a thriller.  Did you like it?
I did!  It is about a serial killer called Zodiac who stalks its San Francisco residents.
That is not a new one right?
No, in fact the movie originally aired in 2007, but I watched it recently on television. It is amazing.
Sounds interesting.  Who are the leading actors in it?
Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Robert Downey Jr. play in the movie.
Wow, that is an all star cast!
Yes, they do a great job showing how through the years, they try to find the Zodiac killer.
I will have to check it out soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Leon the Professional? It's my favorite thriller of all time
I've never heard of it! It sounds interesting though! What the heck is that movie about?
There's a professional hitman who teaches an orphaned girl how to kill
What happened to her family?
They got killed by some bad guys
Oh, I bet she was really pissed at them for that
That's exactly why she wants to learn how to kill
Oh that's sounds cool. Who is the main actress?
The little girl is played by Natalie Portman
Oh, I didn't know she was in movies so young!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw a very scary movie!
What was it?
"It Comes At Night."
Oh, yeah! I wanted to see that? The one will Joel Edgerton, right?
Yes, that's the one.
He's a great actor. Is it scary? Is he good in it?
Oh, it's definitely scary. Do NOT go alone. And yeah, Joel is excellent as usual.
Nice. He's the man.
I would say I'd see it again with you, but I'm too scared to do so.
That's alright! I'll have to find someone else to take! I'll let you know what I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched the best thriller the other day it was called The Mummy.
Oh, is that the one with Tom Cruise?
Yes, and it is my new all time favorite thriller movie!
Who plays the princess in this one?
Sofia Boutella is the perfect princess character with real depth and likeability.
Oh fun, Was it as scary as the original one?
I like thrillers so it was not too scary for me and it was far better than the original in my opinion.
I love thrillers that keep you at the edge of your seat. That's how I felt about the original.
Okay, then I know you would love the new one. Tom Cruise is such a great actor and so believable.
Im convinced it is a must see this weekend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a real cool movie on Netflix the other day called Looper.
The one with Bruce Willis?
And Joseph Gordon Levitt with weird Bruce Willis makeup.
Yeah, that was kind of interesting to see.
The movie was very creative.  The very premise was interesting.
I loved the ending to that movie.
How he shoots himself to save the child?
Right.  It was the only thing he could do to change the course of time.
Very creative use of space I thought.
I wish more movies had a sense of physics such as this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see open water 2?
Is that the shark movie?
Yea the one where the friends go on a boat and end up trapped off of the boat. I don't think it's very shark heavy though.
Yea I think it's just more about being stuck int he water.
Yea, the friends start out pretty optimistic and then slowly start to turn on one another.
Yea, it was a good thriller even without the sharks.
I agree, I think in the end a couple survive.
Yea that part was stupid, after all those people died, for two people to live was dumb.
If it was me, I'd feel too guilty to go on after that.
Me too, I couldn't do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The other night, I sat down and watched the classic 1970's thriller, Jaws. You've seen that one, right?
Of course I've seen Jaws, but it's been a long time. I remember thinking it was great.
Yes, it is a great movie. And for being over four decades old, I still think it holds up.
I would assume it does. It's been at least a few years since I've watched it, but I remember enjoying it and felt it has aged well.
I think one of the best things about Jaws is how you really don't see how much of the actual shark.
That is a brilliant thing, but I remember watching a documentary that said that was not supposed to be the case.
Yes, I remember hearing that, too. Because the mechanical shark did not work too often, they had to come up something else.
That is correct and therefore Steven Spielberg then had to have the shark implied.
Do you think that single change made the movie even better?
Yes, I do. There is nothing scarier then something you can't see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Black Swan?
No, I have not.  It sounds like a thriller.  Did you like it?
Oh yes , it was quite shocking.  Natalie Portman and  Mila Kunis play in the Black Swan together.
What is the movie about?
A company's artistic director decides to replace his prima ballerina for their opening production of "Swan Lake," Nina is his first choice.
And Natalie plays Nina , right?
Yes, and she has never really been given such a complex role before. She starts to show her personality in different ways.
The dark swan emerges!
Yes, it is quite terrifying in the end.
I definitely will watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Inception, thoughts?
Probably one of the best movies in the past decade.
What did you like the most about it?
I guess just the general twist and turns it took. You never knew what was going to happen
So, the question that needs to be asked is Do you think he was awake or asleep at the end?
I think he was still asleep.
Why do you say that?
Because his totem was his wife's not his own.
I had never really thought of it like that.
yes, I have been saying it ever since I watched it that he was still asleep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Gone Baby Gone?
Don't remember it offhand.  Who was in it?
Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman...
Oh, I remember it now.  That was a great film.
Very skilfully done by Ben Affleck.
He's a better director than actor in my opinion.
The ending is so sad.  The mother doesn't even really care about her daughter.
It makes you wonder if the guy made the right choice.
He obviously didn't.  That's the crux of the moral dilemma.
What a horrible thing to have to live with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the genre thriller movies?
I watch them occasionally. What about you?
I really enjoy them. Split was my favorite recent one.
Oh, I didn't see that one. Who stars in that?
The main character is James McAvoy. He plays a guy with split personalities.
Oh, ok. I have seen M Night Shaymalan movies in the past that I enjoyed.
You should check it out then. It has some less well known actresses in it who do a fantastic job.
Ok, I will watch it sometime. Are there any other thrillers you would recommend?
It's not a new one, but since it's on Netflix I'll mention it. Shutter Island was good if you haven't seen it.
Oh, is that the one with Leonardo DiCaprio?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the original Psycho?
One of the most thrilling and mind bending movies ever!
Yes, the way Anthony Perkins played Norman Bates was great.
Yeah he had this odd normalness to him that was scary.
Almost too normal though.  There was always something off about him.
Of course, the best part was the show stabbing though.
Yeah, so many movies have made a joke of it.  But that snappy camera work, and suspense is unparalleled to this day.
It was.  Today is often all special effects and no true suspense anymore.
I know what you mean.  It's like they don't work hard anymore.
We need another Hitchcock type director in Hollywood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've never seen a thriller movie before!
How is that even possible?
Can you help me pick a classic one that I should watch this week?
Well there's a good classic called Rear Window
How old is that movie?
It's from 1954, is that too old?
No that's fine
Well if you want a newer one that is a little scarier then watch Disturbia
Okay, that sounds interesting! What's it about?
A teenage guy is stuck at home and starts to suspect his neighbor is a murderer!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to watch Se7en tonight?
Did you seriously pronounce the number 7 within the word "Seven"?
Yeah, that's not what you do?
It's just stylized. It's "Seven."
Oh, sorry. Want to watch it?
Sure, I've seen it a few times. It's a good thriller.
I just want to know why I hear people say "What's in the box?" every once in a while.
Oh, you'll love it. It's a pretty gore-filled thriller, though.
Thanks for the warning.
You'll like it. I don't know anyone who doesn't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of thrillers do you like best?
I love Alfred Hitchcock movies. They are classic nail-biting, squirm in your seat suspense masterpieces.
Do you have a favorite Hitchcock film?
I can't get down to one favorite, because he has done so many films that I love.
Tell me about one of your favorites, then.
To Catch a Thief with Cary Grant and Gracy Kelly is a sparkling combination of suspense and romance, thriller and comedy.
Cary Grant and Hitchcock made several films together, didn't they?
All great, classic thrillers. To Catch a Thief is about an ex-jewel thief who is suspected of being behind a current rash of jewel thefts in France.
But there's romance too, right?
Grace Kelly is one of the people who think Grant is guilty. The ending is a real nail biter, with Grant trying to finger the thief as the police try to shoot him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen What Lies Beneath?
Yes. with Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer?
Yes
I have and loved it.
Is it a good thriller?
Yes. One of the best
Do the actors do a good job?
Yes
I would like to watch it.
It is from the 90's. Hope you like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite sci fi thriller movie?
I would have to say Gravity.
I've never seen that, what is it about?
Its about two people that get lost in space because the station they were on gets destroyed by debris flying around earth.
Wow that sounds pretty intense.
Yes, it is. You should watch it.
Did you enjoy watching it then?
Of course, I love crazy movies about space.
Me too, I'm gonna have to check it out.
Okay, Hope you have fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best thriller movie you have watched?
I would have to say jaws.
Why do you consider that moiew as the best you have viewed.
Never really knew when Jaws was going to appear.
Didn't the shark have a name in the movie?
Yes, the name was Bruce.
Do you have a second favorite?
Yes, I would say Seven.
Why Seven?
The shock when they found Bratt Pitts wifes head in the box.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a really good thriller movie today, it was called "Dark waters".
Was it a good movie?
Yes it was good, it was about a woman being trap at sea.
I saw a similar movie called The Shallows" , it was a pretty good movie.
There is a thriller movie called"Krampus", that suppose to be a good.
I saw that movie, I did not like it very much.
Did you see the movie called" Dead Story" about these kids at this secluded house?
Yes!  I saw that movie, it was scary but a little phony.
The movie" The Forest" was not that great either.
I like most thriller movies even old 1960 classics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the film Unfaithful.
Oldie but a good one, what did you think?
It kept me on my toes.
Wondering what was going to happen next?
Yes, I really like the genre now.
There are several thrillers that are sort of similar.
Like which ones?
A perfect Murder, is one.
What is it about?
It is a remake of an old Hitchock film, "Dial M for Murder". Lots of thrills and lots of twists and turns.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Yeah man she's good

Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food

Kind of.
What was the last one you saw?
I saw Minority Report?
With Tom Cruise?
Yeah.
Was that any good?
It was decent.
Should I see it?
Yeah you may like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thriller movie?
Well I don't really have one, it's more a favorite writer.
Ok, who's that?
The only name that matters, Alfred Hitchcock.
I never saw any of his movies.
You have to of at least seen parts of them.
Not really, I don't really like old movies.
You're telling me you've never seen the shower scene from Psycho, or Jimmy Stewart looking out his Rear window?
Oh, I didn't know those were Hitchcock films.
I don't think we can be friends anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Edge?
Is that the one with Anthony Hopkins?
Yes it is.
No but I saw it didnt get great reviews.
That is because it is a certain type of movie.
What type of movie is that?
It is an underratted, underappreciated thrilling gem of a movie.
Wow thats quite the endoresement.
Yes I loved it.
Ok, based on your recommendation, I will watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any recommendations on a good thriller I can watch with my girlfriend this weekend?
Hm, I don't know. Maybe Black Swan.
What's that about?
It's about a ballet dancer who has "performance anxieties" and loses her mind. Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis are in it.
Oh I like those actresses, but I'm not sure I wanna watch a ballerina thriller. My girlfriend might like it, though.
Yeah, that's why I recommended that one. How about one of the Batman movies?
She's seen all of those. I want to watch something more like Fight Club, but she has seen that too.
How about Inception?
I that's a good movie! I'm not sure she has seen that one, but I know she will like it.
Yeah Leonardo DiCaprio is actually pretty good in it. If she doesn't like that one, you can try watching Gone Girl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like nicolas cage?
Yes he is a great actor
He is
Have you seen next?
Who is in it with him?
Jessica biel
Yes that was a great movie
I agree
The ending was a huge twist
Yes it was
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a good thriller from the past 10 years?
I really liked Shutter Island, from 2010
Is that with leonardo Dicaprio or no?
Yeah he's the main detective, trying to find an escaped mental patient
So is the prison on an island? LIke Alcatraz?
Yeah just like Alcatraz, but a lot bigger
Is the movie scary? I might watch it with my wife
It's not that scary, just very tense and suspenseful
And how good is the ending?
It's super great, there's a big plot twist!
XXXXXXXXXXX
This is sort of weird
Whats weird
Well the fact that i am seeing commercials for this thriller movie
What movie is it
its called john wick 2
Oh yeah i have seen those too
Like where was john wick 1 at
Seriously
I mean it looks cool but i gotta see part one you dig
Yeah i dig
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about thriller movies switching from gory violence to more psychological?
I like it, for the most part; "Babadook" was incredible, but I wish they would quit with the sequels.
I agree, it's like the find a good niche and exploit it until they've run the idea into the ground.
Exactly! "Sinister", for instance, was crazy scary, but the sequel was a clear cash grab.
I felt really weird watching the sequel too, it was basically just watching families get murdered in terrible ways with a little plot thrown in.
And can we talk about Shannyn Sossamon's southern accent? I kept wondering how no one on set said anything.
In that same vein, have you seen Insidious or the sequels?
I saw the first one. I thought it was really good until the end, it got weird and campy in the last third of the movie.
It definitely violated the idea of "less is more" when it comes to showing a monster.
They just got excited about using those scary prosthetics, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey  how are you today? Can I help you find a movie today?
You are so weird? You don't work in a video store any more!
How about a thriller to day? Whatever ait means to be a thriller today?
I like what people used to consider thrillers like Rear Window.
Have you seen the remake with Christopher Reeves? It was in 1998.
No I haven't. But how can you live up to the 1954 version with Jimmy Stewert .
I haven't seen the 1998 version. The Alfred Hitchcock version is just so good.
I love Christopher Reeves so that one might be good.
This is true. He was great as Superman,also in the movie Somewhere in Time, and  there's one other I can't think of at the moment
I think I will watch the 1998 version of Rear window.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Do you have a favorite thriller of all time?
Hmm let me think.
Okay sure.
You know I saw a really good one on netflix recently.
What did you see?
Nightcrawler.
Oh man that is a great movie.
Yeah Jake Gyllenhal is so creepy in that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Se7en
That move is awesome!
I know, right!?
What did you think of the end?
The head scene?
Yes!  That was my favorite part!
Mine too!
I'm going to watch it right now actually!
Good idea!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of Clint Eastwoods thriller movie in the seventies?
I think you mean,Play Misty For Me.
Yes,that's it!
That was really good.
Didn't he play a,radio DJ?
Yes he did.
Didn't Jessica Walter play the nut that stalked him after he slept with her?
That was her,yes.
Donna Mills played his girlfriend.
Yes she did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
Mission Impossible
A big spy fan, eh?
Yea I love spy movies.  My favorites!
What did you think of the second one?
It was decent, except for the soundtrack
Yea the Metallica songs were not my favorites
Cool scenes though with the exploding glasses
Yea, I always wanted some of those
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Batman Begins?
Yes, Bale was the best Batman.
Either that or he was just given the best plot.
That too.  Raz Agul was a good bad guy and Liam Neisan was perfect to play him.
I know right?  I like the realism that was brought to it too.
Yeah, and almost the whole movie was genesis movie.
Yeah, not a quick few minutes in the start.  The whole thing was becoming Batman.
That's what made it so good.
Some of the lines too.
Like Bruce Wayne "does it come in black?"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Ghost in the Shell?
The new one with Scarlett Johansson?
Right, not the anime version.
I did.  Massive disappointment in my opinion.
Right there with you, total missed opportunity.
It looked great, but the plot was just incoherent.
They really butchered it in my opinion.  Could have used another scribe.
It felt like they just thought looking cool would make a good movie.
A lot of these films make a similar mistake I'm afraid.
It will probably be on the clearance shelf soon I'm guessing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Steven Spielberg has written a lot of great thrillers.
He's got a lot for sure.
How about Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
Wow,a classic for sure.
He cast Richard Dreyfus again.
Only a couple years after Jaws.
Two huge hits.
Yes they were.
I think it was way ahead of it's time.
It sure was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite horror movie heroine
Ripley of course
Yes. Aliens is the best.
It feels ageless.
I don't know if I can think of another feminist horror film like that.
It follows had some pretty strong women.
I like that horror films usually do
What about the Descent.
Oh, I love that one
All strong women in caves!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched the bourne movies
Nah  i have not
They are pretty cool
What are they about
They are sort of like james bond but more thriller than cheesy
That sounds cool
I wish that they had more multi media for the universe though
What do you mean
Well their is movies but other types of things would be nice
I guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I haven't seen in a long time?
What's that?
A really good Thriller film, it's literally been years since I can recall seeing a good one.
Oh, you should see Split. It's one of those M. Night Shyamalan films. Really trippy.
Oh Yeah what's it about?
Well not to spoil it. The story is about a man that has 23 different personalities.
That doesn't sound too interesting, what is the appeal of the movie?
Well the guy kidnaps three teenagers and sacrafices them to one of his personalities which happens to be "supehuman"
That sounds very strange. Now I want to see it just to make sense of what you said.
It's pretty good, I thought it was one of the best thrillers of 2016, it really plays on your mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Se7en?
Yeah.  I saw it once, I think.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was really good.
Really, I didn't care for it.
I like stuff like that.  I just didn't expect the ending.
Yeah, the ending was really not expected.  That's what I didn't really like though.
I thought that just sent it over the edge.
I guess it wouldn't have had an effect without that ending.
Well, no because he wouldn't have committed the last sin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved Shutter Island
It was one of Leo's best roles.
I just think with the plot twist.
I didnt not see the idea of him murdering his family.
Yeah that kind of kept you on edge.
It was a bizarre turn of events.
Thats why I think its one of his better roles.
How often does he do those kinds of movies
Yeah he stays away from the thriller genre.
I agree but he can act the heck out of them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie 'Psycho?'
I've heard a lot about it, but I've never watched it.
You should see it because it is a classic.
What's so good about it?
I would say that Anthony Perkins is great in it, and the surprise ending is a shocker.
I've seen other Hitchcock movies, and they are usually pretty good.
Yes, he creates a lot of suspense within the motel.
Is anybody else in it?
Janet Leigh, who is Jamie Lee Curtis' mom, is very beautiful as the victim.
Oh yeah, I've seen some things written about her famous scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why does everyone think Jaws is so great?
Not sure. Bored me to tears.
Maybe its a generational thing....
Possibly.
I do like Dryfuss.
Yeah, he's OK.
Why don't you like him?
A bit too nasally for me
I could see that.
Otherwise, he's alright.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So when is the last time you seen a Thriller movie in the theater?
Actually it was quite long ago.
What was the last movie that you seen?
Sadly it was Paranormal Activity.
Oh ok I love those movies.  I usually wait till they come out on DVD.
IF they make another you should be sure to go to the theater to see it.  It's a better experience.
What was a part in the movie that stands out to you?
I think the best part of the movie is when the girl gets drug out of her bed.
Oh yeah I remember that part.  Very scary.
Yeah I couldn't sleep for days just thinking about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie so far this year?
I would have to say 'Get Out'.
Why did you choose that movie?
I liked this movie because there was action, but it also made you think alot.
I agree with that, this movie had a lot of background story in it.
I agree, it is close to being a non-fictional story.
There was so much buzz about this on social media.
It is amazing how they were about to fit all of the facts into the movie.
I was simply amazing by the acting, it was amazing.
I agree, this was one of the better acted movies this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of thriller movies?
Not really. I do not find being scared entertaining.
I agree. I did think Alien v. Predator was good.
Oh, I did too! I was not scared by that film at all.
I wish they would make more like that. Many thrillers these days are not entertaining.
I know. They only have shock value.
I would rather watch an old film such as Michael Myers.
Those were the best, even though they were horror films.
Maybe I will put one on tonight.
Keep the lights on!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any good thriller movies yet?
I just watched Kill Bill this weekend.
That was a good movie.  Mind twist, action, even a little bit of comedy.
Yeah, one cool part was when the did the anime style part.
Yeah that was good.  The fight scene at the end was great too.
Yeah, and I liked the first scene where she was fighting that lady.
Yeah, and her escape from the hospital.
That was pretty cool.
I liked when they made the sword too.
Yeah, that was awesome.  Just all around a great movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I had to see North By Northwest for film class.
I never saw that one.
A Hitchcock classic.
Who was in it?
Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint.
What was your favorite scene?
It's got to be the scene at Mount Rushmore.
What happens?
Cary and Eva get chased onto the presidential sculptures but they narrowly escape.
Sounds cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was Wait Until Dark made?
1967
Is Audrey Hepburn in it?
Alan Arkin does a great job with his character.
What was his name?
Harry Roat Jr.
The ending is really dark
Literally. The lights go out.
Yeah
That ending was really suspenseful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite thrillers is Fatal Attraction.
That's a freaky movie.
I think Glen Close is great in that!
Yes, but Michael Douglas isn't really sympathetic in that role.
Yeah, you don't feel sorry for him.
I do feel bad for the wife.
I feel bad for the bunny rabbit.
Oh, that poor rabbit.
It does make you want to stay faithful.
Required pre-marital movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen fight club?
Of course, that's a classic.
Yea Tyler Durden is such a cool character.
Well, Brad Pitt makes everything look pretty cool.
Yea, I still don't really get what that movie is about though.
You don't like it?
No, I do! I just feel like it has this huge meaning that I'm not really getting.
Yea I get that sense too. I mean I know it's an anti-coporate movie. But I feel like there's more.
The ending was one of the best twists I had ever seen at the time.
Same here, it totally blew me away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Leon the Professional?
No what is it about?
It is a great story of a mercenary type killer with a conscience.
Oh wow that sounds interesting.
Yes it has really great character development and is a truly unique movie.
Are there any famous stars in it?
A young Natalie Portman is the lead actress.
Wow she is a great actress.
Yes, this movie is excellent, you should watch it.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The departed, have you seen it?
No, is it good?
It's one of the greatest crime/suspense movies out there.
I've been meaning to watch, whats so good about it?
Top quality acting with Matt Damn and Leonardo DiCaprio
What else?
There was a mix of drama, suspense and comedy it all just worked so well.
I'll check it out tonight, I love Matt Damon
You wont regret it, get ready for a lot of boston accents.
I used to live in boston, so I'm excited now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Jaws?
Yeah, that was really good.  I didn't want to swim for weeks.
I know what you mean.  I swim in a lake and always think a shark is waiting for me haha.
Even pools are creepy after that.
The best part is John Williams score to that movie.
Yes, almost like a return of the leitmotif.
Yeah, for sure.  I liked the guy who was the shark hunter too.
Yeah, he was cool. Hardened by his time on the USS Indianapolis.
Of course we know what the best line of the movie was.
Yep, "We're gonna need a bigger boat."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does anyone want to go see the Mummy this weekend?
I do, but I wasn't sure when it came out in theaters.
I think Tom Cruise plays in it with Sofia Boutella, who plays the Mummy.
Are you going to bring anyone along with us?
Yes, I think my brother wants to see it with us if we go.
How about Friday, we can go around 5pm?
Sounds great, I will call him to let him know. He will be thrilled.
I saw that some of the reviews do not look very good.
Critics can be pretty rough on actors and films.
Yes, but I still am excited about watching the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what movie was actually really good?
Which one do you mean?
I'm trying to think of the name of it but it has Ben Affleck in it.
Do you mean Batman Vs. Superman?
No no, not a super hero movie.
Was it The Accountant?
Yes that movie! Have you seen it?
I have. I thought it was so intriguing.
It was amazing, very well written movie.
That guy sure knew his numbers, probably better than he did people. It was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, have you seen any thriller movies lately?
Not lately, but I really liked Taking Lives with Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke.
Yeah, that was a good one as I remember.
It had a complex plot and everything.  I remember I screamed when Angelina Jolie laid down on his bed and he grabbed at her from beneath and his arms went around her.
Yeah, that was creepy...
And it didn't even fit into the plot that much!  I mean, what did that have to do with anything?  It was just from out of nowhere.
Yeah, it's like they did it just to startle you.
Yeah, it was funny how I screamed and everything.
Did you see it with anyone else?
Yes, my parents went to see it, but my stepfather left near the beginning, when he killed that first guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like the 'Logan" thriller movie?
I really liked it, how about you.
The movie was filled with action, so that is always good.
Oh yea, action in a thriller movie is amazing.
I like how the action was throughout the entire movie, no dull moments.
It is rare to find movies with full action throughout.
I agree, that is what made this movie so good.
I was actually amazed because of the action.
The acting was good as well, you think so?
Yes, I had no arguments about the acting, it was good to me as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen gone girl?
Yes that movie was great, kept me on the edge of my seat.
I agree, all the way through I was asking myself if he did it or not.
I know, I totally didn’t see the twist coming at the end.
Yes, that was an insane ending. Speaking of Ben Affleck, did you see the accountant?
No I have not, I wasent sure what to make of that, didn’t seem to blow up at the movie theatre.
Yes I could see why, it wasent amazing but it was a good thriller with a bit of action thrown in.
Interesting, Ben seems to be doing some good movies lately so I should probabally give the accountant a try.
I think you would like it, it’s got a good plot and his acting is up to par.
Cool, I will add that one to my list of movies to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the departed?
Yep sure have. Martin Scorsese is a great director.
He certainly was great on this thriller.
He has lots of good ones. But the departed is one I will always watch if playing on TV.
It is very rewatchable,even knowing everything. Maybe that is the mark of truly good thriller.
Perhaps it fits a lot of other great thrillers. I also think strong acting is key.
true, leo and damon are wonderful in everything as well as deniro.
They had a super strong cast for the departed. Don't forget vera farminga as well.
Jack Nicholson, martin sheen, they really loaded up here with the talent.
So magic thriller formula now great director, cast and script.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really love thriller movies. It's my favorite genre.
What would you say is your favorite thriller movie then?
Silence of the Lambs is definitely on the top of my list.
That movie is great. It is so suspenseful.
It is. Jody Foster is also one of my favorite actresses because of this film.
Oh I know! Her performance was great.
Anthony Hopkin's too. He is just so creepy in this film.
Imagine meeting Hannibal in real life?
I still get chills just thinking about the basement scene.
Me too! Remember the bathtub part? Gross!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the 'Taken' movies?
I loved the first Taken movie.  I did not see the others.
Liam Neeson is such an imposing character as Bryan.
His "I will find you" monologue is one of my all-time favorites in all movies.
It was so well done.  That makes it all the more disappointing that the sequels were so weak.
Did Pierre Morel direct the other two as well?
No.  Taken 2 and 3 were directed by Olivier Megaton.
I see.  I wish they just stopped at the first one, since it was so good as a standalone.
Did you know there was a Taken television series too?
Yes I did.  I didn't find it fun, but it was renewed by NBC for a second season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the movie " The Ring", it was good, have you seen it?
No, I have not seen the new one, but I saw the first one.
The first movie "Ring" was really scary when that girl came out of the TV.
I also like Alien movies, do you?
Yes, I like "Aliens 1,2,3,4,they are all great.
Have you seen that old movie called" Hush"about a woman in a house in the woods alone.
Yes,  that was a creepy movie.
I also like the movie called"Don't Breath", did you see that?
Yes, Is that the movie  about those kids going into a house were a blind man lives to rob him?
Yes, I saw it, it was interesting how it ended.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the movie Psycho with the Norman Bates character. Have you seen it?
I have, actually, yes. But it was a long time ago and I don't remember a whole lot about it.
Does the phrase "Shower scene" ring any bells?
Oh, definitely. That's one of the greatest horror scenes in movie history!
Besides that scene, one very interesting aspect of that movie is definitely Norman Bates himself.
He is definitely a unique character. That's for sure.
I've always liked how he is so unconvincing. He naturally comes off like a nice and charming guy.
That's one thing that probably makes the movie a classic horror film. A character that while he is insane, is still a believable one.
Do you think it should be remade again?
Absolutely not. Some horror films just should not be re-done, even though this one was back in 1998.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Paniv Room?
Oh yea. Great movie.
Jodie Foster is so good in that.
She's good in thriller movies.
Yes she is.
Forest Whitaker played a good part.
He did and so did Jared Leno.
Oh wow,I forgot he was in it.
How about Kristen Stewart too.
She was awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Source Code?
Sounds familiar.
It's the one where the guy has to figure out how to stop a bombing.
Oh yeah, like eight minutes at a time or something, right?
That's the one.
That was a really good film.
The ending was kind of weird though.
Yeah.  Guess they froze time and lived happily ever after.
Kind of weird, but entertaining up to that point.
Most definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good thriller movies lately?
Are you talking about new or old?
It doesn't matter I just want to find a decent thriller to watch.
Silence of the  Lambs was good. Did you ever see Hannibal?
No I missed that one and I really like Anthony Hopkins.
It was pretty good as well
Maybe I will give it a try. I know Jodie Foster isn't in this one.
Yes but Julianne Moore is really good as FBI agent Starling.
Well I gotta scoot. My cat is in the window being harassed by some noisy little birds.
Tootles to you. Until we meet again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Panic Room the other day.
Another Jodie Foster strong girl movie?
Yes, directed by David Koepp.
Isn't Kristen Stewart in that?
Yes, at the tender age of twelve.
She was great in the Twilight movies.
She sure was.  She was good in this one.
Anyone else in it?
I liked Forest Whitaker as the soft-hearted crook.
He gets to play complex roles sometimes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like thriller movies, and if so which ones?
I really liked that movie Disturbia with Shia in it.
Oh, I remember that one, with the neighbor who turned out to be a killer.
Yeah, that movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
It was pretty good, I really liked Inception.
That is a good movie, but do you really think it is a thriller?
Yeah I do, a lot of that movie had my heart beating fast, I was on the edge of my seat.
Inception is one of the best movies of our time.
I agree, pretty much anything Christopher Nolan does is great!
Yeah, another great thriller by him is Memento.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Death Proof?
What is that?
It's a Tarentino film.  A guy is using a car to kill people.
Oh, he's chasing them down in that black car, right?
Yeah!  That's the one.
Sure, I've seen it, but it's been a while.
What's your favorite part?
I like the whole second half.  You know when the girls are chasing the guy down.
Yeah I was freaking out when that girl was on the hood!
Did you know she is a stunt woman in real life?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you enjoy thrillers?
How would you define a thriller?
A movie that keeps you on the edge.  Maybe it has some action in it.
Like the mission impossible films?
I would say that is a thriller sure.
Okay cool.
Did you like those films?
I did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie face off?
Yes I watched it when I was young.
Did you like it?
I think so, I dont really remember it.
It is really a movie for adults.
OK and is it good?
Yes it is very thrilling.
Ok I will watch it.
Its a great and thrilling film.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good thriller movie to watch?
How about Final Destination? That one always gets me.
Oh I remember that, with Devon Sawa?
Yup, that's him.
That movie really scared me when I was a teenager.
Of course it scared you, it was a movie about Death chasing a bunch of teenagers.
It wasn't just that though.
What was it then?
It was how no one really has control. One day you're here, the next you're not, super creepy.
Well, it sounds like you picked your thriller movie then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i do not understand why thriller movies are called thrillers
Why do you not get it
Because it makes no sense to me
Well explain
Well they are often creepy and stuff
Yeah and?
So should they not be called horror
Well they are more than that
how so
They thrill you you know keep you tense
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see there making a sequel to Blade Runner?
After all this time?!
Yup.
Is Ford doing it?
Yup. Scott is directing too.
I never watched the first one.
What?!
I tried, I just couldn't get into it.
We are watching this tonight!
Fine....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
Yes I do.
What is a good one you saw recently?
I saw The Shallows.
Who is in that?
Blake Lively.
Oh is that about the shark?
Yes it is.
Seems interesting.
I highly recommend it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think one of my favourite Stephen King book adaptations is Pet Sematery.
Is that why your pet graveyard in the backyard is called that?
That's where I got the inspiration, yep. And I named my grey cat Church just like the cat in the story.
No kidding! Was he grey just like that cat?
He was indeed, though that's as far as the resemblance goes. He never came back more viscious than before.
Hmm, I never read that book. I usually prefer the movie adaptations anyway. Especially in the thriller genre.
Why's that?
Well I'm just not as easily scared when I read something versus when I see it, you know?
Yeah. As great as Stephen King is at giving imagery there are some things in movies you just can't get from books.
Like the creep factor in a person's voice, and the selection of music! I think Pet Sematery, Misery and Children of the Corn are good examples.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
I would have to say Behind the Mask.
I haven't heard about that movie.  What's it about?
It's a mockumentary that plays on the trops of classic horror films.  The setting is a college film crew is interviewing a potential psycho kill who is prepping hsi next big kill.
That sounds kinds messed up.
It is, but in a funny way.  The movie has a lot of dark humor.  What's your favorite thriller movie?
I'd have to say it would be Inception.
Oooo, good choice.  That movie is awesome.
I know right? The special effects, acting, and that ending.  Holy crap.
I know! I still don't know if he was asleep at the end or if it was real.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food

It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie The Witch that came out last year?
Oh yeah, I wanted to see it badly after I saw the trailer
so what do you think
I think it's scary in a total different way, and it has some religious implications to it
oh yeah, what was that?
I think the isolated environment may indicate what would happen to some very devoted religious people if they're separated from the rest of the society
what would happen?
it would drive them crazy
sounds depressing
yeah, that's the underlying tone, not many people noticing it anyway
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Life?
No.
It's like Alien meets Gravity.
Was Sandra Bullock in it?
No, Jake Gillenhall and Ryan Reynolds.
He was good in Deadpool.
That is true.
Was Life good?
It was OK. Pretty much what You'd expect.
I'll watch it on video.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Alfred HItchcock was the greatest creator of thriller movies ever.  Were you a fan of HItchcock?
I'm not sure i'd call him the greatest, but I will say he is certainly among the best.  He was a genius, no doubt about it.
I'll never forget the first time i saw "the Birds."  I've never been so frightened watching a movie.
That was a great movie, but to me "Psycho" was HItchcock's best.  That was incredibly scary.
"Pyscho" was scary, but i think i give the edge to "the Birds" because it was in color.  I've always had a problem getting involved with black and white films.
It's interesting you say that; i always thought the fact that "Pyscho" was in black and white actually added to the tension.
Do you remember any of the sequels to "Psycho?" I think i saw one of them; it was awful.
I think there were three "Psycho" sequels and i saw all of them.  I'll tell you the truth...they were all terrible.  But i think everyone had false expectations in feelling they could be even half as good as the original.
Did you know that when "Psycho" first opened in the theatres in 1960, people were not allowed into the theatre after the film had started?
Now that you mention it, i did read that somewhere.  HItchcock got some good publicity out of that.  He wanted everyone to watch every second of it; once it started you couldn't get in.  great strategy !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the John Wick movies?
No, they any good.
Well, the first one, called John Wick was great. Lots of action and a good story.
WHat;s it about.
This guy, he was like a hitman, but he fell in love. So he left it. But then his wife dies.
Woah, isn't that kind of a spoiler?
No, it happens in the first few minutes. So he's real sad, but his wife got him a  dog.
Awww, that's something.
And any way, these Russian mobsters mess with him and they soon find out he's the wrong guy to mess with.
That sounds good. I think I will see it. But don't tell me any more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The movie "It" by Stephen King is coming to the theater it is a remake.
I saw the old version, it was pretty good.
The old movie "It was on TV it is really scary.
There is a new movie coming out called"Wish Upon", it look like a good movie.
I saw the trailer, I am going to see that when it comes out.
The are a lot of great movies coming out this summer, like"Saw" and "Friday the 13th.
I know, and I am going to see them all when they come to the theater.
Do you like Zombie movies?
Yes, I like zombie movies, but I do not see any new ones coming to the theater.
I like zombie and werewolf movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any really good classic thriller movies?
Yes, I really liked Jaws
You mean the one made in 1975
yes that's the one, directed by Stephen Speilberg
I love his movies, I don't think he ever made a bad movie
I agree, I have seen plenty of his movies.
I will have to watch Jaws tonight
I think you will really enjoy it
I do like a good scare
There is plenty of jumpy moments in that film
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched The Conjuring again. It had been a while since I'd seen it and it was just as good as before.
I need to watch that again.
Yeah, I watched it with my boyfriend in order to prepare for The Conjuring 2!
Oh yeah, didn't that just come out on HBO?
Yep, we've been waiting for it to be released on there. So now we can watch it!
Are there any new horror movies coming out in theaters?
Yeah, there are a couple this summer and then a few more in the Fall.
Annabelle: Creation is coming out in August, I think. Isn't that part of The Conjuring franchise?
Yes! And it's the sequel to Annabelle.
Have you seen the preview for the remake of Flatliners?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your thoughts on the old thriller When A Stranger Calls?
I really liked it.
Yes,it's a good thriller.
It was made in 1979 right?
Yes it was.
Charles Durning was in it.
Yes he was.
Wasn't Carol Kane in it too?
She was in it,yes.
Just a real good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like older movies?
Not really, how about you?
Not particularly, but there is one from 1976 that is stellar.
What is the name?
It is called Taxi Driver.
I have heard of that.
The reason you have heard of it, is because it is an awesome thriller.
Oh really?
Yes it builds from the beginning to the end and is quite thrilling.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever end up seeing that movie, "Split"?
No, I think it might really freak me out. Is that the movie about the guy with split personalities?
Yeah, and he kidnaps these girls and his various personalities torment them.
But wasn't one personality trying to save them?
Yes, and they were definitely fooled at first. But his other personalities always take over before they can be rescued by that particular one.
That is so scary. Do you think it's realistic?
Oh, no. Not at all. I think the disorder is very real, but it is sort of a far reach.
That makes me feel better about seeing it. Who plays the main character?
James McAvoy is the lead character. He is absolutely brilliant in it.
Wow, he is an awesome actor. I'm definitely going to check it out now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished watching a really good thriller by Hitchcock!
Oh, what was it, and who were the actors?
It's called "Rear Window", and it stars Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly, and Raymond Burr! I was literally "spellbound" by this one!
Oh, stop with the Hitchcock puns! Should I watch it? I do so love Jimmy Stewart.
Yes, the plot is pretty thick on this one. Jimmy Stewart is a retired photographer who has broken his leg, and is stuck in his apartment.
What? It all takes place in one location?
Yes, but he can see out of his window into the courtyard of his apartment complex. He thinks he sees the guy across the way killing and disposing of his invalid wife!
So how do Grace Kelly come into this? I mean sure, she's beautiful to look at...
She helps Jimmy Stewart's character outwit Raymond Burr's villian by sneaking into his apartment and spying on him. It's really suspenseful when she get trapped in Burr's apartment and he come home to find her there!
Well, anything that has Princess Grace in it is something I'd be glad to take a look at. And Hitchcock, well, say no more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Thriller movie?
I really like The Eye, have you seen it?
No, who was in it?
It starred Jessica Alba.
Hmm, I still dont think I've heard of it. Have you seen The Hills Have Eyes?
I loved that movie!
Me too. I think it could've been loosely based on real events.
What do you mean?
Well think about all the nuclear testing that went on, is it really that hard to imagine a scenario playing out like that?
I guess you could be right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have  you had the  chance to  see  the  Jane doe  movie ?
is it  very  suspenseful ?
It is  predictable  but  i think it has  a  few  good  turns .
Is  it  very gory ?
There is one  scene  where  they  cut her open  and pull her  skin  back  thats  pretty  brutal .
Did  she  live thru  that ?
Jane  actually  starts  as a  dead  body in the  mourge .
So its more  about  finding out  who she is ?
Yes and  what  killed her  which  is where the  twist  comes in .
I might  have to  check that one out  is it in redbox  yet ?
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is a good movie out called" The Hollow".
I heard of that movie, it sounds like a good movie to see.
I going to see it tonight with a friend.
I am to stay home and watch the movie"The Howling" on TV that is a really scary movie.
I saw that movie, is it about a bunch of werewolves in this community?
Yes !  It is like the movie called "American Werewolf in London".
Yea, that was a cool movie, with all those special effects.
That movie called" Blood and Chocolate is good too.
I like the movie "Silver Bullet" that was a good werewolf movie.
I have seen a couple of great werewolf movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are any new thriller or horror movies coming out this week?
No not this week.
Well that's a bummer.
Yeah but that new movie Death Pool came out last week I think.
And what is that movie about?
I want to say that a young kid almost drowns to death during his childhood and when he gets older he has flashbacks of the event and he turns into a serial killer.
Well that sounds dramatic.
Ya I know. But hey, it does sound pretty exciting.
Do you want to go see it with me sometime this weekend?
Sounds good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The last thriller that I saw was Gone Girl.
OH that was a great movie.
I agree but the ending left me wanting to know more.
Yes I would say I agree.
I enjoyed the characters though.
It was good how they took the perspective of both people.
I though that too it kept you in suspense.
That's what a good thriller will do.
I felt this movie was a lot like the book.
I will have to read it to see that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Action films have violence and strong heroes, while thrillers have suspense and innocents in jeopardy. Is Taken action or suspense?
That's easy. All three Taken movies are both; they are action thrillers.
I get you. They're action movies with a strong hero, Liam Neeson as the dad--
Yes. And thrillers with a vulnerable innocent, Maggie Grace, as his estranged daughter Kim.
Then there are the villains, the evil human traffickers. Unfortunately, the films stereotyped these villains terribly.
They did, and it's jarring. On the other hand, there is the action movie element of beautiful scenery in foreign lands--
Mixed with the thriller element of tight, dark, threatening scenes.
The action hero shows near superhuman fighting skills--
While the thriller lead endures unbelievable torment without giving in.
Of course. It's an action thriller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about that new M. Night Shymalan movie?
Which one are you referring to?
I think it's called Split.
That was awful.
Really?  I thought it was kind of creative.
I'm so sick of him trying to do twist endings.  It's comedic really.
This one wasn't really a twist, it was just surprising that it was actually true.
Nah, sorry, it was garbage.  Just my opinion.
Do you think they'll make another Unbreakable with the reveal at the end?
Doubtful.  That ship sailed long ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the movie the Dark Knight would be considered a thriller movie?
Yes I think so, haven't you seen it?
Oh I have but wasn't sure.
My husband LOVED that movie especially when it first came out.
Mine too, he's a huge Batman fan.
Not to mention, Heath Ledger did an amazing job in that movie.
He really did.
Did you know that he passed away before the movie was done filming?
Oh wow I didn't realize.
I know, so very sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Misery last night.
I read the book but did not see the movie.
It was pretty close to the book.
Who's in it?
Kathy Bates, James Caan, even Lauren Bacall.
Wow.  Who was the best?
Kathy Bates, beyond a doubt.
Does she break the writer's ankles?
Yes, but she gets it in the end.
Thank God!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Seven?
Yeah it was pretty good.  That was a total mind bend.
Yeah, both Brad Pitt and Keven Spacey at their best.
The ending was classic too.  Who doesn't know "What's in the box?"
Yeah, often copied by people.  Even when joking around outside of media.
That's what happens with classic movies.
I know, the movie had such a great plot.
I agree, killing the people in the same way of their deadly sin.
Yep, technically he won in the end.
Because Brad Pitt killed him.  With wrath like he wanted.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Shutter Island?
I think so? What's it about.
Leonardo DiCaprio visits a mental home.
Oh wait, I know that one.
Did you like it?
NO, not at all. It barely counts as a thriller.
Why?
You could see the twist coming a mile away.
I didn't see it coming!
Seriously? Like an hour into the movie it was obvious he was actually in prison.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the first Cloverfield movie?
Yes but I liked the second one better
The second one?
Yes, 10 Cloverfield Lane.
I watched that. It was probably one of the stranger movies I seen.
Why do you say that?
It was like two different movies in one.
Oh with the kidnapping and then the aliens.
yes, I didn't see the last part coming.
I didn't either. It was one of the stranger movies I have ever watched.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller?
I always liked Joy Ride.  I know it's older, but I always love watching it.
That's the one with Paul Walker right?
Yes.  I thought it kept me on edge the entire movie.
I liked Paul Walker in the Skulls.  That was a good thriller too.
Which one do you like better?
Definitely the Skulls.
I think the Skulls is a good mix of mystery and thriller.
It is.  Have you seen The Hunger Games?  That's kind of a triller.
I have.  I thought the books were so much better though.  The directors could have done a much better job making the movies more thrilling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Equalizer before?
No, I haven't.  What type of movie is it?
It is a thriller and suspense movie. Denzel Washington play the avenging angel and helps Chloë Grace Moretz's character get out of a bad situation.
Avenging angel, Denzel must have really done a nice job in that one.
With his set of formidable skills, Denzel's character comes out of self-imposed retirement  to help those that need him.
When did that one come out?
I think it originally aired in 2014.
You saw it again recently on Netflix?
Yes I did.  I ordered it. It came in the mail on DVD.
Sounds cool. I will watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see American Psycho with Christian Bale?
Yes that's one of my favorite movies. He definitely was psycho in that movie.
I definitely liked him better in that than I did The Dark Knight.
Oh yeah that's for sure. I love that he would play Phil Collins whenever he got ready to kill.
I know right! I wonder how Phil Collins felt about that.
I'm sure he didn't feel too bad. He got paid royalties off of it.
Oh of course how could I forget that. I'm sure he was fine with it.
Did you think he was ever going to have a change of heart while you were watching it?
At one point I did, when he was confessing.
Turns out he was just having a meltdown but he went right back to his old self.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best Thriller movie?
I would go with something classic.
Such as?
Silence of the Lambs.
I do not think I have seen that one.
With Anthony Hopkins?
I know of it, never saw it.
It is nuts. He plays a cannibal.
Is that the one where he wears the mask?
Yes, and the detective has to figure out how to stop him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What thriller did you feel could have been better?
No Country for Old Men.
Really, I think that won an oscar.
I just thought the book was so much better.
I did not know there was a book first.
Yes the novel was by Cormac McCarthy.
I don't think I like him much. theone book I read was so boring.
Well he is a hard read at times. But no country for old men was an amazing book.
Well Hollywood doesn't turn just any book into a movie.
True, I did like Josh Brolin's performance . I just prefer the book strongly overall.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name the best thriller ever made?
I would have to say The Shining.
Really? I would consider that to be a horror movie.
You could be right. How about Vanilla Sky
Is that the one with Tom Cruise?
Yea, him and Cameron Diaz.
That was a decent movie actually.
I think it is very underrated in terms of being a great movie.
It was good, but not one of the best ever!
You should watch it again, you might change your mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any good thrillers come out recently?
We can watch Get Out, that new movie!
What's that movie about?
A black guy visits his white girlfriend's family and suspects evil things are going down
That sounds weird. I dont like it.
We can watch Secret Window with Johnny Depp
What happens in that movie?
There's a schizo author guy who thinks someone is after him
Where does it take place?
In a secluded cabin in a small town. Creepy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Inception?
Yes it was a great thriller. Very brilliant writing and plot.
Yes I agree except I wasn't able to really understand it.
Oh you're not alone, a lot of people did.
I know one thing, it's definitely a movie that had people talking.
That's true. Another thriller I really like is Seven.
The one with Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.
That's the one. It was a little dark for me but I liked it.
It's true that it was really dark. I couldn't watch it more than once.
Me neither. That twist at the end gave me nightmares for days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite director of thriller movies?
It would have to be Alfred Hitchcock.
I totally agree! What's your favorite Hitchcock movie?
I think it's probably Strangers On A Train.
Why is that?
Because of the twists and turns. You never really know where it's going.
Oh, I love movies like that! The ones that keep you guessing.
Hitchcock was the master of that, he made so many great suspense movies.
And liked that he always made a cameo in his movies.
And in Strangers on a Train, his daughter has a role. She was a pretty good actress!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Coen Brothers film.
No Country for Old Men.
Why?! It was so creepy.
It's just so different from anything else they've done.
No kidding!
Did you know it won an Oscar?
That movie?!
Best picture.
Wonders never cease.
Ha! Well I liked it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller about serial killers?
That's a really tough question, I would have to think about it.
Well, anyway, mine is Silence of The Lambs.
Wow, that is a great one. It's really intense too.
Yeah, it is. Do you remember the scene where he beats the two guards and escapes?
Of course! That part was crazy.
He literally took one of the guys faces off and wore it.
Yeah, and the paramedics actually took him out thinking he was one of the guards.
That was so ingenious and disgustingly perfect.
Yeah the main character in that movie is truly insane.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Blue Velvet?
Of course I've seen it, I love David Lynch.
I figured you would've. Really neat that Kyle McLaughlin and Laura Dern are in it, since they do so much with Lynch.
Yeah two of his standby actors
Where would you rank it among Lynch films?
Near the top honestly, I'm partial towards The Elephant Man and Fire Walk with me since I love Twin Peaks so much, but it would be right behind those two.
My list would best be the same, but Blue Velvet would be first and those other two second and third.
Did you know Blue Velvet had really mixed reviews?
I didn't, but it doesn't surprise me. Lynch is unique enough that not everyone will get it so to speak.
Yeah I know Ebert for example absolutely hated it, his loss I say!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Mission Impossible movies?
for sure, how could I miss Tom Cruise's stun, it's too visually exhilarating
that's for sure, especially the one where he's climbing the tallest tower in the world--Raj Khalifa
oh, that one really got me on the edge of seat, especially later I realized it was real stunt, not CG
yea, Tom Cruise always tend to do stunt himself, and for that I really respect him
you know in the next movie, he jumped into a water cooling server center to hihack their data?
yeah, he was blacked out when holding breath for too long
I read news later that he was actually trained to hold breath more than 3 minutes under water by some specialists from SEAL
you mean the SEAL from USA special force?
yea
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Fugitive?
The movie, sure.
What did you think I was talking about?
Well, the movie was based on a series that used to play.
Oh, really?  I didn't know that.
Yeah, it was on back years and years ago.
Do you know when it ran?
Back in the sixties, I think.
Was it good?
I don't know.  I never watched it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite director?
M. Night Shyamalan.
You have got to be kidding!
He does some really good thrillers.
He's had a few....
The Sixth Sense is probably my favorite.
It was good, but the best?
One of my favorites.
But you can only watch it once.
I've seen it a couple times, but you're right. Once you know the plot twist, it's a little redundant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last thriller movie you saw?
that would have to be Hunger games Mockingjay II
I can't believe Peeta was trying to kill Katniss
I know, and President Alma Coin was so mean.
I know right! When Katniss shot her in the end a cheered!
me too, I was really upset when they killed Katniss' little sister Prim
Yeah, but it was sweet when Petta was planting the prim rose at the end
yeah it was. I really didn't expect Petta and Katniss to have kids.
Yeah that was kind weird. What a messed up world
I know. But what an action packed series
XXXXXXXXXXX
Halloween is still one of favorite thriller movies.
That was just downright scary.
It scared me.
Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic in it.
She was great.
Just to hear the name Michael Myers gives me chills.
John Carpenter did a great job directing.
Yes he did.
That was made in 1978.
Didn't realize how long ago it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Kristen Stewart was in Panic Room?
I didn't know that.  I'm not a fan of hers though.
Do you remember the movie?
I have seen it.   I can kind of tell you what it's about.
I guess you wouldn't have known her enough to spot her.
No, it was before Twilight and everything.
Yeah, it was early in her career.
Who else was in that movie?
I think it was Jodie Foster.
Okay, that sounds right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Do you know if there's any good thrillers playing at the cinema right now?
I think The Mummy's still playing, if you haven't seen that yet.
I haven't! That's the new Tom Cruise movie, right?
Yes. It's also got Russell Crowe playing a character called Dr. Henry Jekyll, and Annabelle Wallis playing a monster-hunting archaeologist called Jennifer Halsey.
Sounds good! But do you think I'll be able to follow the plot even if I haven't seen the previous Mummy movies?
Definitely, it's standard. Tom Cruise plays a soldier of fortune called Nick Morton, who goes around the Middle East looting ancient treasures. He digs up the wrong tomb, and thrilling adventures ensue.
Haha, got it. Well, it sounds good! I love anything that involves ancient mythology and some daring escapism.
Me too. Plus, Russell Crowe is one of my favorites. I love anything he does.
Agreed, me too. I'm not much of a Tom Cruise fan, but I'll see anything with Russell Crowe.
Great! Let's find a time to go this week! If we go to an afternoon showing, it probably won't give us nightmares.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is good friend
Nothing much
Yeah i am just sitting here
Well thats cool i am bout to put on a movie
Ooh what kind
I am thinking something thrilling
What you got in mind
I think i am gonna watch the silence of the lambs
That is thrilling and creepy
But it is a good movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any awesome thrillers lately? I know you've always got the know!
Ummm, let me think for a moment... I did see the Fate of the Furious.
Oh! Vin Diesel! I like!
Yeah, man, it was awesome.
I'm sure they've upped the stunts in this one.
They did. There are some crazy parts. I won't spoil it for you though!
Just tell me... Will I be amazed?
Oh, definitely. It's just amazing.
Would you see it again? I know you're a fan of The Rock, right?
I am indeed! Hit me up if you do end up going, for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Friday the 13th movie?
I don't really know.
I like them all, personally.
Friday the 13th, that's the one with Freddy Kruger, right?
Yeah that's his movies.
Those movies all blend together.
Did you know Johnny Depp was in one?
No, really, I didn't know that.
Yeah it's the second one, I think.
Man, he's been in a lot of movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Thriller movies?
Yes I do.
What is your favorite?
I like Ex Machina.
Oh with Alicia Vikander?
Yes.
I like that movie too.
It is super interesting.
I love being at the edge of my seat.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any thriller movies lately?
Yes, I did see that new movie Life with Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds.
Oh, I wanted to see that one.  How was it?
I expected it to be a lot better, it wasn't even Jake Gyllenhaal's best work.  I hate Noctural Animals as well but at least he acted his heart out in it.
Nocturnal Animals WAS a weird movie.  What didn't you like about Life?
It felt like it dragged on, and then the ending became predictable about halfway thought the movie.
I hate when I can guess the movie endings, I love being surprised.
If you like being suprised you should watch some M. Night Shyamalan movies.
Which one do you recommend?
His older ones were great like Sixth Sense and The Village, but he recently made a new one called Split which was very popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how about I saw that new movie with the chick from the Fast and Furious movies...
What chick?
I believe her name is Michelle Rodriguez.
Is she the one that dated the character played by Vin Diesel?
Yeah that's her.
Do you remember what the name of this new movie was?
Yeah, It was called "The Assignment".
Would you recommend it?
Somewhat. It was alright, but the movie line is a bit controversial.
Awesome, that makes it even better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that movie with Liam Neeson in it?
That's most unhelpful.
The one where they kidnap his daughter.
Oh, you mean Taken.
Oh yeah.  He's such a thug in that movie.
His whole "I don't know who you are..." quote is just money.
It helps make his character that more threatening.
You should know not to miss with Liam Neeson?
Did you ever see the sequels?
Nah, why bother when this one was all you need?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wished there was something decent on to watch!
We could just stream a movie if you want.
That is fine, I want to watch a thriller.
How about Cold Creek Manor?
Never heard of it, anyone famous in it?
Sure, Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone are in it.
Wow, with them in it I am guessing it is pretty good.
That is some good star power there.
I think we should give it a try!
Sounds good, I hope it is a good one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Saw with my brother last night.  I haven't seen it in forever.
I haven't seen that in years either.
Did you like it?
I think I did.  I don't think I'd want to watch it now though.
It's pretty gory.
Yeah, there are movies that are worse.  This one was about as bad as I could handle.
Did you like the sequels?
I didn't see all of them.
I have them in case you'd want to borrow them.
I probably will pass on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Zodiac?
No I missed that one.
I watched it twice.
Oh really, its that good?
Yes its really great.
What makes it so good.
It is truly thrilling.
Ok that is a fun watch then.
Yes, Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job.
I like him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thriller movie?
The Sixth Sense
I see dead people!
A dank meme for sure!
Yea, but like, that was even before memes
Like over 9000?
Yea, but not quite THAT old!
Any classic movie that now has a meme is certainly a good movie!
That's a good rule!
For sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that M. Night movie where the kids go to see their grandparents?
No. I haven't watched a movie of his in awhile.
I know me either but I checked this one out randomly one day.
Is it any good? Lady in the water was a real bummer.
It's actually pretty good!
Old people creep me out so I might like it.
What about the new new one?
Split? I heard it has a twist ending.
I mean all of his movies do.
Yeah but this one is supposed to be really good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Oldboy?
No, what is that about.
It is a South Korean film that is intense.
What is it about?
A guy spends time in prison and searches for someone, its great.
That sounds exciting.
Yes it is a suspenseful thriller, for sure.
I like this genre.
Me too, you should watch it, it is a complex movie too, its great.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you like to make some popcorn and watch a movie?
Sure, what kind of movie are we going to watch?
I have the perfect one in mind. It is called Sleeping With The Enemy.
Sounds interesting. Who is in it?
It stars Julia Roberts, one of your favirotes!
Great, so what is it about?
Roberts stars as an abused wife who goes on the run in search of a better life.
This sounds like a movie that I am going to enjoy.
I hope So! It is a movie that will make you not want to miss a second of it.
Great, let's get it started!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just recently saw the movie Se7en and I am very conflicted.
What are you conflicted about? Are you upset that there wasn't a plot twist at the end?
Well I guess, yeah I am. I was getting really into the lives of the two detectives, especially Brad Pitt's character. At the end of the film, I was hoping that there would be a plot twist, and that the wife wasn't actually killed, but I knew that wouldn't be the case.
It's a fantastic ending. Idealism is corrupted and proved almost as irrational as psychosis.
Can you eleborate on that? Help me understand because I'm not entirely sure why things happened the way they did in the movie.
It's actually pretty simple, Brad Pitt proves Kevin Spacey right, but Morgan Freeman rededicates himself to justice, so maybe he was wrong too. I suppose the point is that anyone can succumb to dark impulses, not just someone who is insane.
Ok what is seemed like Kevin Spacey's character was almost punishing Brad Pitt for a Sin that he was going to commit in the future, which I think sort of plays against his "holy" reasoning for the murders he committed.
You're thinking way too much into the script. Keep it simple, The only reason this is sticking out in your mind is because there isn't a solution.
Why didn't Brad Pitt just kill himself at the end?
Brad Pitt faces a choice between a vengeance that is literally nothing but wrath, or a moral high ground that still feels like failure. The way Pitt performed that scene I believed that though he understood this choice, he could only kill Kevin Spacey and not himself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watched Prisoners?
Yes, I seen it the day it came out.
It was one of those movies that made your skin crawl.
I agree! I came out of the movies feeling like I needed a shower.
There were a few twist that I didn't see coming.
Me too. I thought Jake and Hugh did amazing work.
Yes, there back and forth made the movie.
The premise was dark though even more if you have kids.
Yes, I probably would have done what Huge did in the movie.
I think most people would if pushed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which movie did you pick up for movie night?
Eyewitness. It's really good.
Never heard of it. Who's in it?
Sigourney Weaver in one of her best performances.
What's this movie about?
Weaver's playing a reporter who has an obsessed viewer. Both of them get wrapped up in a murder mystery.
Sounds interesting. I guess I'll enjoy it.
I've seen it a dozen times. You'll like it. It's very character defining.
I'll be the judge of that. Who directed it?
Peter Yates, the same man who directed that Steve McQueen movie you like so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Psycho for my film class.
That was indeed a classic.
Yes.  Anthony Perkins was really great.  He had nervous energy.
I liked Martin Balsam as the investigator.
Nobody could forget the shower scene!
Goodbye, Janet Leigh!
Vera Miles wasn't bad in the movie as well.
She doesn't get the juicy parts, though.
Hitchcock always liked the cool blondes.
Grace Kelly in Rear Window.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The mateix is such a good thriller movie
I enjoy those movies
They are so wierd

That movie was a little confusing
Yea it was a little bit

I saw Gone Girl.
I read the book but did not see the movie.
It was pretty close to the book.
I heard the writer wrote the screenplay.
Gillian Flynn, right.
Did you like Ben Affleck?
Oh, yes, hard not to.
How was Rosamund Pike?
A purely evil bitch.
That's how she was in the book.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Momento?
Oh my God yes, hardly anyone knows that movie but it was great.
I know what you mean.  They used the plot device of an unreliable witness to mastery.
Yeah, and how that girl tricked him into killing his friend the cop.
And how that cop was getting him to kill other people.
One of my favorite lines from the movie was a funny one though.
Yeah, when he was like "Why am I chasing this guy" and he tries to shoot him.
Then he's like "Oh no, he's chasing me"
Yeah that was good.
His tattoos were pretty good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thriller movie?
Minority Report
I don't think I've heard of that one.
It's really good. Stars Tom Cruise and deals with future crimes.
Hmmm, sounds interesting.
Yes, it's a create look at the future. I really enjoyed it.
What year did it come out?
I believe around 2002.
Ah okay, I wasn't really into movies that year.
Definitely check it out and watch out for your eyes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what would you say is your favorite thriller movie?
Gosh, that's a tough one. Do you mean like a psychological thriller?
Sure, or any kind.
I tend to like classics, like Alfred Hitchcock movies.
Oh sure, Psycho is a classic.
Yes, but I also like Rear Window and North by Northwest.
Those are more like mysteries or suspense movies. I tend to like psychological thrillers, like Saw, Seven, and The Shining.
Yes, I like movies that make you think.
Or ones with surprise plot twists or endings.
Oh, yes, like Bound or Unbreakable. They were great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like war movies?
Yes I do.
There is one that I love a lot.

It is so thrilling.

A crime thriller by Quentin Tarantino

It is a great movie

When Tim Roth confesses he is a cop.
Thanks for ruining the ending.
You asked.
I love crime thrillers
This is one of the best
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go see 47 Meters Down soon, it came out recently.
What is that movie about?
It is about sisters that go on vacation, and decide to dive in a cage to see sharks.
And I am sure it doesn't go as planned!
Exactly, you guessed it!
Who plays in it?
Mandy Moore and Claire Holt are in it, Chris Johnson, and Matthew Modine as well.
How many stars did it get for reviews?
Three stars recently, but no higher.
I think I will wait for that one to come out on DVD.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Jurassic Park was a pretty good thriller back in the 90's.
Nothing like big, killer dinosaurs to keep you on your toes.
That was such a huge spectacle back then.
It was one of those quintessential summer movies.
Spielberg delivered the goods for sure.
The movie was truly scary.  I mean, what would you do?
I'd run from the dinosaurs.
I would have just hidden from them.
Easier said then done when they could just smash your building.
Good point.  Maybe I shouldn't visit the island.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have  you seen the  new  Eli roth   film  Clown ?
I have not  is  it  very  scary ?
It has more of a  comedy feel in the  start of  it .
So is it more like  idle hands ?
It  does have some of that dark  humor  to it   just not as  well  portrayed .
So  what is  the main  story in  it ?
It describes  a  man that  slowly becomes  a demon  clown  and  starts to  eat  children .
Is the  special  effects  good in it ?
I thought the make up on the clown was  very well done .
so  i  take it  he really looked like  a demon clown then
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love thriller movies. Anything that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
Have you seen "Don't Breathe?" It was probably one of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen?
What's it about?
It's about some kids who break into a blind veteran's house and get trapped in there. I don't want to say anymore.
Sounds creepy. Have you seen "Hush?"
No. What's that one about?
It's about this deaf girl who's a writer, so she moves to the country and then this guy tries to come to her house and kill her.
Cool. Did you ever see "The Others."
Yes! That was an awesome one.
My favorite is "A Perfect Murder."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Taken?
Not really.  I'm not into that kind of movie.
Oh, I loved it.  Liam Neeson was awesome in it.
I really don't care for him either.
So, I guess you didn't see the sequel.
Nope.  The first one was enough.
It really had me on edge.
I mean, I guess it was exciting, but I don't care for it.
Do you like anything else Liam Neeson is in?
I honestly couldn't tell you anything else he is in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We watched a pretty good thriller the other day.
I LOVE thrillers, what was it.
It was "Kidnap". It had Halle Berry in it. It was pretty good. Not the best I've ever seen, but still good.
Was it better than "Get Out"?
They are very different. Get out is a little weirder. I wasn't sure if I like that one. It felt like they were trying to make a political commentary a little bit and I despise that in movies.
Hmm, I din't get that...
It feels like they don't make good thrillers anymore. They are mostly horror and I don't like horror.
The new one "Baby Driver" that's coming out looks good.
Oh yeah, I really want to see that. It has Jamie Foxx in it right?
Yeah. It should be good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of a film called "Vertigo"? I was thinking of watching it again and thought you might like it.
Tell me more - who's in it, and what's it about? I might want to join you.
Do you remember the film we watched last week, called "Bell,Book. and Candle"?
Yes, that chick put a spell on Jimmy Stewart. That was Kim Novak, right?
Yep, and she's plenty witchy in this Hitchock thriller. And Jimmy Stewart is in it too.
Okay, okay, give me the plot line You've got my attention.
Kim Novak plays the wife of on of Jimmy's old friends. There's something seriously wrong with her, and the guy asks Jimmy to watch her for a while.
You mean like tail her? What is he, some kind of detective?
Yes, and one who has just recovered from a serious fall. That's why it's called "Vertigo", and it's got everything- haunting. possession, romance, suspense, you name it!
I think I remember it. She was possessed by the spirit of Carlotta - and yes, it's a great flick, let's watch it now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes, actually I just watched the movie Taken.
I saw that movie at least 2 times and enjoyed it very much.
Yeah, I really liked it. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
Liam Neeson played a great part as the girls father.
He is an amazing actor. I am sure I will watch it again in the future.
The director Pierre Morel did a great job and I would be interested in other movies that he directed.
I did not know who the director was, but they really did a good job on that movie.
You definitely can't turn this movie off until it ends.
That is right, you need to know the final outcome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Black Swan?
I haven't. I heard it's good though.
Natalie Portman is incredible in that movie.
Isn't she a ballerina in it?
Yeah. She becomes completely obsessed with artistic perfection.
Was it scary?
It was very chilling. It had a high sense of realism which made it even scarier.
I love movies like that. Does she go crazy?
Very much so. She even starts to hallucinate and imagine things.
That's awesome. I'm going to have to watch it now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the old thriller movies?
I like any thriller movies.
What do you think about Psycho?
Now that's a classic thriller.
Alfred Hitchcock was great.
He made a lot of thriller movies.
Anthony Perkins was creepy in Psycho.
Janet Leigh was great too.
The Bates Motel sign is classic.
Yes it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any thriller movies lately?
Not really. The last thriller movie I saw was split.
Didn't it come out in 2016?
Well its official release was in January 2017.
So who was in it?
James McAvoy was the main character.
Wow I like that actor. Tell me what happened.
Well James held three girls hostage in his basement. According to his doctor, he had a mental problem.
Did he kill the girls?
Only one girl survived the incidence.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When these kind of movies are too scary, I have to hide my eyes behind my hands..
I love the scary kind the best. Some of my favorites this year are The Mummy or Alien: Covenant. I may jump in my seat during scary parts but I love them.
I prefer the type of thriller like Hell or High Water. It had amazing action and great suspense.
Wasn't that movie up for Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards?
Yes, although it did not win, it still was amazing.
I agree.  I like that kind of thriller. Some of my favorites has been the Bourne series.
I loved Matt Damon in those movies. He plays an extremely convincing Bourne.
How about Nocturnal Animals? Did you see it last year? It also was up for an Academy Award.
No  but I read reviews on Amy Adams' performance. All the critics raved about it.
She was so good that I really got caught up in the plot. Once again, I jumped in my seat when it was scary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what was a classic movie?  Jurassic Park.
I agree, it totally changed the summer blockbuster.
Yes, the raptors were pretty cool.
The special effects were all together.  Plus a pretty solid plot line.
I agree, I was a young pre-teen boy at the time.  So I remember the triple Jurassic burger from MacDonald's or Burger King.
Yeah I do too.  That was before they had triples all the time.
You know what else was cool in that movie?  In the beginning when they were digging up those bones.
Yeah, it was like the calm before the storm.
A good funny part of the movie though.  When that girl was going nuts over the extinct plant.

XXXXXXXXXXX
I still cannot believe they left the universe of i robot where it was
I know it was ripe for more
It would have been cool
But they have to keep will smith

XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Inception?
Yes.
What did you think of the ending?
Ahh, if the spinning top.
Right...what did it mean?
Well, that's part of the fun, isn't it?
Just tell me. I don't get it.
Hmm, looks like the whole "It's too smart for American audiences" may be true.
Hey! That's mean.
Fine. The top was HIS way of holding on. He's in the real world.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the movie The Birds?
What kind of movie is that?  A documentary?
No, it's a thriller.
How could birds be scary?
It's a Hitchcock film.
Oh, that explains it.  What goes on?
A woman goes to an island.  The island gets overrun by birds.
Do the birds have rabies or something?
Something along those lines.
Okay.  Now I'm interested!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you say is your all time favorite Thriller movie?
While I don't watch too many thrillers, one that comes to mind was Disturbia.
I have not seen that one.  Would you recommend it?
I absolutely would.  It was a 2007 movie starring Shia LeBeouf and Carrie-Anne Moss.
What was it about?
It was about a teen who finds out he lives next door to a killer, but no one believes him at first until it's too late.
That sounds pretty intense.  I know who Shia is but I don't know who Carrie-Anne Moss is.
She was the actress who played Trinity in 'The Matrix.'
Oh I see.  I do know her then.
She is a phenomenal actress.  You should definitely give Disturbia a shot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Usual Suspects probably has the best twist ending ever.
Ah yes, Keyser Soze.
It was pretty interesting to watch the story unfold.
I missed all the hints in that movie.
The cool thing is if you rewatch it, you'll catch nearly everything.
I've heard that, but haven't followed up on it.
It was kind of the movie that launched Bryan Singer's career too.
It was a good piece of filmmaking.
Give a lot of credit to the script.
Yep, awesome writing throughout.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Inception was a real mind trip
I really liked Leonardo Dicaprio's character
The whole storyline was so unique it kept me engaged
The ending was really good too.
Yea, I didnt see that coming
Seeing people's dreams and being able to change their minds is pretty cool
It would be a great super power
Maybe one day, we can do something like that with technlogy
Do you think their will be a sequel?
I don't know, it doesnt need one but it would be awesome to see some of the characters again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite thirller movie?
Probably The Machinist
Oh that's a good one!
Yea, I love Christian Bale's character in that one
He did such a good job!
Yea, it differed a lot from his other roles
You mean like compared to Batman
Exactly!
That's the sign of a great actor
I agree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen The Departed?
Is that the movie with Leo Dicaprio?
Yeah, he is in it.
That's my favorite movie with him! He is so real and I want to root for him to bad
I wish he got an Oscar for it! He should have won!
He played a good good guy and good bad guy too!
Oh yeah, he's a double agent right?
Yeah, he in the police force but has to become a gang member
is he the only double agent?
No, there's a mobster who is trying to be a cop!
XXXXXXXXXXX

Alfred Hitchcock.

Who are you talking about?
The guy who played in the Avengers.
Oh, Mark Ruffalo?
Yes, that is who i am talking about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch that newer Brad Anderson film.
I am not sure, who is in it?
It has Kate Beckinsile.
Is that the one set in the asylum?
Yes, Stonehurst asylum.
That was so scary!
His work reminds me of classic thrillers.
What else did he make?
He made one called "Rope", so scary.
I think I saw that one, it reminded me of the older film Vertigo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Anything good on tonight?
Yeah, I'm watching Hush. It's a thriller about a deaf woman who lives in the woods and someone is stalking her.
Oh, my sister watched that the other night! She loved it.
You should watch it! I don't usually recommend movies, especially thrillers, but it's so unique and well done.
Yeah it seems like it would be different from anything done before.
There is a great scene near the beginning, I won't spoil it for you, but it's one of the most impacting and climactic scenes I've ever seen.
Ooh, you're keeping me in suspense, now I have to see it.
Please do. It puts you kind of in the shoes of the deaf woman by eliminating sound in certain parts which I thought was very interesting.
That is a very scary position to be in.
Yeah, but you kind of see how it helps her in the end. I won't say any more than that for fear of giving spoilers.
XXXXXXXXXXX

What thriller movie stands out the most to you?
Se7en
Oh man, I totally forgot about that one.
Yeah, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman at their peak.
Yeah, that was one freaky movie as well.
Kevin Spacey as the killer was quite the twist at the end as well.
Yeah, he tricked Brad Pitt to committing the final sin.
Wasn't Gwyneth Paltrow his wife?
Yes, and she loses her head in the end
That's kind of a bad pun/joke
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best thriller of 1975?
Jaws
That is a great thriller
It might be the best ever made
The shark is really scary
I like how they hide him and don't show much of him
That is the key to the suspense in that film
The ending is even more suspenseful
Yeah, when the ship was sinking, I was on the edge of my seat.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like really smart movies?
Yes if they are entertaining.
Then you will like V for Vendetta.
What is it about?
It is a thrilling movie about revolution and so much more.
Wow that sounds interesting.

XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best Bruce Willis movie?
He has a number of good ones!

I would either say, "12 Monkeys" or "The Sixth Sense"
I haven't seen either of those.
Then you are in for a treat, because I have both on DVD!
Which should I watch first?
The Sixth Sense, unless you are a big Brad Pitt fan.
Why The Sixth Sense first?
Because moments after Bruce Willis drops his wedding ring, you will call me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Thriller movies from 1987 I'm gonna tell you about the movie called the Step Father my pal get ready for this Thriller story..
Cool i heard about the movie but don't know for sure if iv'e seen this type of Thriller movie maybe you haven't stated telling me about the movie yet.
Okay would you like me to get us a bite to snack on first there is some popcorn in the cabinet.
Sure get the popcorn and i will grab a soda from out the fridge then you can begin.
The movie is starring Jerry Blake but plays a role as the name of Terry a family working man. He happens to have a numerous of wives he married and then murders them.
Gosh you always get to see the good ones. This movie has made many continuous remakes right.
Yes but this Thriller from 1987 is one of the best at least i think so. He gets the children curious of him by acting a bit Psychotic.
That's right he don't want the wives friend's and kids to know who he really is and that he is a serial killer. He tricks them all into thinking he is a great man.
Sort of correct but however his lovely widow Susan Shelley hack and her daughter find out that he has continuously murdered past tense wives and after their marriage he tries to kill her but failed to succeed.
Great Thriller movie the kind people like to re watch repeats over and over let's do this again sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie identity?
That's the one with John Cusack right?
Yea, the one where he's a detective.
Yea, and he get's stuck at that motel, when all that bad stuff has to happen. Except I don't think he's a detective anymore.
Oh yea, like he used to be or something.
Yea. Because Ray Leota played a cop in that and he was pretty much in charge.
Oh yea I remember now.
That ending was really crazy.
Yea I never would have guessed about the split personalities.
Same here, I had to watch it twice just to really understand everything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
"Would you F@#$ me? I'd F@#$ me."
There is something wrong with you.
It's a quote from my favorite movie.
You're favorite movie is Silence of the Lambs?
Yeah, what's wrong with that? It's an amazing thriller.
It's just a disturbing thing to find out about your best friend.
Why do you think I'll eat your liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti?
Well now I do. Though I will admit that Anthony Hopkins was incredible in that movie.
He's great in all his movies, but he is outstanding as a serial killer.
I liked him better in Fracture, somehow he was scarier than when he was eating people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who makes the strangest thrillers?
I'd probably have to say David Lynch.
David Lynch, what did he do again?
He did Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive.
Oh, Mulholland Drive. I remember watching that one.
Yeah? What did you think?
To be honest, I didn't really understand it. Was part of it a dream?
It took me a second watch to fully get what was going on, but yes, it turns out that most of the movie is a dream.
I remember doing a lot of mental work and being frustrated despite getting really engaged in certain parts of the film.
It's a difficult film, but it rewards the repeat viewer
XXXXXXXXXXX
There was a thriller movie called Split that came out last year.  Did you get to see it?
No, I didn't get to see it yet.  I never seemed to have the time while it was out.
I haven't seen it yet either.  I wanted to go see it too. Who plays in it?
James McAvoy and Betty Buckley star in this thriller.
Also, I think the director is  M. Night Shyamalan.
He always does a beautiful job with his films.
I am a big fan of that director as well.
That one came out in what month?
January I believe is when it came out.
That one looks great.  I will rent it soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the movie 'Seven' the other day.
How did you like it?
It was pretty tense and brutal.
I agree with you, but I loved it.
I'm not sure how I feel yet, because I'm still quite shaken by some of the violence in it.
Yes, they really depicted some graphic stuff, and really went for gruesome reality.
I think the plot and story was dependent on being gritty like that.
Yes, because in the end we are supposed to question our society and the nature of ourselves.
Whatever the message was, I thought Morgan Freeman was very good in it.
He was the voice of reason, and his character calmed me down a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Shivers?
I don't think so. What was it about?
A guy creates a parasite creature that starts infecting people in an apartment building and making them deviants to reproduce itself.
Sounds like something I'd like. Who's in it?
The only star I recognized was Barbara Steele from the old Dark Shadows and Piranha.
The old one from the 70s?
Yes, she was one of the doctors.
That was a great movie!
I liked it too. It was much better than the one from a few years ago.
Yes, I only like thrillers too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
