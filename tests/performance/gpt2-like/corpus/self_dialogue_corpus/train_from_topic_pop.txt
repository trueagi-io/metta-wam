I really like pop music.  What do you think of pop music?
I really like it too.  I have for many years.
What is your favorite pop artist?
Oh, that's a hard question!  I like so many artists but I guess Ed Sheeran is my favorite.
What is your favorite Ed Sheeran song?
The new song called "Shape of you" is my favorite.
Is there any pop artists that have been around for longer than adecade that you like?
Yes!  I like Britney Spears.
What's your favorite Britney Spears song?
"Oops I did it again" is my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider Rihanna to be a pop artist?
I would consider her to be one.
Her most recent songs are more influenced by hip hop, but her older songs are more pop.
I agree. I love her older songs.
Me too. My favorite is Don't Stop The Music.
My favorite is Umbrella.
I love the music video for that song
Me too, and I love Jay Z's intro in the beginning.
Really? A lot of people don't like that part of the song.
Hm. I've never heard that, but I just think it's nice to see artists working together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What album is better? U2's Pop or Lady Gaga's ARTPOP?
Aren't they both supposed to be satirical of pop music?
Yup, and they were both hated.
Lady Gaga for sure.
Why not U2?
Well, she didn't really change her character for it. U2 did an entire disaster of a tour.
U2 is better for me. Their music is much more sophisticated.
Lady Gaga was only crazy for two albums. She's "normal" now.
True, but U2 transcends all culture.
That's their problem. They're super snobby.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Beyonce?
She's incredible. I loved "Halo".
That's a great song. She has such a powerful voice.
I agree. Did you ever see the release she did called "Lemonade"?
That was the long video album, right?
Yes, I thought that was so creative.
I haven't watched it yet but I should.
It's really deep and personal lyrically.
That sounds great. I also like her upbeat stuff like "7/11".
That song is so much fun to dance along with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know Brandon Flowers from The Killers?
Yeah I do why?
He put out a pop album called The Desired Effect.
Whoa why have I not heard of this?
It's absolutely amazing, on par with his stuff in The Killers.
I've been needing more Brandon Flowers in my life so point me in its direction.
You can listen to it on Spotify.
Any standout tracks I should keep my eyes open for?
Between Me and You is a standout.
I will keep my ears open for that one thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Hanson?
Yes, the have been my favorite since MMMBop came out in 1996.
Have you ever seen them live?
Oh gosh yes! 7-8 times.
Can you believe they have 11 kids between them?
Are you serious?!?!?! I had no clue they had that many.
Do you know when their next tour is?
I don't but I would love to go see them if you wanted to get tickets.
Their new song is amazing, its so empowering.
I know it makes me want to go out and chase my dreams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I havent heard anything new from Justin Bieber.
Me either, i wonder why.
Do you think he is on tour or something?
He could be in the studio.
That would be cool. He could also just be taking a break.
Taking a break? Why?
Well, if you are on tour or in the studio, that's a lot of stress. Even tho he is young, you need rest.
That's true. I never though of it that way.
We shoud go look up what he is doing right now!
That's a good idea!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop musician?
That's a tough question. I would have to say Bebe Rexha.
She has not put out many songs at this point, has she?
Nope! She is very new. But she has some great songs already.
Like what? I'd love to check some out.
Listen to the track "I Got You"
Is that from her latest album?
I think she recently released it on an EP
Doesn't she have a song coming out with Lil Wayne too?
She does! It just came out. It is all about dancing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about pop music. Who is your favorite pop group?
I used to really like One Direction, but they haven't been the same since Zayn Malik left the group?
I know. I like the music that Zayn has done as a solo artist, but I can't remember anything from One Direction lately that has been good.
Same thing with Fifth Harmony. I think Camila Cabello leaving has destroyed the group.
It's weird for them to still be called Fifth Harmony with only four people in the group. Did you hear their latest song?
No, I haven't heard it. What is it called?
It's called Down and it has a feature by Gucci Mane. You should look it up. It is a great dance record.
I have been hearing Camila Cabello's song almost non-stop. I'm glad she proved she can be successful on her own.
I think it is hard for pop artists to get along in a group. All the good groups break up.
I think for girl groups it is especially hard because they all have diva attitudes, and everyone wants to be the star. It's sad because I really liked their music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to Taylor Swift lately and I actually like it.
I like some of hers but my favorite right now is Arianna Grande.
Yeah, after the bombing she got a lot of attention.  I hadn't really heard of her music until then.
So what did you think of it?
I liked it.  It's just not as intense as I prefer.
I guess it is more for a younger crowd.  Do you like Justin Timberlake?
oh yes!  I forgot about him!
He is really good!  What about that song Can't Stop the Feeling?
I love that!  I like to play it in the mornings when I need to get going but am feeling really down and sluggish.
It's the perfect song to get you up and feeling good for the day!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Noah cyrus?
Miley Cryrus's sister?
Yep. I really am enjoying her music.
I do think I like some songs, but prefer Miley overall.
Have you heard Noah's Stay Together?
Yes I like the carefree attitude in it.
I think the beat is so good.
It really reminds me of miley's , We can't stop.
I suppose both have a carefree party message. But noah's is softer.
Ya it is a bit more romantic in the chorus lyrics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite 60s band was Paul Revere and the Raiders.
Wasn't that the leader's real name?
Yes, Paul Revere Dick.
What were some of their hits?
Like, Long Hair was their first hit in 1961.
Didn't they do a Chuck Berry song?
Louie, Louie in 1963.
Cool. Didn't they have a name change?
They became The Raiders in the 70s.
By then I think they were out of fashion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen BEAUTY AND THE BEAT?
It's by Justin.
He was born in 1994.
His middle name is Drew.
He was born in Ontario.
Ontario is in Canada.
He plays the guitar.
And also plays the piano.
He plays my heart.
I love him too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop artist?
I would have to say Michael Jackson.
Wow! Old school! What is your favorite song of his?
That is so hard to pick. Probably the classic Man In The Mirror.
My favorite song of his is Heal the World. It always makes me emotional.
His stage performances give me chills!
He is definitely an icon. I don't think anyone can compare to him.
What other songs of his do you like?
I love Billie Jean!
That one is awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which artist which you say made better pop music? Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears?
I would probably say Christina. Her songs have more depth and emotion.
That is true but Britney has some catchy tunes.
I know. I have danced to many of them with you on the dance floor.
Speaking of dancing, Christina has had some dance music herself.
Has she? I have never heard of the songs.
Yes she has. I don't think they did very well on the pop music charts.
Well, both artists are still relevant.
That is true. Christina is on the Voice and Britney has residency in Las Vegas.
I bet it would be fun to see Britney in Vegas!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Lorde album is a masterpiece.
I haven't heard it yet, what's it called?
The new one is called Melodrama, it's produced by Jack Antonoff.
Whoa no way, Jack Antonoff produced it?
Yup, he seems to be everywhere nowadays.
True that, I am even more excited to hear it now.
You should be, the song Supercut is a grade A masterpiece.
Is it on Spotify?
Yeah it is but I have it physical.
Oh nice we can take a ride in your car and listen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite NSYNC song?
I love Bye, Bye, Bye.
Oh yeah, that music video is great too.
For sure. What's your favorite NSYNC song?
I like I Want You Back.
Oh that's a great song for karaoke.
Funny you should say that because it's what I usually sing.
Oh no kidding!
What's your usual karaoke song?
Genie In A Bottle by Christine Aguilera.
XXXXXXXXXXX
lana del rey is one of the best pop artists, i don't know why she's always shit on
she kind of has a whiny voice
yeah, but her lyrics are good
yeah, when they actually make sense.
they always make sense!
are we going to forget that she had a song about her kitty tasting like pepsi cola?
honestly, i'm ready to forget about that song for an eternity. what about born to die?
way too emo, i have no interest in such a boring song
diet mountain dew is good, though
....yeah, can't really deny that
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lorde's new album?
Melodrama? I like it.
Did you see it beat out 2 Chainz?
I did. I can't beleive it.
I don't like that 20 minute song
Yeah that was a weird move.
I like sober though
yeah that is a good track
I still don't my royals but i know some people hated it.
I always liked it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What pop band is your all time favorite?
You know pop is such a loose term. There are so many genres. I would consider REM to be part of that especially in the later years.
Yeah, I agree. Their sound changed a lot over the years.
I know in the beginning there was grit and tooth to it. As the more recent albums were released it seemed more pop to me.
Loosing My Religion is such a huge song for me personally.
I know what you mean. I was going through a lot at the time and that song was mine.
It's almost this kind of struggle and angst that I just don't feel in the music of today.
No it is definitely a different vibe.
Yeah, I think it actually was the precursor to grunge which I think some songs could be pop rock.
I agree. The labels get confusing and pigeon holing bands doesn't help. I think bands cross genres with their music otherwise it would be so boring for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do you fall on the Britney vs Christina debate?
I think Christina has the better voice, so her.
I agree, but Britney has the better songs.
Well I just think that Britney has a better production team.
All is fair in love and pop!
But Christina has the chops to do more outside of pop music.
Do you think she will?
I don't know, but I hope she does a jazz record. Or classical pop.
That would be a total surprise, I think.
Lady GaGa did it. Maybe Christina will too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite boy band?
I like One Direction!
But they broke up so they don't count!
Yes they do. One of my favorite songs was Story Of My Life.
I love that song.
I also love Little Things.
My favorite band is O2L.
They broke up too!
I like Trevor Moran's single!
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who's your favorite pop artist these days?
I'm not big on the artists now, but I do like Katy Perry.
Ewww... she's annoying.  I don't care for her.
I think she's a good singer.  Have you heard her hit the high notes in Firework?
I like Taylor Swift much better.  Are they still feuding?
I think so.  Although I think Katy is ready to squash that.
Yeah, probably because she wants to do some songs with her.
I doubt it.  Katy just released a new song called Swish Swish.
Well, I'm sure she'd want to collaborate with Taylor.
You keep on thinking that.  Taylor hasn't had a new song in a long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Britney Spears?
Not anymore.
I agree. Her live shows are pretty bad now.
She doesn't have much energy.
She used to be amazing!
Well of course her first album is iconic!
What song is your favorite?
I like Toxic. It always makes me want to dance.
I loved the music video for that one.
That song is really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the pop music that we would listen to growing up in the '90s?
Are you seriously asking if I remember '90s pop? How could I possibly forget the era of boy bands?
Who did you like more: Backstreet Boys or N*SYNC?
I have to say N*SYNC most definitely. Did you know they were my very first concert?
How cool! I would love to see them perform live!
What is your favorite song by them?
Its so hard to pick just one, but "Its Gonna Be Me" is up there in my top favorites, along with "This I Promise You".
"This I Promise You" is SUCH a beautiful song!
Remember when Justin Timberlake still had the bleach blonde frosted curly hair? It was "Tearin' Up My Heart" when he said "Bye, Bye, Bye" to the curls and shaved his head!
I was so sad when I saw that his curly hair was "Gone", I just kept thinking "I Want You Back".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big pop music fan?If you call The Beatles pop music,I'm a huge fan.
They are considered pop by many.
Yes they are.
How about today's pop artists.
I like The Chainsmokers.
Yea,they're pretty good.
They just played live near me.
Really? Did you go?
No,I couldn't make it.
That's to bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the Biebs?
Ah, the Biebs.  He's quite a character.
Yeah, but is he talented?
I would say that he is quite talented.  Some music is better than other stuff.
He has really been able to ride waves well.
Yes, somehow he gets ahead of the wave and profits well.
Some of his stuff is garbage.
I agree, but some of his younger material was more relevant to that time period.
Would you let your young daughter listen to him?
Now, that's a whole other conversation for another time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Maroon 5?
Absolutely.  They are one of my favorite bands.
Every album has such great songs.  'Songs about Jane' was one of my favorite albums.
I think one thing that I wish they didn't do was collaborate with so many hip-hop artists.
I like those collaborations.  'Don't Wanna Know' featuring Kendrick was so good.
That one I didn't mind, but 'Cold' featuring Future was weak in my opinion.
I have mixed feelings about that one.
I think overall, Maroon 5's sound is already good as is, and the majority of rappers they featured have not added value to the song.
Who do you think is the biggest culprit of this?
I severely disliked Wiz Khalifa's feature in 'Stereo Hearts' because not only was the rapping underwhelming, but the language and tempo just didn't fit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's been up with Taylor Swift? I haven't heard about her in a while.
She's been out of the spotlight this year. I think that she was doing ads for Diet Coke and the Sony digital camera.
I know a while back that she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross for the victims of that flood in Iowa.
She made the top 100 celebrity list in Forbes magazine last year.
I subscribe to Forbes too. They reported her as one of the top earning female musicians.
10 Grammy Awards and she's only 27.
Her pop cross over stuff did great. When I was in Texas, they played "Love Story" on the rock stations.
At the gym, they play "Shake it Off" all the time.
I think the album that song is on, 1989, sold 6 million copies.
The concert tour for 1989 was one of the highest money makers of this decade.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Adele?
Yes I especially like her song Hello.
That is also my favorite song of her's.
She has such a range with her voice.
Yes for sure. Not all singers have that.
What about Rihanna?
Yes she has many songs I like.
I love the Rehab the one she sings with Justine Timberlake.
Yes that one is pretty cool. My favorite is Umbrella.
Yes that one is great too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Jennifer Lopez still make music?
I think she does! I heard her on the radio recently.
She used to collaborate with a lot of different musicians.
That's true. She had a very popular song with Pitbull several years ago. It was called "On The Floor"
Now she is on the TV though.
She's an actress?
Yes! She has a big role on a police show.
What was the title?
The title is Shades of Blue
Cool! I love her music and I am sure I will like her TV show when I watch it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like Twenty One Pilots.
How many people are in that band?
There are two.
Two people in a band?
Yep.  One is the drummer.  The singer plays everything else.
Like what?
Piano, mostly.  But he also plays guitar and even a ukele.
Cool.  I thought they were kind of religious.
Not really.  They have thought provoking songs that make people think it's preachy.
I'm going to have to try them out. Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What pop artists are you into?
I like Pharrell a lot.
Oh awesome! I love Pharrell.
What song do you like?
I like Happy.
I like the song Come Get it Bae.
Oh will Miley Cyrus?
Yeah.
They both do well together.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any underrated pop bands?
New Kids on the Block
I agree
Are you a big fan of them?
Yes, I have all of their CD's
What is your favorite song of theirs?
Hangin' Tough
That has a great melody
I like their dance moves too
They are an all around great band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am still unsure of the origins
Of what
Pop music you know
Well it probably has changed throughout time
What do you mean
Well what has been popular has been changing through out time
I guess you are right on that fact
So that means it changes based on the generation
Ah i get it
Yeah so its not static and has no clear roots
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Adele's success at the Grammys this year?
Even though it was not brand new, that album she won for, 25 is pretty amazing.
I really like her voice on the song Hello.
Yes, that song showcases her talent very well.    What were the other singles?
I know Water Under the Bridge is the most recent release.
Definitely!    Love the lyrics of that song.
You don't think it is just another relationship tune?
Maybe, but I don't get people calling it cheesy.
For sure.    This is her third album, and the style is set.    Know anything about the next one?
Haven't heard anything.     Hope it isn't nearly five years like between 21 and 25.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What pop artist would love to spend the day with?
For me ed sheeran. I love his music.
i wonder if he would serenade you or take you to a  buffet?
Why a buffet?
It is in one of his lyrics, thrifty so he enjoys a buffet.
Oh ya, lol. He seems so real and downto earth.
Well he is a super talent but not the best looking.
Many girls would disagree with you. he looks like prince Harry to me.
I think the red hair is the reason.
Ya, I doubt Harry can sign like Ed. I would pick Ed sheeran everyday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Bruno Mars?
I think he is a great artist.
Do you think he is the new Michael Jackson?
He's had some good song, but not Michael Jackson level.
I would say Beyonce is closer to the new Michael Jackson.
I would agree with that.
She has had so many hit songs like Michael Jackson.
The think I love about Beyonce is you never hear anything bad about her.
Has Beyonce and Bruno Mars done a song together?
I don't know, but I would image they have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do  you think about pop music?
I generally steer away from it, as it appeals to a bland, undeveloped musical taste.
It's generally geared toward younger people and is designed to sell as much as possible.
Exactly: "designed to sell" is the perferct description.
Are there any pop artists that you think are good though?
There have been some good pop artists, like Carol King, and some rock artists, like David Bowie, that have put out pop songs.
That's true. What about more recent music?
It's hard for me to listen to the music of today, but every once in a while I hear something that isn't bad.
What would you consider decent examples of today's pop music?
I have heard some songs by Adele and Bruno Mars that are tolerable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who are some of your favorite pop artists?
Hmm, i've always like James Taylor, Iron and Wine, The Decembrists
What about the Lumineers?
Yeah, i love them
Me too.
Who else do you like?
I like Paul Simon and Leonard Cohen
Yeah, they're both legends
Yes...Neil Young too
Neil is definitely a legend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Justin Bieber?
Honestly, I made fun of him a lot when he first started out and was young.
Well, his voice was really high.
Yeah. I like his music a lot now actually. Especially post Selena.
I've always loved his music, even when he was young!
What's your favorite old song of his?
I liked One Less Lonely Girl. It was so cute!
What's your favorite recent song?
I love his song called I'm The Only One.
That one is really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favourite pop song?
I think I like just about any thing by Ed Sheeran.
What songs does he sing?
Thinking Out Loud is one of his more famous ones.
I like that song, I guess I like him too.
What is your favorite?
I like Lady Gaga stuff.
Like what?
My favorite song of hers is Poker Face.
I liked dancing to that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who's your favorite pop singer?
Mine is Madonna, who's yours?
Mine is Michael Jackson!!!
Oh man, he was the KING of POP! Can't deny that much.
He was a genius. Did you know he's the most awarded Artist of all time? He won more awards than any other musician alive or deceased.
Yeah I remember that day he left with his arms full of them. He also had the most expensive music videos in history.
Yeah his videos were the first multi-million dollar video clips and the most expensive ones in history too.
I head he also has the Guinnes record for Highest-Earning Deceased Artist. Quite sad but impressive.
Yeah he was the best, Thriller is going to be forever the best Halloween song. Heartbreaking...
I know but he left us an unforgettable catalog that can last us 100 lifetimes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was N Sync the best boy band in the 90s?
Depends on what your standards were.
As far as album sales.
I think they were close with Backstreet Boys
I would say they had better careers
Most of them are still working in the media
Justin Timberlake launched a huge career
Yeah and none of the Backstreet Boys are doing anything
Joey Fatone has a huge career do
Yeah I would say N Sync is number one
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the most recent Pop CD that you purchased?
I bought Imagine Dragon's new CD, but I don't think you could consider that "POP".
I think you would consider that pop music.
If that's the case, I purchased Imagine Dragon's CD last.
That's cool.  What's your favorite song?
I really like "Thunder".
That's a great song, I listed to it pre-release on Youtube.
Same here.  As soon as I heard it I pre-ordered it with Amazon.
Do you buy a lot of pop music CDs from Amazon?
I usually listen to my music on Amazon music with their free streaming service with Prime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been thinking about Elvis Presley recently.  do you think he was over-rated, or do you think he deserved all the attention he got?
Well, when you consider that he was a singer who was certainly unique, and that he also appeared in movies, i would say he deserved everything he got.  he was one of a kind; a once in a lifetime superstar.
I know what you mean.  it's hard to believe it's been 40 years since he died.  I"ll never forget that day.
I'm a little too young to remember his death, but i do know it made millions of people very sad.  He had fans all over the world.
The thing about Elvis is that when it looked like his career might have been over, in the late 1960s, he made a great come back.
That's for sure.  One of my brothers still has the Elvis album that he recorded live in Hawaii; i think that was a big part of the come-back.
And his mega-hit  "In the Ghetto" made a lot of the younger folks, who hadn't been big Elvis fans, take notice.
Wow i had totally forgot that song.  When i think of his comeback, i think more of the super song "Suspicious Minds."
Oh, what a great song, i still find myself humming that song once in a while.  Always nice to talk about Elvis; a true legend.
Legend is a word used too loosely, but in Presley's case it's true...he was and still is a legend.  his music lives on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop artist?
I am really enjoying the tracks drake is putting out.
Energy by drake is a great track.
That is a very catchy track and one of my favorites next to hotline bling.
He is really good in feature tracks as well, as he has a good depth of song types.
yeah, the phases of drake. I like Forever featuring Drake, Kanye West, Lil Wayne, and Eminem.
That is a great song as you would guess considering the artists on the track.
I think Eminem and lil' wayne had the best verses but Drake pulled the whole thing together.
I think they all had good verses including Kayne West.
I hope we get to hear more collaboration tracks with big name artists working together like Forever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Britney Spears might be the world's oldest teen.
Uhm, I see what you mean, but I saw her perform, and she put on the ideal act for Las Vegas.
You mean she was vulgar and over the top, unbelievable and trashy. Like Vegas.
No, I mean she slayed. Her act mixes naive and sophisticated like a gambler who's been losing in that town for 20 years.
Oh. Naive and knowing. She knows all the ways to lose.
Yeah. But not how to stop playing.
But really she's a hard-working highly-trained Southern girl who as brought up in show business. She's a professional.
Right. It's an act. I'm sure she's somone else when she's not working.
I'll tell you though, when she's working, she's the queen of pop. You should go see her. Just climb over all those screaming fans.
Right, and dirty old men like you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some of your favorite pop artists?
Since i was born in the 70's, i'd have to say Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Adam Ant and so many others
What about today?
I don't really have favorites but i do like Fiona Apple, and Alanis Morrisette
What pop songs do you listen to?
Single Ladies by Beyonce and Shake it off by Taylor Swift
What does Pop music mean to you?
Well at one time it was only white artists that were pop, but today pop music is just popular music.
Do you think pop music will be forever?
Absolutely, as long as the music stays popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so surprised Madonna is still putting out albums?
Really, she's the Queen of Pop though, what else is she supposed to do.
Retire.
She's not gonan retire, she just put out an album in 2015.
Yeah, Rebel heart was a pretty good album, best one she's put out in a while.
Well nothign can beat what she was doing in the 80s, Like a Virgin is still amazing.
And thats exactly my point, her best stuff is the music she did was like 25 years ago.
No way, has been pushing the pop industry well through the 90s and 2000s
Ray of Light and American Life are ok I guess.
They're more then ok, they're awesome.  She's the queen of pop, hands down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Fifth Harmony?
Are you kidding me, of course I have, they're like one of the most popular pop singers
indeed, man you gotta check out their music video
which one? they have a lot of music videos.
Can't remember the full name, something to do with work
you mean "work from home?"
exactly, that's the one
oh I've seen the video as well, they're very juicy and the beats are good
Is that your favorite music from them?
probably
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ed Sheeran is such a great singer.
Yeah he is really good and has a great voice.
You know he is not an American right?
Yes I am well aware.
Thinking Out Loud was such a great song
I wouldnt say was, it still is
Yeah I think it was produced wonderfully
He did win awards for it I believe
Yes I think he won a Grammy for it
As he should, it was a great track
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into pop music at all?
Oh I love pop music.
Who is your favorite?
I love Britney Spears.
Oh me too! What song do you like the best?
I love circus.
Me too even though it is so old.
Have you seen her in concert?
Not yet but I hope to.
We should see her together
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, who did Uptown Funk better, Bruno Mars or Rick Astley?
Wait, Rick Astley did Uptown Funk?! I must find that on YouTube. Now wait.
Okay, did you find it?
Wow, Okay, I have to go with Rick Astely.
No way! Nothing is better than Bruno Mars.
Oh no, everything Rick Astley does is awesome.
Really? Okay, well I'll stay in this century with Bruno Mars.
Oh, Bruno Mars is great. But come on, it's Rick Rollin' Astley.
Agree to disagree.
Okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is pop music, anyway?
what do you mean?
well, it's a bunch of different genres and it's one genre. what exactly makes a pop song?
it has to be on the top 40 charts, i think.
okay...so literally just pOPular music?
yeah, i guess it's not really a genre at all. any genre can be pop...
as long as it's popular
so what's your favorite pop song, then?
bohemian rhapsody
i guess that counts!

Ariana Grande resumed her tour after briefly suspending it following the Manchester attacks, but it had to be scary going to her first gig back.
I'm sure anyone would be nervous, but I think they picked her show because of opportunity, not because of her.
Her next show back though was Paris- and Paris has had a LOT of terrorism incidents, including a concert where a lot more people died than the Manchester concert.
Yeah, I'm not sure I'd want to be a pop singer on tour right now, there's been so many incidents.
The authorities all say don't let them take away your freedom, and continue your normal lives, but that's hard to do if you think you might be in danger.
Well, Ariana Grande did have the big Manchester benefit concert and security was tight, but everything went fine.
They said security would be heavy for the Paris show too of course, becuase of the potential for an incident.
The fans are really brave to keep going out to things instead of laying low at home.
I'm sure overseas fans feel like they don't know when they would get a chance to see her again, so that's why they risk it.
They must be really devoted Ariana Grande fans to take the risk though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your opinion on 'Believer?'
Is that the Monkees song that was remixed by Smash Mouth?  I love both versions.
No. I am referring to the song by Imagine Dragons.
I see.  I don't know that one.
I highly recommend it.  It's quite catchy.
I think I will.  I really liked Imagine Dragon's 'Demons' and 'Radioactive.'
'Demons' is one of my favorites.
That's one of two songs I know by them, but I just love the slow tempo of it and rhythm.
The rest of the album, 'Night Visions' is just as good.
They definitely have a very unique sound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite hip-hop singer?
I really like Kanye West and most of his music.
I like Kanye, my favorite track is Power.
That is one of my favorites as well, but I think his track I wonder is underrated.
I had not heard that track but that is a good track, up there with through the wire.
Even if he is crazy he makes some excellent music.
More recently he has been growing his labels under Def Jam records.
I heard about that, as he signed Desiigner after sampling his track on his seventh album The Life of Pablo.
I see that he has gotten more into producing music now, much in the way that Dr. Dre moved into producing and brought in Eminem.
That does make sense, putting that crazy talent to work recognizing other crazy talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Pop Music?
Not today's pop .
I like Michael Jackson  and the Jackson Five kind of pop.
Today's pop  music seems brainless to me. No one stands out anymore.
I agree. I refuse to even listen to current radio.
Me either. I don't even know very many popular stars or their music if I hear it
Well you aren't missing anything.
How do these people get popular? They vocals are so doctored that a lot of them really stink under normal circumstances.
It's called brainwashing.
And lipsynching helps! Wake up people!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, is there anyone in Pop music right now that you are really into?
Oh yeah, there are actually quite a few different artists. But I really like a lot of Drake's new songs.
Oh, cool! I like his new stuff too. Anything that really stands out for you?
Well, I really like "Signs." I just think it is a great song.
I like that song too. Anything else by Drake that you really like?
Oh, yeah, for sure. I really liked his record "What a Time to be Alive."
I know that album pretty well; it was really good! It had "Jumpman" on it, which was a great song.
Yeah, that's right! It was a super popular song a few years ago, and I still think it is one of Drake's best.
Oh, totally. I actually can't wait for some new songs.
Me too! He has a tough job of following his own act, but I can't wait to hear what he has next!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose pop music song are you listening to?
Katy Perry's Firework.
I love her! I also like Taylor swift now that she is pop.
I do too and I like that her music isn't just confied to pop.
Me too! Did you also hear the new song by Bruno mars?
No what is it called?
24 carat magic, it has a great beat.
That is actually one of his recent songs but the new release is Versace on the Floor.
Oh I haven't heard that! When did it come out?
June 12,2017 is the release date but I had his album so I was already listening to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard SORRY?
I think Justin Bieber wrote that.
It was released in 2015.
It has 2.6 billion views.
The girls are dress colorfully.
The girls seem to do all the dancing.
Is he even in the video?
I don't understand why it has so many views.
Maybe all the colors keeps peoples attention.
It is an OK song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider Elton John pop?
Absolutely, he was great too.
I loved Crocodile Rock.
Candle in the Wind is my favorite song by him of all time.
I think that was great as well.
He was such a terrific performer its a shame hes not making new music.
Well everyone gets old at some point!
His music though spans so many generations.
Yes my children love it too.
Rocketman is a song that has stood the test of time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like pop music. do you listen to Rihanna?
OMG yes! Have you seen the video for "Bitch better have my money"
Hilarious! and the elevater sceen where the rich woman ends up in the trunk!
I know I laughed like a fool.
I liked that little dog too!
Yeah he was really cute
I thought it was kinda funny at the end when she was sitting in the trunk with all that money!
I wouldn't mind have all that money.
Me either, but I can't sing! LOL
Well Rihanna sure can. Man I love her music!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you any new Ed Sheeran songs?
Only one or two, I want to hear more.
There is this one song I like a lot.
What is the name?
Galway girl has great lyrics and sounds great.
Wow I dont think I've heard that one yet.
I havent heard it on the radio yet but I listen to it online and really like it.
Wow I want to hear it.
Yes it is a really great song.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are the key features of pop music?
The most important factor is theft.
What? What do you mean?
To me, the key to pop music is stealing all the cool things from the underground scene.
Give me an example.
Well, there's a lot more distortion in today's music. Consider, for example, the grunge genre.
Yes, so what?
Well, distortion is a key element of industrial music. And, that's been around for 100 years.
I see. Can you give me another example.
Sure. Processed vocals have been popular for a long time in the underground. And, they've started showing up in pop music recently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Jessica Simpson?
Yes she had a one hit wonder kind of career.
Well she married a pop artist as well.
They never collaborated did they?
Not big enough to produce a decent song.
What was the song she had that was big.
It sampled John Cougar's song "Jack and Diane"
I think it was called Crazy for You
I dont remember but it was a huge hit
It got released in the summer so it was perfect placement.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any music by Bruno Mars?
I really like the song "Just the Way You Are" by him!
Yes I really love that one too.
Another good one is "That's what I like."
I know that one! I hear it on the radio a lot.
Me too. I love when it comes on!
I do also! I crank the volume when I hear it.
He has a great voice.
He really does. So smooth.
Definitely a favorite artist of mine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like pop music?

Right.  I feel sometimes like I could listen to her music all day long.
what is your favorite song of hers?
Gosh, there are so many! I really like "Hello".
Yes, but that gets played over and over, so much!
True.  What do you like for songs of hers?
I really like Rolling in the Deep.  She has a good beat with her music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the current Queen of Pop?
Hmm, that's a good question....
It definetely used to be Brittney Spears.

I think the new Queen of Pop is Beyonce, though.
Oh yeah, her music is on another level with anyone else.
What's your favorite song of hers?
That's hard, but I really like Formation right now.
Yeah, it's so good!
But I like all her music, honestly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of CALL ME MAYBE by Carly Rea?
Yes, she was born in Canada.
I think she was born in 1985.
She also acts.
I like CALL ME MAYBE.
That must be her most famous song.
I like the boy in the song.
He is full of muscles.
Her friends get her to wash the car.
But she is looking at him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to Mariah Carey?
She is alright.
Like her career tailspinned quickly.
I dont think that happen she had a huge Christmas hit recently
All I want for Christmas is you is very old.
Well she settled down and no longer needed to perform
But then she had the incident on New Years Eve.
Yeah that was bad.
I dont know I guess she lost it one she stopped making music.
I think it shows how fake she was the entire time
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite pop song on the radio right now?
Probably "Stay" by Alessia Cara and Zedd.
I love that one!
I love how she sings it. She's the perfect voice for it.
Others could make it work.
Yeah, but her specific delivery is unique.
Sure. You didn't ask me mine.
What's your favorite?
Lady Gaga's The Cure.
Horrible lyrics, sorry. I'll cure you with my love? How lame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Madonna is called the Queen of Pop?
Well, she deserves it.
I liked her, right from when she started.
Me too.
Like A Prayer was one of my favorites.
Me too.
I also loved Papa don't Preach.
I forgot about that one. Thats great.
She puts on a great show too.
I'd like to see her in concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of taylor swift
i liked her better when she was country
she never was that country though
she was kinda country pop
her new album did away with that completely
its strictly pop
its catchier though
her old stuff had more soul
that may be true
i think so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about music, who is your favorite pop star?
Recently, I have been listening to a lot of lady gaga's work.
Oh, I am a big fan of Bad Romance, which is your favorite?
My favorite is just dance but I also really like Bad Romance.
Did you know that Lady Gaga took her name from the Queen song "Radio Gaga"?
No, I did not know that. I wonder if her music is also inspired by Queen.
Well she is also famous for doing covers and has done one of the Queen classic "another one bites the dust".
I think she has definently been influenced by them in the best way.
She has had a great many influences I think, based on the numerous artists she has done covers of. All of which has spilled over into her pop career.
I believe you are right, and it has certainly benefited her music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a wedding to DJ this weekend, the request is pop music
Oh how fun, I love Pop
who is your favorite pop artist
Justin Timberlake hands down, he is amazing
I agree, he not only sings so well, but he can dance like I never see
Oh he sure can, whats your favorite song from him?
Oh thats easy, I love "rock your body"
I love that too, I used to love when he was in  NSYNC
I still listen to  NSYNC, I love them!
If you love pop, then you have to love a boy band
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading an article about the band 5th Harmony yesterday about why they're not changing their name.
Why would they want to change it anyways?
Well, one of the members left for a solo career, so there's only four in the band now.
And they didn't want to change it to Four Harmonies?
No, they said it's their brand. The fans helped pick the name, and it's what they're used to.
Maybe they will get a new member?
It didn't say they were looking for someone. They just figured out a corny angle to it.
What was corny?
They said since the fans named them, the fans would be the fifth member.
Well, at least they appreciate their fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Bruno Mars song?
I really like Uptown Funk.
Oh I agree. I don't think there's anyway to listen to that song and not become happy.
Yeah, it's so infectious.
What do you think about his new hit?
That's What I Like? I'm not loving it.
Me either. The beat is not as catchy.
Oh I dislike the lyrics.
I can see that. Almost makes me start to think of Blurred Lines.
Yeah, they're not quite at that level, but the lack of the actual woman's voice in the song really takes away women's agency  inadvertently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read something stupid Lourde said recently about Taylor Swift.
It better not have been mean, you know how ferocious Taylor's fans are.
She said being friends with Taylor was like having a friend with an auto-immune disorder or severe allergies, because you can't go to certain places or do certain things.
She should be grateful to have a friend like Taylor Swift regardless of what they get to do together.
Apparently people got mad because they saw it as insensitive to people with disorders, and especially Selena Gomez who was diagnosed with Lupus.
I've always felt sorry for Selena, she seems like such a nice girl, and then she had a hard time with Justin Bieber, and then being diagnosed with Lupus.
Sometimes famous people like pop singers don't stop and realize they have to be careful what they say, because they have fans following them, and their words can be really hurtful to fans.
What did Taylor say about it?
There wasn't any comment from her, but Lourde went on twitter and apologized for being insensitive.
It is insensitive to use a medical problem like that as a joke. It's not a joke to people who have it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you think of any Pop Artists who have crossed over to Rnb?
Old School Pop or New School Pop?
It doesn't matter, I just want to see if you are on your Ps and Qs on Pop music.
Bette Milder would be an old school crossover.
I thought you would say Michael McDonald because of his Motown Hits album.
Justin Beiber have made some head way in Rnb.
Didn't he win Best Rnb artist recently?
I think you are thinking of Justin Timberlake.
If we go way way back Old School Dusty Springfield would be considered a crossover Rnb artist.
Wow! You went way back to the 60s on that one. High Five!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite female pop artist right now?
Hmm. I guess I would have to say Beyonce.
She's good. I like Rhianna better.
Her voice is cool. But Lemonade is great.
I like that Beyonce is trying to get everyone in formation.
For sure. Jay Z who?
I hate Miley Cyrus though.
Oh yeah, she's the worst.
I can't handle white artists right now.
Yeah. They all seem pretty tone deaf and clueless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the pop band OK GO?
Yeah! I saw some of their music videos.
Their videos are so creative!
My favorite one is for the song "Upside Down & Inside Out." It is so cool!
That one is great. I also love "The One Moment" video
The colors they use in that video are really beautiful.
I agree! And the way that they shot it is very interesting too.
Did they do it all in one take?
I believe that they did!
Wow! They must have been working with some very talented producers and directors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any good pop music lately?
Yeah I really like Ariana Grande.
Oh same, she is unbelievably talented.
I totally agree. I love her cover of over the rainbow.
Oh I did not know she did that!
Yeah definitely check it out.
I love her song problem.
That is good and catchy.
Have you seen her live?
Nope but I hope to soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you stoked about the new Lorde concert?
What? I didn't know she is going on tour!
Yeah, after 2 years of hiatus, she came out with a new album!
Really? What does it call?
Melodrama, and the music are really good.
Well, I wouldn't doubt that, she has always made good music.
Yeah, and this album she's a lot happier, like the songs are not as sad.
That's good to hear, I do like her older stuffs too, though.
What is your favorite song from her?
I love Royals and Team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really loved Kesha's cover of  Zedd's True Colors.
I think it is the saddest thing ever. Makes me cry every time.
I think it's powerful. Especially the last chorus, it really feels like finally defeating your demons and surviving.
I never thought of it that way, but that's a really good point.
I hope her new album will contain less autotune and party songs and more emotional powerful ballads.
That would be great. Her voice really is amazing,
She did a live performance of Gaga's Till It Happens To You, that will blow you away.
I bet. That song is already emotionally charged, with Kesha's voice added to it, it must be incredible.
It is. Its one of my all time favorite cover songs.
I'll definitely make sure I check it out. Thank you for telling me about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the latest Bruno Mars song?
I liked his original hit album a lot.
His new hit song is as great as any of his other songs.
What is the name?
Thats what I like is the name.
Ok thank you for mentioning.
My pleasure, the song has emotional lyrics and fun yet powerful acoustics or instrumentals as well.
Wow that sounds great.
Yes he is a talented artist.
Yes he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any good pop music recently?
I have really got into Miley Cyrus as of late.
Do you like her style?
I did not like her older, sort of mix between pop and country songs, but the new stuff I do.
I liked her song, "Wrecking Ball".
That was a good one, very pop and bubble gum type of feel you know?
I think she does ok with the pop style. Like her album Dead Petz.
I think that one was good. Lot of upbeat stuff.
I like that she draws from others a lot
She does do similar stuff to other pop artists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw a movie on an old pop music star who was living off fame he gathered in his youth.
Oh, yeah! The movie with Drew Barrymore...
And Hugh Grant!
That's right!
But doesn't that always happen? Some group, like the Boyz II Men, gets famous on teeny bopper music, and then make a career out of being former teen idols?
Yeah. I was a former teen idol.
You were? No way!
Well maybe not me personally, but I had a few teen girls fall in love with me because my first name is Barry...
I don't get it. In the movies, the guy named "Barry" is always the weirdo...
Yeah, but when I was young, there was this Pop music star named Barry Manilow, who the girls couldn't resist. I even had one girl aks to marrty me so that she could say she was "Mrs. Barry..."
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to Christina Aguilera today!
What a blast from the past!
I know. I'm listening to Dirty right now.
I never liked that one. I like her more emotional songs.
Which ones?
Well my favorite is You Are Beautiful.
That song is so beautiful!
The lyrics really resonate with me.
Her voice is one of the best voices in pop music.
I wish she would come out with a new song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the king of pop?
You mean Michael Jackson?
Yes I do.
Not as an individual,but what a talent.
I know what you mean.
Thriller is one of the best albums of all time.
Billie Jean,Beat It,Thriller.
It goes on and on.
The MTV video for thriller was awesome.
It's still a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard I'M THE ONE?
Its by Justin Bieber.
DK Kahled is in it.
He rides the horse.
WE THE BEST MUSIC presents.
It was released in 2017.
It already had 400 thousand views.
It has a simple beat.
Just didn't seem to have as many tattoos.
He looks good shirtless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about pop music?
I don't know, that's such a wide term.     Start with one artist.
OK.      Maybe Justin Timberlake.
I really like him when he shows up on Jimmy Fallon and SNL.
Yes, he is always very funny.    His dancing is amazing too.
I really like that one song off the Trolls soundtrack, do you remember the name.
Yes, that song is called Can't Stop the Feeling!
Didn't it win an award too?
Yes, it won a Grammy award, and I think was nominated for an Oscar.
Wow!    He really is quite talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you like Katy Perry?
I like that she was born Mormon.
Well thats just details.
I know but its important in my view.
I think California Girls is such a great track.
I enjoy it very much as well.
Would you consider her the top pop start of this decade?
It does seem all she makes is hits
She can do anything and make it seem amazing!
She is talented more than we probably give her credit for.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do think of when I say pop music?
I would say it is music that is popular.
So what about a band like Metallica.
I don't think they are pop music.
Metallica is a popular band.
I guess then I would say pop music is something else.
Do you think it's music that made for teens?
I would say pop music is more geared for teens but appeals to everybody.
Pop music is hard to define isn't it?
Yeah but I still think it's any music that is popular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the old pop music
Like Britney Spears?
Yes and Destiny's Child
They were very good.
Do you like Bieber?
Not at all
I find his music annoying
Me too
The older stuff has better melodies
I agree 100 percent
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
Yeah I have a bunch of those Now CDs with pop artists.
Who is your favorite?
I like Britney Spears before she got all trashy.
Yeah I  like Oops I Did It Again.
She had some good hits.
Is Adele considered a pop artist?
I don't know- she is more soulful.
I really admire Adele's voice.
I secretly like Taylor Swift but she is so successful that I hate her too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My brother loved The Association.
What were theirbiggest hits?
"Cherish", "Windy", and "Never My Love" were platinum.
What was their first album?
And Then...Along Comes the Association.
Cool.  Didn't they have a controversial song?
Along Comes Mary, referring to Mary Jane.
Cool.  When did they break up?
1978.  But they tried a comeback in 1979.
I
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Taylor Swift is any good?
You know,I think maybe as a country artist more than pop.
Really? That's interesting.
Yea,she became interested in country when she was around nine I think.
I think somewhere in that area.
Then she went pop and became a huge hit.
Her album Fearless debuted at number one in 2008
Yes,huge for her.
Best selling album of 2009 in the USA.
Wow,I,didn't realize that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hear melodies in my head, melodies in my head!
Ha, you must love that song!
I'm a big Madison Beer fan over here!
Madison Beer is a good singer.
I believe she is talking about Justin Bieber in that song, right?
Are you sure she's not talking about her boyfriend?
Well, in the music video, Madison is wearing JB Beats by Dre, and JB is in the entire video, and at the end, Madison meets him.
Oh, I see. Then she probably is talking about Justin in the song.
Yeah, and it's super adorable!
Sure sounds adorable, I may have to go check it out on YouTube!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You listen to Train?
I do sometimes.  Their music is pretty good.
Have you heard their new album?
I've heard some of the songs.
Do you like the new single?
Yeah, the deejay one?  I love it.
Are the other songs on the CD good?
There are like three of them that have a throwback soulful feel.  I liked those the best.
They are usually so creative.
Yeah, they are fun to listen to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Usher helped jump start Justin Beibers music career?
No, but I still love Usher's hit "Yeah."
True or False. The girl group named "The Ronettes" are sisters?
I think that's false. Did you know Sister Sledge of "We Are Family" fame had a lot of in group fighting.
I heard one the Sledge sisters recently died. I hope it wasn't the one who sang lead on "He's The Greatest Dancer."
It was Jonie that pass and it was "Kathy Sledge" that sang lead for the group.
Wow! Did you know Niles Rogers of "Le Freak" and "Chic" fame produced several Sister Sledge songs.
Yes I did know that. Nile Rogers also produced David Bowie on "Let's Dance."
I think Pharell recently did some Pop work with Nile Rogers.
Pharell got in some copyright trouble with that Thicke guy for their pop version of "Blurred Lines."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Jonah and the Lion?
Is it some sort of book?
No.  They're a band.
No.  What do they sing?
They're just coming up.  They sing just about everything.
How can they sing everything?  What genre is it?
I'd say pop, but there's a fun element to the band.
Are they like those parody song bands?  Like Weird Al or something?
No.  They sing real songs.  They just have a lot of fun.
Well, I'll just have to check them out.  This will be interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite pop song of all time is Hit Me Baby by Britney Spears.
That's an odd but respectable classic pick.
When you hear it you can't help but sing along.
This much is true, Britney was good at that.
We're even seeing her song Toxic kind of make a comeback.
Yeah which is odd out of nowhere.
Out of nowhere indeed, my kid sister has been blasting it.
Has it been getting radio airplay again?
Not that I know of, just seems to be an internet thing.
Leave it to the internet for dig up old tunes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite decade for pop music?
Wow, that's a tough question.
Do you think it's modern pop music?
No it doesn't have the same feel as something from the 80s or 90s.
I would say mine is 80s pop music.
That's a good choice. There were a lot of good songs.
What about you?
I would say 90s because they seemed to figure out how to make the perfect pop song then.
They really did have a lot of hit songs in the 90s.
It seemed like they figured out the formula of how to make a great pop song in the 90s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pop music is one of the best genres to listen to, who is your favorite male artist?
I like Shawn Mendez, he is really talented.
Have you heard his latest song?
Yes and its awesome. He really sounds fantastic.
Do you know who wrote that particular song?
I think Shawn Mendez wrote that song with Scott Harris.
What was the name of the song?
I believe it was "Nothing Holding me Back".
What are other songs that you like by Shawn Mendez?
I like "Stitches" and "Treat you Better". These were really good songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Taylor Swift?
I think she's great, I loved her music very much
for example?
like Love Story, and You Belong With Me
you know, I almost felt like falling in love with someone I don't know when I listen to Love Story
really? That song really has magic then.
yeah, especially the music video, she's so pretty and she met her prince and eventually got married, what a happy ending.
yea, but recently she moved to a totally different styled of music, it's more pop oriented, what do you think?
I think it's alright, she progress as a human being, so she progress in her music as well, things change
yeah, indeed
XXXXXXXXXXX
What ever happened to U2?
What do you mean?
They don't seem to be around as much.
But they're still around.
I guess they'll never break up.
They just had a world tour, I think.
Once upon a time, you couldn't walk ten feet without seeing Bono's face on something.
Yes, they aren't as ubiquitous as they used to be.
I guess I appriciate how they're around, but not in your face.
Yes, I'm sure they appreciate it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Ariana Grande?
I think she has one of the best voices to come out in a long time.
She's so beautiful too.
She really is. Have you ever heard "Side to Side" by her?
That's the one with Nicki Minaj, right?
Yeah. I'm always singing that song.
That song has such a cool swing to it.
It's one of my favorites on her album "Dangerous Woman".
Did she have an album besides that? That's the only one I know.
She actually has something like 7 albums currently. That one is the most popular, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Bruno Mars ever do the halftime show for the Superbowl?
Yeah, he did a few years back.
I don't remember that.
How could you forget?  It was pretty good.
Did anyone else perform with him?
I'm pretty sure.  I just don't remember.
Wait, was that the year Katy Perry was on?
Hmm.  It might have been.
What songs did he sing?
I honestly don't remember.  The singing and dancing though, were all everyone were talking about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Britney Spears is ending her tour in Las Vegas?
Yes! I was so upset I wanted to go. Does she sing her latest album?
It's a mix up of her older hits such as Baby one more time to her newest hits.
Sounds like so much fun! Her music is so great. My favorite song is Circus!
Great song! She is a great dancer and I hear she puts on quite a performance.
Nice to hear she turned her life around after her meltdown!
It really is.. she is back and doing better than ever.
I'm hoping I can make it out to Las Vegas to see her.
Me too! She is one of the greatest pop stars out there.
Yes, the princess of pop with over 9 great albums.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite artist in pop music?
It's difficult to say, but I had a crush for Avril Lavigne long time ago when I was in middle school
no way, I loved her music as well
yea, her street style appearance and good beats just got my heart when I was in my teenager years
you know what she's doing recently?
I'm not really sure, she's a married woman now, I think she's dedicating her life to being a good wife
well, it's both beautifuil and kinda sad, I miss her already
well, she's still publishing music, just not as fast rate
like what?
you know her song was featured as the main theme from Alice in Wonderland?
XXXXXXXXXXX
If Aretha Franklin is the queen of soul, who is the queen of pop?
That is a no brainer, it has to be Madonna.
Oh, I never thought about her. She had a lot of songs in the 1980's.
Not only the 1980's but she ruled in the 1990's.
What is your favorite Madonna song?
I have a lot of favorites. I love Express Yourself, Vogue, and Like a Virgin.
Sounds like you are a huge fan. Does she still make new songs?
She came out with some new ones in 2014 like Devil Pray and Living for Love.
I love it when a musician really devotes their life to their music.
I don't think that girl will ever retire.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of auto-tune?
Here we go.  Heck yes I am.
Oh my.  Why would you like such an overused thing?
Think about it.  It's a tool that perfects human singing, one of the most impactful sounds a human can hear.
Well, I like it when it first started.
Don't get auto-tune and vocoders confused.  Both are used all of the time in pop music.
Oh I love vocoders.  The harmonies are quite sweet.
Yeah, pop stars Roger and Zapp crushed the vocoder scene in the eighties.
Now everyone from Madonna to Daft Punk have used vocoder technology.
And auto-tune sounds like vocoders, so that's why I love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Ed Sheeran?
Of course! It's legally required to think of him as perfect.
That's kind of sadly true, actually.
Yeah, people go crazy for him.
I'm not the biggest fan.
Why not?
Well, I recognize his talent for sure, he's a good singer.
But..?
But his melodies don't work. They jump around too much.
Seriously! Ever hear people try to sing along to Shape of You? It's like a wrong-note-festival!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose music do you like better, Katy Perry or Taylor Swift?
Personally I'd have to say Katy Perry. Although I do like quite a few of Taylor Swift's songs.
Yea I feel like I'm too old to be super into Taylor Swift. Her music is more for like young teens.
Yea, it's harder to relate to her songs when you're not like 22 years old.
Katy Perry I feel like is more relatable though, even though a lot of her songs aren't like super meaningful or deep.
Yea, but they're just like really fun pop songs, they don't necessarily have to be super inspiring or deep.
True, I guess it's more important for them to be catchy and easy for people to sing along to.
Exactly. Like her songs California Gurls and Teenage Dream.
Yea, even my boyfriend knows the lyrics to those songs.
Haha! Well just goes to show how catchy they are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is some pop music that you like?
I really like Taylor Swift.
What song by her do you like?
I like the song trouble.
That is awesome.
I saw her in concert once.
Oh really? What tour?
Fearless.
Oh my goodness I am so jealous!
Yeah I recommend you go see her live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to any pop music currently
Yeah, I've been really into Drake, his new album is really good.
I love the song Passion  Fruit
Yeah, that's my favorite song too!
I love it when he collaborates with other artists
Yeah his song with Future was really fun
oh, are you talking about Jumpman? I like that song
Actually, I was talking about Grammys
When did that come out?
It was on the Views album
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about pop music these days?
For the most part, I think there are some pretty entertaining songs out there.
I agree.  What artists do you like?
I hate to admit it, but I do like some of Justin Beiber's stuff.
Yes.  I wouldn't run around admitting that, especially to your kids.
I also like some of the other stuff.  I think Lady Gaga is super talented.
There are so many people that aren't that talented, but they have the right people behind them.
The also have the benefit of studios that make their voices sound in tune.
There is so much variety right now.  I think you can usually find something you will like.
I agree, and there continues to be more and more songs coming out all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you noticed the change in Katy Perry lately.
She and her songs have gotten a bit dark as of late.
A long was from the cheeky pop she used to sing.
Yes, I loved her song Teenage Dream.
That was a real summer song.
I enjoy her shows too, she puts on a good act.
Her music videos used to be so bright.
I loved her I kissed a Girl song.
That was kind of ground breaking for her.
I think it was the song that really put her on the map.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I didn't really like Katy Perry until I saw The Interview.
What changed your mind?
Well, most of the movie is set up to be ridiculous.
It is Seth Rogan and James Franco.
Right. So there's a scene midway through where they talk about Firework.
Who is 'they'?
James Franco's character and Kim Jong-il.
Ah. That's a weird pairing.
And then it's played in the background at the end of the movie.
Pop music can be perfect like that sometimes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how do you like bruno mars
he's better than frank ocean
you like the new song?
its not download worthy though.
whats the name of it?
that strawberry champagne song
thats how i like it, you mean?
yeah, thats the song.
is it better than treasure
i never heard of it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best pop artist out right now?
Tough to say between Bruno Mars and Beyonce.
How about Nicki Minaj?
I would say shes more of a rapper.
Or Katy Perry?
No she is not that big
Thats crazy she had her own Super Bowl performance
I think thats terrible.
That she performed?
No that you wouldnt listen to her as one of the top pop performers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite album from Avril Lavigne?
Umm, it's a difficult question, I like a lot of her music. I like both The Best Damn Thing and Let Go
why is that?
because I feel her music has soul in it, and from song to song in an album, the overall feelings are the same, so I could listen to them all day long
what are some of your favorite songs from those 2 albums then?
to be honest, I like most of the music she published, but maybe Innocence and Complicated would stand out just a bit of more
They were such a sensation back in high school, right?
you bet, I feel the psychology in some of her music beats at the same rate as high school teenagers
her later music has become more mature, I think she has moved on
indeed, so did we
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Taylor Swift?
I'm not the biggest fan. She's a bit too pleasant sounding for my taste.
I could see that. She is really popular in younger audiences.
I respect the fact that she writes some of her own music, though.
Yeah, she also really plays the guitar well.
True. I do catch myself singing along to "Bad Blood" sometimes.
It's hard not to. The chorus to that song is awesome.
I don't really know many of her other songs. They blur together for me.
I'm sure you've heard "Shake It Off". I've been listening to that a lot lately.
Oh yeah. That one was all over the radio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, are you suprised that The Chainsmokers have hot the pop music charts?
No. It seems a lot of alternative bands go mainstream pop.
Like whom?
Take No Doubt for example.
Isn't that the group Gwen Stefani was in?
Yes. They were a Ska band, then one of their songs hit the top 40 and they went pop.
Wow, i did not know that.
Yes, it caused strife with the band, they broke up and Gwen went solo.
Amasing! Any other bands that transitioned over from Alternative to pop music?
Oh, lots of them have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Tove Lo song?
I love Body.
That is such a good song.
She has a really unique and interesting voice.
I agree.
I like her song with Nick Jonas.
The one that's called Closer?
Yeah! That one. Did you see the video for it?
Yeah. It was actually really good.
She is a great singer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like pop?
It is just okay for me.
Oh?  Don't like it so much?
I only listen to it when it's on the radio.
Who do you like the least?
One Direction?  They still a thing?
No they split up.
Well good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you listen to the hit music station sometimes?
Yes, I started that in about 2000.  Every day there was a lot of sugar pop back then.
Yeah, I remember.  It was a nice bubble-gum pop era for a few years there.
Yep.  Britney Spears, Nsync, the Bachstreet Boys and others.
For some reason that song "Blue da bee" comes to mind.
Yeah that one was always thrown in there.  Jessica Simpson too.
Yeah, oh my Gosh!  It brings back memories.
For me too.  the late 90's and 2000s were my era when it came to pop.
Mine too, but you're older than me though.  What's that about?
I guess there was'
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still remember the height of pop music
When was that
You know back in the late 90s
That was the height?
You know Spears and Aguilara
They were pretty famous
To teen girls of pop they were the leaders
If you think so
I am certain of that
Well that is an interesting point of view
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into pop music?
Oh yeah. I absolutely love Ke$ha.
Same! I love the song tik tok.
I love that song too even though it is so old now.
What other artists do you like?
I like fergie a lot.
Same. Have you heard any new music by her lately?
No. I have not.
Oh you should see the music video she put out last year.
Sounds cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of CALL ME MAYBE?
It is by Carly.
It was released in 2012.
It has almost a billion views.
She likes the guy that mows her yard.
She keeps looking at him from inside her house.
He does not know she is looking at him.
He is very handsome.
And he takes his shirt off.
She almost dies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best pop artist of all time?
I think some people would say Madonna, but I'm still gonna say Britney.
Britney Spears? She doesn't have the durability of Madonna!
She may not, but I think she will still be forever the world's best and most popular.
Well, she does have commercial value, I just don't know if her music can really be called great.
Well, music tastes are always subjective, but I bet everyone can sing along to her music.
More people than can sing "Like a Virgin"?
Sure, sure. But "Hit me Baby" and "Oops I did it again" will get there in another ten years.
I still don't see them lasting the test of time.
They have already lasted almost twenty years. That's a long time for music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This is going back a ways, but the Beach Boys really were a good band.
Would  you call the rock or pop?
At the time rock, but now its clearly pop
I get around was such a hit!
So was Barbara Ann!
They wrote some great riffs!
Yeah and people still like their music today
I guess thats the true test, huh?
Yes and thats why I think they are such a great pop band
They had a real variety in the kinds of music they wrote and sung.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Ariana Grande?
I think that she has one of the best voices in music today.
Totally agree. Even in very poppy songs like Break Free, she is able to demonstrate great vocal range.
Yeah, I would even argue that her voice is better than Adelle's voice.
I totally disagree with that statement. I think Hello was one of the top vocal performances ever by a female artist. I think it ranks up there with Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You. It was that spectacular.
Hello was a great performance, but I wouldn't say that it was one of the best vocal performances ever. My problem with Adelle is that she'll have one great single on an album that causes everyone to overrate the other songs on the album.
Really? Could you provide an example of that?
Sure, while Rolling in the Deep was a great single off of her 21 album, songs like Someone Like You and Rumour Has It were nowhere in the same league.
What about Set Fire to the Rain? Adelle's vocal range on that song was ridiculous.
I'll concede that Set Fire to the Rain was better than my two aforementioned songs. However, it was still probably not as good as Rolling in the Deep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was really interested in how well Ariana Grande's Manchester show did to help raise money for the bombing victims, so I went to look it up online.
I heard it was a sold-out show. With Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, and Katy Perry joining Ariana, I can imagine those tickets sold really fast.
Yeah, and you know those people are going to need a lot of financial help, funerals, medical bills, follow up care.
So how much did the show raise?
That was what was confusing. The first ten results on the Google page all showed different results.
Was it because of the difference in dollars and euros?
No. It said in millions- $13, E2, $9, E2.35, $3, $12, $2.6, $3, and E10. The numbers were all over the place.
That seems strange. You would figure tickets sales would be a pretty static number.
Unless they are somehow adding other donations in there. But it makes it seem suspicious that no one is reporting the same number.
Maybe they just have really bad press communications.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There was a new article yesterday about an interview with Louis Tomlinson, who used to be in One Direction.
Is he putting out new music?
Yes, it said he's working on a second single that should be coming out soon.
His first solo single did really well, I think it was number two on the charts or something like that.
Most of the article was him whining about how the music biz people are much more interested in Harry Styles, and how he always gets ignored.
Wow, a little jealousy going on there, huh?
A lot of jealousy- how he can't get a hit songwriter to write for him, but Harry doesn't have that problem. How he was always stuck in the back row of One Direction, and was the only one to never get solos.
It's not Harry's fault if he's a better singer, or more charasmatic and all the girls like him.
He also spoke about how he could see he was forgettable sometimes, and how when his mom died, he didn't have her to comfort him anymore when he questioned his ability.
Well, that sounds like he knows he's not as popular or as good as Harry, but there's no excuse to have a chip on his shoulder about Harry's popularity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever hear pop music?
Yeah I love pop music.
Who is your favorite?
I like christina aguliera.
I like her too! What song is your favorite?
I like the song walk away.
Oh that song is fantastic.
I miss her music.
Me too. But she is good on the voice.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Martin Solveig?
He has a lot of good dance tracks right?
Yes that his him.
Yes I like him.
Have you heard his new stuff?
No I dont think so.
It is a fun dance song, it's called Places.
I will give it a listen.
It is really fun to dance to.
Ok thanks for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What band was your most favorite pop band?
Duran Duran
How about your favorite pop singer?
Billy Idol
Why is this?
At the height of their careers it seemed they couldn't put out rotten if they wanted too.
Name some Duran Duran songs you like.
RIO, Hungry Like A Wolf, Save A Prayer, Wild Boys, Notorious
And Billy Idol?
Eyes Without A Face, White Wedding, Flesh For Fantasy
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think about pop music?
I have always loved it/
There are so many people doing pop music these days
yeah,I know but I still can't get enough
So, who is your favorite pop artist?
I love Brittany Spears
Yeah,I really get into her music.
I love her song "Opps I did it again"
I love that song
I wish she would come out with some new hits
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any of Harry Styles' new music?
The guy from OneDirection?
Yeah.  He went solo.
I'm not really into him, but I think I heard one of his new songs.
What was it?
I don't know, but I think it was written with Taylor Swift.
Oh yeah, I love that one!
I didn't care for it much.
Were you a fan of One Direction?
No, so maybe that's why I didn't like this song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite group growing up was The Carpenters.
Yeah, they were pretty good.  How many albums did they make?
11 albums.
Not bad.  Didn't they do tv?
They had five tv specials and a show.
Very nice.  Any top singles?
Three number 1 singles and five number 2.
Impressive.
Too bad she died of anorexia.
Yea, that was a bummer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You really need to listen to One Republic.
Who are they again? The name sounds familiar.
They have a song called "Secrets" which I really like.
I think I know that song!
Yes and they also did a song with Timbaland back in 2006 or 2007 called "Apologize."
Oh now that one I do remember!
It has a lot of memories for me because I met my husband at that time.
Oh how cool!
Yes so the song "Apologize" by One Republic holds a lot of meaning for me.
I can see that! It is a fantastic song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like justin bieber
Yea hes okay
He is a good artist
Im glad all the hyoe about him died down
I kmow now you can focus more on his music
And not the little girls fangirling
Exactly
It's about time
I know i was wondering how long it would take
Im glad it did
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Justin Timberlake a lot?
Not a lot, but when he puts something out I do.
Yeah, it sucks that he never puts out music anymore.
I think the last full length thing he put out was the 20/20 experience.
He must be a perfectionist.  He takes forever, but it's all so perfect.
Well, I don't love everything he does right when he does it.  But later I go back and listen and it's awesome.
Yeah, it's like he's a few years ahead of his time.
At least he drops a few singles every now and then.
Yeah, like that song from Trolls.
Right.  Who else could make a kids' song so cool?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like that song by mark ronson
Which one is that
Uptown funk
Yes i love that song
Its such a great party song
Yes it is
And it is so catchy
Yes, i play it all the time,
I love listening to it
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think anyone will ever take Michael Jackson's crown as "The King of Pop?"
I highly doubt it. There's some really good artists out there that seem to definitely have the respect and clout though!
Who do you think would get close?
I think the first person who comes to mind is Justin Timberlake. He definitely has been trying to emulate Jackson since N'Sync!
Do you think any new artists get close?
I think The Weeknd is going to be next. He sounds so close to Michael Jackson! I could totally hear him doing a cover of Man In the Mirror and it just being super close to Jackson
I wonder if The Weeknd wrote something more like Jackson if it would resonate with the public though. Pop is so different from the days of Jackson.
I think that Jackson is timeless. It's why every Halloween every knows and does the dance from Thriller. No one in pop comes close!
I guess that's true. JT and The Weeknd seem like they would be next then!
Only time will tell. But I don't think you can replace Jackson!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop act
I love Ariana Grande
Isn't she some kind of Disney star?
Well, she used to be on Nickelodeon when she was younger, but she's made a new name for herself
I've never heard her songs though, what song is she known for
Well, she was first known for her collabs
Who did she collab with?
One of her most famous songs, One Less Problem, featured Iggy Azalea
Oh I know that song! What is her most recent song?
Her most recent famous song was Into You
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite pop artist that people don't know?
Abra Moore!
Who is that?
Exactly.
Right, I got you. Tell me about her.
She had an album out in 1997 and had just one mini-hit.
What was that?
Four Leaf Clover.
Not sure I know what it sounds like.
Again, that's what you asked. She has another album in 1995 that was good, an unreleased album, and two more that didn't chart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Spice Girls were my favorite pop group.
Mine too. I love so many of their songs.
My favorite is Too Much.
I love that song, but my most favorite is Wannabe.
I think that song is what they're most famous for.
Yeah, you're right. I think even my dad knows that song.
Haha. My dad always teases me about the music I used to listen to
Mine too. He is always bringing up 'Nsync and The Backstreet Boys.
That's so funny. I used to play 'Nsync's song Bye Bye Bye over and over.
Me too. Everytime I hear it, it takes me back to my younger days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Pop Music?
I do. I think I like Brittney Spears the most.
Really?? I loved her in the 90s, but not so much now.
Yea, I hate to admit it, but I like her old stuff and her new stuff.
Yea. She does have some good new songs. Oh, and she is pretty.
True. But what about Justin Bieber? You like him?
His music is okay, but I don't like him as a person.
Yea. I'm kind of the same way, but I also don't like his music.
Yea, I just wish he was a better role model.
You're telling me!!! He is too much like a spoiled rich kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When you think of pop music, what singer or group do you think of?
Britney Spears, in her day she was great.
My son had a huge crush on her, of course I think all of the boys did.
She was adorable. I liked all of her songs.
Whitney Houston had a lot of hit pop songs too.
She had the most beautiful voice I have ever heard, I love the song I Want to Dance with Somebody.
My favorite song of her's is I Will Always Love You.
That was Dolly Parton's song. Dolly made it country and Whitney made it pop.
They both did a great job with that song. Funny how a different a song can be when sung by someone else.
Yeah, I also love the song she sang Run To You.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My mom is a huge Elvis Presley fan. Do you like Elvis?
He's great, Old school of course.
He was around during the birth of Rock and Roll. Its king.
So which songs do you like?
Heartbreak Hotel is heartbreaking.
I agree with that.
And then Hound Dog and Blue Suede Shoes are fun.
He was a great dancer too.
Mmm hmm.  Kind of new for the era.
His charisma came through in his music, and everything he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lorde's new album...
God, yes!
I can't stop listening to it. I wasn't even expecting it to be this good.
I know! Green Light was great, but...the album. Wow.
The Louvre makes me cry. I don't know why.
So much emotion! The whole album has me feeling like that.
Right? You can just hear her heartbreak, I swear.
Especially in Liability.
Oh god yeah, talk about a cry fest!
It's so good though. So good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what pop music do you think is the best for a work out?
bruno mars!
okay, aside from bruno mars. he's overplayed
a little. okay, i guess the chainsmokers are pretty good. very upbeat
upbeat is good for a work out, but they're not quite my thing
not even roses?
nah. that song is pretty good, but not for a work out!
honestly, i listen to the killers when i work out.
what? how?!
i don't know! pop rock pumps me up more than just pop
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whos your favorite artist.
I love katy perry
Shes really talented
Who do you like
I think ed sheeran is my favorite
Hes really good too
They both put out good pop songs
I like roar by katy perry
Thats a great song
Very empowering
XXXXXXXXXXX
What genres make up pop music?
I think any genre can end up being pop music?
What do you mean?
It's called "cross over". If a track is huge within a genre, it will leave the genre and become pop music.
I see, but what genres are most likely to generate pop hits?
I'd say most pop music comes from the country, dance, Latin, urban, and rock genres.
What makes a track, as you say, cross over?
I think it's how catchy the track is. Some of these pop hits are addictive.
I know what you mean. I can't get them out of my head!
Yes, that's called the "hook". Most pop music has a hook which catches your attention.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
hey whats up
nothing much
Cool Cool
Want me to put some music on
Sure thing whatcha got
I only got some pop
Thats great play some Nikki Minaj
I got some coming right up
Coolio
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that jam by Shawn Mendes?
I dont think so, what is it called?
It is a powerful song, called There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back.
What does it sound like.
It is super up beat and energizing.
Wow I like those songs.
Yes it is like taking an emotional ride, its great.
I want to hear it.
Yes he is a great musician.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Katy Perry has tried to make peace with Taylor Swift?
No way!  That fight has been going on for song long I don't remember what it was about.
I guess she finally said that she is sorry and forgives her and wants to move on.  She even said she loves her!
That is a pretty big change, especially since she just released a song about her.
I didn't know she released a song about Taylor Swift.
Yeah, it's called Swish Swish and it sounds pretty much like a fight song to me.
I haven't heard that one yet.  I did hear the Bon Appetit song though, it was ok.
I saw the video for that one.  It is pretty weird.
What makes it so weird?
Basically its a video where Katy is food and they prepare her dinner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm going to defend Justin Bieber.
You're a 33-year old man who hates pop music. What could you say?
Look, no one is jealous of him, like his supporters say.
Clearly.
We hate him because he's a completely entitled, immature jerk who gets away with petty crime.
True, but Ellen forgave him, so we have to!
Funny. Anyway, he's insanely musically talented.
How so?
He can sing in many genres. He plays a lot of instruments: trumpet, piano, guitar, drums.
Yeah, true, but he's still a jerk.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Chained to the Rhythm yet?
Sadly, yes.
Why so negative?
I can't stand Katy Perry. And the music video is awful.
Why do you hate her? She's such a good force for acceptance.
Because she can't sing.
Excuse me? She's a multi-millionaire pop singer.
Yes, but have you heard her live and without autotune? She can't do it!
How do you know? You haven't seen her live.
She was on carpool karaoke and stunk it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved Taylor Swift's 1989 album.
Me too! I think it's her best one yet.
Rumor has it she will be releasing a new album by the end of the year.
I sure hope so. I wonder if she wrote songs about Calvin Harris.
I'm sure she did. A lot of her songs are about her relationships.
That's what I love about her music.
Me too! Her songs are so relatable.
Yeah and since they're based on her experiences, you know they came from her heart.
I hope she goes on tour next year.
Me too! Let's go together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Honestly, I really like pop music! People bash on it, but it's just light and fun.
True! It's nice to just have something to put on in the background.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I can't stop listening to Taylor Swift's new stuff.
Haha, I guess she is pop now, isn't she?
For sure. But Bad Blood is so good.
And Blank Space is great too!
They've both got this sort of angry energy. It makes me get so pumped up!
Yeah, that's a good feeling. I also like slower stuff.
Like what?
Ed Sheeran is really relaxing to me. I just love his voice, it's so soft and mellow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
OMG i love this song
Whatcha listening to
I am listening to some katy perry
Sounds fun
She is a doll
Absolutely she is pretty too
Oh for sure she is
Yeah one of the better pop stars i think
I think for her age definitely
Yeah she reaches the right demographic
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Ed Sheeran album?
Yes, I just listened to it! I really liked the song "Dive".
That was a great song, though my favorite was "Shape of You".
That's a great song! How many albums does he have out anyway?
He has 5 albums out, including his EP.
Awesome! I'll have to listen to his other albums.
Did you know that he also has written songs for other artists?
Yeah, I know he's written for Justin Bieber, One Direction, and quite a few other artists.
Wow, I didn't realize he had written for so many other people! He's extremely talented.
I agree, especially since he performs most of his music with just a guitar and a loop pedal!

Don McLean's popular song "The Day the Music Died" suggests that pop music could abruptly end. Is this possible?
I don't think so. It's hard to imagine.
Why? Things change quickly.
It seems to me that there will always be music made. And, some of this music will be more popular than others.
Yes, pop music has many admirable qualities.
I agree. It even affects international relations and events.
How so? I thought pop music was shallow and meaningless.
Each nation takes great pride in its music. They show it off at world events such as the Olympics.
That's true. The Irish, for example, are very proud of their Celtic music.
Yes. It's interesting when a type of pop music can become well-known in multiple locations.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Justin Bieber fan.
No,I'm not.
I'm not either but my granddaughter is.
So you have to listen to his songs.
How'd you guess?
Just a lucky guess.

Oh,I feel for you.
Boyfriend is another one.
That's played a lot

Lady gaga is weird but she has a great voice.  I love one million reasons.
Yeah that song is great,  what other songs of hers do you like?
I really like poker face,  it's super catchy.
That song always reminds me of LMFAO and I don't know why.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your Favorite pop star?
My favorite is definitely Katy Perry she has a great energy in her music.
I did really enjoy Hot n Cold her 2008 hit.
I enjoy that song but did not discover her music until teenage dream in 2010.
I liked California Gurls from that album.
I really liked the song I kissed a girl from the album one of the boys which is some of her earlier work.
Did you know she started out doing christian music in the early 2000s?
I had heard about that but I havent listened to any of her ealier music out side of her pop music.
It is actually decent music though her pop music is much better.
I will have to listen to it when I get a chance, and I look forward to her future music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Billy Joel has to be one of the best power pop artists ever right?
Piano Man might be the best song ever written
I prefer Big Shot in his history.
Thats another great song too.
I feel like you could make a playlist of his entire catalog that could last 2 days.
Yes he had an extensive one.
He was from New York
Yes I know he mentions it alot.
Allentown was about a place he lived in
I always thought it was a euphemism for a party.
XXXXXXXXXXX
indie pop is so much better than radio pop
i have to agree
like, all the best pop artists started as indie pop artists
give some examples!
halsey, lorde, like come on...the list writes itself. even calvin was small before he got huge
so whats the difference between pop and indie pop?
production value and authenticity. it's someone writing a song versus a team writing a song
so beyonce isn't indie pop
not even close. sure, she kind of writes her songs but...not
not really, yeah. she just rearranges other people's lyrics, really.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Katy Perry has a new album out called Witness that hit the top of the charts when it came out.
I heard she was coming out with the new album, but didn't know how good it would be.
Apparently the fans have been really supportive of her. She's had 3 songs that hit diamond status for selling over 10 million.
She does have very supportive fans. Women love her feminist songs, and liberals loved her for supporting Hilary.
She's popular all over. The Witness album was at the top of the charts in China, where they call her Ms. Fruit.
Why do they call her that?
Because she wears fruit covered outfits. They even had a special fruit and album deal in China.
Fruit and album? What kind of deal was that?
They gave away a fruit package to everyone buying the album, and called it "Buy an album and get a fruit."
Well, it must have been a good advertising program if she hit the top of the charts there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could go to any pop concert, who would it be?
Well I would have to go with Bruno Mars.
He is so good. Have you heard his new song "What I Like"?
I have. I love it!
It is right up there with "Just the Way You Are" in my book.
I would say that my all time favorite song of his is "Grenade".
That is a good one. He has a way with love songs.
He does, but he also sings some non-love songs.
Name one.
That is easy, Uptown Funk.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into pop music to listen to?
I like Lorde.
What song do you like?
I like Royals but I also like Perfect Places.
Oh I haven't heard of perfect places.
It is on the melodrama album.
Okay I will check it out some time.
Sounds like a plan.
I like the royals song.
Yeah that is her classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best contemporary pop artist?
I think Taylor Swift is.
What about Bruno Mars?
He is good. But, I think Taylor is the best.

Yes. I bought all of them.
Do you like old school pop? Like, Britney Spears?

I've always been a big fan of Selena Gomez.
I do like her! Her songs are always on the radio.
That is usually how I get my fill of pop songs actually. Who do you like?
I will admit to liking Chainsmokers, their music is so catchy.
Same here, I can't help but sing a long every time their song comes on.
I especially love the collaboration they did with Coldplay!
Don't get me started about Coldplay, I've loved them for decades.
Me too! I'm so glad they're still making music years later.
I hope they never stop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you familar with a type of pop music known as bubble gum music?

Like the game Simon Says?

What about as far as pop music goes though?
I guess she's alright. I'm not sure I know many of her songs.
You have to know the one that just came out this summer!
I'm not sure I do, what's it called?
It's called "It Ain't Me."
No, I haven't heard it before.
Are you sure? They play it all the time on the radio these days.
Maybe I'd recognize it if I heard it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't like much pop but there were some artists I really liked when I listened to the radio the other day.
Any examples?
Whoever sings that 'Call me Maybe' song. Her voice wasn't bad.
No, and that song is fun and upbeat.
I find myself singing it sometimes.
It is definitely not your type of song.
I agree. Normally I find pop lyrics banal.
They can definitely be that.
Plus there's that auto tune.
Ug, that's horrible. It sounds bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about pop music who is your favorite pop star of all time.
Of course the King of Pop Michael Jackson.
What is your favorite Michael Jackson video.
You know it's Thriller of course
I like that also. But I really like the the Pepsi commercial
I guess they were good
i like Thriller video i like the makeup artist  work

Truck drivers used to call Deborah Harry "Blondie".
What was their first album?
Blondie, 1976.
And the second?
Plastic Letters, 1978.
What was their big song?
"Heart of Glass".
Yes, that was a fun song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The pop music industry is saying that Ed Sheeran's popularity is damaging to the music business.
How can popular music be bad for the business?
His third album came out in March, and 16 of his songs were in the top 20. So they are saying this is bad for the other artists trying to get on the charts.
Well. if he's that popular, and everyone else isn't, it's not his fault.
A lot of it has to do with how they count sales with both streaming and sales. But now they are proposing a new rule.
Because of Ed Sheeran being popular?
Yes, they are proposing a maximum of three singles by a lead artist in the singles chart.
That doesn't seem fair. If people like his music that much, he should be allowed all top 20 spots if he earns them.
Some people think because they don't add in things like youtube views, it doesn't properly reflect what people listen to.
Youtube shouldn't count, because it's not a sale, and sales are what the charts have always rated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite song playing on the radio today?
I like Work by Rhianna.
Have you heard Ed Sheeran's new song Shape of You?
Yes, I love how easy it is to dance to.
Did you know Ed Sheeran is from Ireland?
No, that would explain why some of the songs on his album sound Irish.
What do you like best about Bruno Mars?
His music is so full of energy and his live performances are incredible!
Do you like the Chainsmokers?
I haven't heard of them, but the name sounds cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Lorde's new album?
Melodrama? I thought it was really good.
So did I. It's amazing how she managed to improve upon Pure Heroine.
I'm not sure it's as good as Pure Heroine, but it's still really good.
Most important is that she managed to challenge herself.
I think so, too. She really manages to go above and beyond.
She's one of the few pop stars to really play with the genre.
I think Lorde and HAIM do that the best.
I can see that. They both work on their craft.
They both definitely prove there's more to pop music than what you hear on Top 40.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Britney Spears pop?
Yes
What about 98 Degrees?
Yes, they are too
Do you like pop?
There are some great pop songs. My favorite is from Paula Abdul
Oh, I love her stuff.
Is Time After Time a pop song?
Yes
That might be the best pop song ever
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like that pop song that was popular in the 80s
Can you describe the song
It was up beat and fast
Who sung it
A girl i think it was about some sexual stuff
Oh you mean She bop
Yeah that one it is catchy
Well the beat is nice
Honestly i need to set it as my ringtone
I can help you if needed
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about pop music?
I really don't.
Well, okay, I'm asking you to think about it.
I guess I'd say that it all sounds the same to me.
All about meeting someone you'd like to hook up with?
Yeah! And you know I can't relate to that.
Yeah. My own pet peeve about it is the vast number of times they throw "yeah" and "tonight" into a song.
I know what you mean! It's like they're not even trying.
Yeah, there have been some really well written pop songs in the past though.
I kinda like Fun's song I Wanna Be The One.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the old days of pop music.
Oh yeah? Like what?
You know, boy bands. Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera.
I mean, they are all still around.
But they aren't the same! and I can't listen to that One Direction garbage.
You're too picky. Pop music can mean so much. Stop being stuck in the past.
I just really like 90s pop.
What else do you listen to?
Mostly just top 40s stuff.
So much of that is Pop!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about country music making the pop music genre?
I think they should keep them seperate.
I do too. I think it forces artist to try to make music that will get into both markets.
Then they can increase revenue.
But plain pop music is the best. Have you heard of Onereplublic?
Counting Stars! Yes!
I've heard Katy Perry is making a come back too.
Who? What does she sing?
Last Friday night?
Oh yeah. Yeah of course. And dark horse too?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into pop music at all?
Oh yeah I like Pink a lot.
Oh I love pink too.
What song?
I like the song so what?
Oh I love that song I also like just give me a reason.
That song is good.
She is amazing in concert.
I have not seen her yet.
Definitely go when you get the opportunity
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Madonna?
Oh I love her, The Material Girl is the best.
She sure is, what's your favorite track?
It's like trying to choose a favorite child honestly, but Papa Don't Preach probably.
Great choice, but I'm partial toward Like a Prayer.
That's also a great choice, guess I'm mostly a fan of her early 80's stuff.
Oh it was absolutely her best period overall, so many classics. Can't believe she's still going strong.
She has talent in spades, that certainly helps.
Agreed, she's also a surprisingly decent actress.
Absolutely, you won't confuse her with an award winner, but she's certainly more than adequate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any good pop music recently?
Yeah I have been listening to Halsey.
Oh cool, what song?
I have been listening to Now or Never.
Is that new?
Not really.
Oh cool. I have not really listened to her that much.
You should try to, she is amazing.
Maybe I will buy some of her albums.
You should definitely do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Cher?
She is a singer, right?
Yes, she isn't as popular now, but she used to be on the radio all of the time!
What are a few of her famous songs?
She released songs called Believe & If I Could Turn Back Time
I've heard of those!
She is pretty old at this point. But I think she is still making music.
How old is she now?
She is 71 years old.
That is incredible. I hope that she finds some more success, even in her old age.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are so many good pop songs coming out this upcoming summer, what's your favorite?
My favorite is definitely, "Despacito" by Justin Beiber.
I absolutely LOVE that song! He is for sure the Pop King of our time!
He definitely is! I'd have to say my second favorite is, "Everyday" by Ariana Grande.
Her voice is amazing. She is able to hit such high notes, and the added hip hop is such a good touch with Future.
Yeah, pop always sounds nice when it has some rap verses in it.
I agree! Have you gone to any pop concerts lately?
Fifth Harmony is coming to California soon, I may check them out.
Good thinking! My favorite in that pop group is Normani for sure.
She definitely has an amazing voice. I love their song, "Work From Home".
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have been getting into Taylor Swift stuff lately.
You know, she writes most of her own stuff.
I think she writes a lot for others as well.
She may have started country and went on to pop, but she is really a singer song writer.
Her song's are all really full and have a really good narrative.
Even her earlier stuff did.
Yes, like Love Story and Our Song.
She was just a teen when she made that one.
I think she is the best singer to come from the decade she did.
Yes, way better than people like Miley Cyrus or Katy Perry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pop music is so bad nowadays!
You're crazy. There is so much great pop music out there!
Like who? What artists do you like?
Jessie J is one of my favorites!
She is a British singer, right?
Correct. Her voice is incredible.
What are your favorite songs?
She has an older song called "Ain't Be Done" that is phenomenal.
What is it about?
The lyrics are all about empowering women and girls and doing things that nobody thinks you are capable of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you listen to a lot of pop music?
Yeah I do.
Who are some of your favorites?
Well I like Lady Gaga quite a bit.
Do you have her new album yet?
Yeah I love it.
What's that new song called?
The cure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lady Gaga?
Actually I was never a fan of most of her music, but I loved her on American Horror Story.
Did she do a good job acting?
I think she did, but maybe she just matched her character.
What do you mean by that?
Well, I think she's a bit odd and her character was odd, so maybe it wasn't a stretch.
Oh, well are there any songs of hers that you do like?
I really liked You and I.  I loved it and I was surprised when I found out it was her.
Yeah, it shows she can really sing.
Yeah, she can.  She's just a bit peculiar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you heard of Julia michaels?
She sings that issues song right?
Yes and she is also a songwritter too.
Anything or anyone  I would know?
Rita Ora, Beiber, Fifth harmony,Selena Gomez and ed sheeran.
Oh wow she has worked with a lot of artist already.
She has indeed. I am glad she is coming out with her own stuff now.
It is always weird to think of a new emerging talent as already so connected behind the scenes.
Yes it is. Similar to Sia as well.
Ya, I was also shocked to learn of her songwritting past.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the actual pop prince?
Well, they say Micheal Jackson.
You know, I do not even like his stuff that much.
He was one of the mot successful artists ever.
But most his songs sounded the exact same.
How so?
Well, Billy Jean sounds just like Man in The Mirror.
But, the lyrics are so different.
Not really, every one of songs are just the same, varying words.
Well, there is always Prince.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear The Spice Girls are reuniting?
No. Are you serious?
Yeah, but only Geri, Emma, and Mel B are coming back.
Oh, so know Posh or Sporty Spice?
Nope.
That's too bad. I know they all went on a reunion tour around a decade ago.
Yeah they did. I wish I could have seen it.
Me too. I really love all their songs.
I know some of them have went on to have solo singing careers.
Yeah, I've listened to a few of Emma's songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you listen to pop music.
Yeah sure.
Who are some of your favorite pop stars?
I like Bruno Mars and Adam Levine.
He is in Maroon 5 right?
Yeah that's right.
I like a lot of their songs.
Moves like Jagger is my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
demi lovato's lyrics are so bad!
wow, yikes...
they are! and it's sad, because she's the former disney princess with the best vocals
her lyrics aren't that bad...
she once said "bounce like a basketball" unironically in song. so.
okay, she did that...once
i'm just saying. she might not be as bad as miley, but she's up there
come on! you can't compare demi to that wreckingball
i can and i will!
she's still a better singer than selena, i don't care
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think rap counts as pop music?
Wow that's a good question.
I think it does.
I think hip hop counts as pop music.
What's the difference between hip hop and rap?
Hip hop, to me, is more of the pop music of rap.
So you think hip hop is the pop music of rap?
Yeah I would say that. Hip hop is more of the catchy fun songs like pop music is.
I guess that is true.
I think any music can really be pop music.  It literally means popular music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like how catchy pop is
I know right
It is not to complex which is good
More complex does not make better
Exactly their is a value in simplicity
Got to take in both spectrums
I know exactly
Ignoring one for the other is ignorance
Precisely how i feel
Good thoughts then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite female pop singer?
My favorite female pop singer is Katy Patty.
What is your favorite Katy Patty song?
My favorite Katy Patty song is her latest "Chained To The Rhythm".

The artist that is also featured to this song is Skip Marley.
Did Katy Paty also performed in the Superbowl a few years back?
Yes, a couple of years ago at Super Bowl 49.
She had a fantastic performance at that event.
It was one of the most memorable performances at any Super Bowl. Katy Paty is one of the best singers out there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of modern pop music?
I think it all sounds the same.
Couldn't say that about pop music when we were kids?
Yeah, but todays music is all computer generated.
I'm so glad they quit using auto-tune.
They still use it but no like in that T-Pain style anymore.
I like some of the pop music but most of it is garbage to me.
It really does seem disposable.
What do you mean disposable.
The songs aren't songs that 3 to 6 months you will even remember.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard all the new Ed Sheeran songs?
I don't think I've heard them all.
Be sure to listen to Castle on the Hill.
Is that one good?
Yes it is so emotionally powerful.
Wow I like how music can move me like that.
That's exactly what this song does, it is powerful.
He is so great.
Yes he writes amazing songs and sings them beautifully.
I agree, thank you for mentioning this, I am looking forward to listening to this song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the best female pop star.
There were a lot of really great female pop stars, that is hard to choose.
I think most people would say Maddona.
She did have a lot of hits.
Material Girl, Like A Virgin.
I think she laid the way for other pop stars.
I think Lady Gaga draws a lot from her.
Some of her songs are very similar.
I think the song Judas is just like something Madonna would sing.
I think the one called Given Me a Million reasons draws hard from Madonaa.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, tell me who is your favorite pop music artist?
Well, I love Katy Perry
I think she's rather innovative with all her music videos
Yes! they're all so unique and amazing
I wish other artists were as unique as her

I would have to say my favorite is The Chain Smokers.
Really? Their music is so generic.
Well, everything sounds similar today.  Who would you say your favorite artist is?
I'd have to say my favorite right now is Bruno Mars.
Seriously? And you think The Chainsmokers are a bad choice?
Hey, Bruno Mars has a lot of range and you can't deny his style.
He's just trying to be new Michael Jackson and you know it.
Well you've seen that youtube video where a person recreated every chain smoker song right?  Their music is so generic.
Well agree to disagree.  You do you and I'll do me.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I think it makes the album more special. It is different from Lady Gaga's other albums.
I have to agree with you on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to pop music?
I like older pop music from the 90's, but I will listen to newer stuff.
What bands did you like from the 90's?
I was a huge boy band nerd. I loved BSB and N'Sync
I was secretly a fan as well, but we can't admit that!
Right?  I also like newer pop like Bruno Mars and Adele
Yeah, Adele has some pipes on her.  I think Bruno put on a great SuperBowl show
I agree, he really took it to another level.
We need more artists like him out there
Yes, he is a modern Michael Jackson.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Drake track yet?
I don't think so.
It is called Passionfruit.
Ok that is a fun song name.
Yes the song is special, he is a talented guy.
What does it sound like.
Like the song name, and the fruit, it is a very sweet track.
Ok I like the sound of that.
Yes it is mostly instrumental then he sings harmonious lyrics.
Ok I could see myself enjoying that, thank you for mentioning it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think taylor swift is pop or country?
Definitely pop
Yea thats what i think too
Theres really no country about her
Nope all pop
Do you like her music?
Some of her songs
Me too
A lot of her songs sounds repetitive
Yes i agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the latest Katy Perry songs?
I havent heard her newest stuff yet.
She has this one song, Chained to the Rhythm, it is excellent.
I like her music.
This song is extra special too, she has changed her style a bit from 10 years ago.
She is a smart lady.
Yes her lyrics are great and the energy is spectacular.
That is what I like about her.
This song is a great example of how powerful of a singer she is.
Thank you for telling me about this song, I will listen to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like that James Arthur song, "Say You Won't Let Go."
I do too, everybody likes that song.
It's number eleven on the Billboard pop chart right now.
His voice is so mesmerizing on that song.
I was thinking about how great it would be to hear him singing it live. I checked online, and he's on tour in the US all next month.
Are there still tickets available?
There's a show in New Jersey July 25th, and there are still tickets available for $25.
We could make a road trip out of it and split the gas and expenses.
That sounds like a lot of fun. I'd love to go.
Summer is always a great time to go to a concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop singer and why?
I love Sia. I always can relate to her songs!
I agree. Lots of her songs are about the struggle of...well...being human.
I agree. One of my favorite song from her is "I am in here."
I never heard about that one.
Well yeah, she made it way back before she was elevated to stardom. This was pre "Titanium"
Why do you like the song?
Well, I interpret the song as being lonely. I have been in depression cycles due to my anxiety, and sometimes I felt so alone when fighting the depression.
That is deep. I better listen to the song now.
Yes, you can just play it on youtube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not a huge fan of pop music
I'm sorry, but how?
What do you mean? I just prefer classical.
Okay, but there are so many different artists. So many different genres within pop!
I guess...
You can go from listening to Bruno Mars to Shakira to the Beatles! It's all pop music.
I prefer Mozart.
You're the most boring person I know.
Thanks, man. Thanks a lot.
You're welcome. Now put on That's What I Like by Bruno Mars
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite pop artist?
Michael Jackson, no question.
What do you think he would be doing now if he were still alive?
I'm sure that it would be something new and innovative.
Always, he was nothing if not original
Truly, he really turned the pop world upside down.
His songs were always so well produced.
Yes he had such a great talent.. my favorite song of his was Earth Song.
Yes that was a great one, and I loved Billy Jean
Yes! Thriller was a great album
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard the song by Taylor Swift and Zayn is in the top most played songs this year.
What song is that?
I Don't Wanna Live Forever.  It's off the soundtrack for Fifty Shades Darker.
I don't think I've heard that.
Really?  It's been all over the radio.  Well its sort of died off now but it was played nonstop earlier this year.
One song that I've heard played a lot this year is Ed Sheeran's Shape of You.
I love that song.  It's a lot more pop sounding than most of his other songs.
I heard the guys helping him produce it had it in mind for someone more like Rihanna but then Ed sang part of it and they decided to just go with it for him.
That's really neat.  I like when artists change up their sound a little bit.
Me too, it helps keep things fresh. His Divide album is absolutely fantastic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you consider Talyor Swift to be a pop artist or country.
I think she used to be country, but she's definitly pop now.
Really, I still hear the country in her though.
No way, she moved on from that with Fearless, just listen to that album.
Yeah, I guess the title track is pretty pop.
well, 1989 sealed the deal.  Shake it off it all pop.
Ok, your'e right.  That song is total pop bubble gum.
it sure is, think of all the youtube videos of people dancing and singing to it
Its great.  I love watching the cop drive around singing shake it off
See, only a teeny bop pop song sung by a cop woudl get so many hits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Dad, what is Pop music?
I don't really know. I used to know, but now I am confused...
What do you mean?
Well, when I was young, Pop music was from bands like The Beach Boys...
I remember them!
...And the Beatles...
Another good one!
Yeah, but today, music from those bands are played in elevators, and are called "Oldies"
What were oldies when you were young?
"Itsy bitsy spider" and "Mary had a little lamb..."
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember Nickelback used to be kind of popular.
Yes I kind of liked their music.
Which song was your favorite?
I really liked "How You Remind Me".
Oh yes I remember that one and it was really good.
I'm not sure why some people really dislike them?
That's a good question, I have no idea either. I always loved them.
I did too!
The song "Photograph" by them was great also.
Yes I get that stuck in my head all the time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any favorite pop singers these days?
A few, but currently Taylor Swift is my favorite.
I hope she comes out with a new album soon. It's been a while.
I haven't heard anything about a new album, but I'd love to hear one.
I also have been listening to a lot of Adele lately.
She has such a powerful voice.
I can't remember the last time I've heard anyone sing with as much soul as her.
Yeah, she's like a blast from the past. A real artist who can actually sing.
Did you watch her at the Grammy's?
Yes, her performance was super powerful and gave me chills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like N Sync's performane at the VMAs in 2000?
I thought it was understated
In what manner
I think they are largely overrated
They were the most popular boy band of the 90s!
I dont know if I would say that.
Yes they were larger than New Kids on the Block!
I would agree with you there but I hated their sound
Most of their guys went on to do bigger things as well
Surprised they were able to break the mold
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music have you been listening to these days?
Mostly pop. I'm totally obsessed with pop music.
Who are some of your favorite artists? I love that new Bruno Mars song "That's What I Like."
ME TOO! I love that song. No matter what I'm doing it always makes me want to dance. Besides Bruno I like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ed Sheeran, Halsey, etc. I could go on forever.
Do you like Katy Perry's new song Swish Swish? I just saw her perform that on Saturday Night Live.
Yes! I saw that! I've read some bad reviews of her new album Witness, but so far I like every song I hear from it.
I like Ed Sheeran's newest album, especially "Shape of You." Did you see him on Carpool Karaoke a few weeks ago?
Yes, he was totally adorable. I watched it twice.
You need to help me discover some new pop music. Who's someone new I can listen to?
Well, if you haven't listened to the Chainsmokers, Paramore, or Sia, I'd definitely recommend them. Those are three more of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your all time favorite pop singer?
Its Britney.....
Really? Even after her 2007 meltdown?
Yes, it made her so much more relatable as a person.
Whats your favorite song from her?
There are so many BUT  i love....old school late 1990's early 2000 Britney.
Who was your favorite Brit. Boyfriend?
That's not even a question JT....even though I love him with Jessica Alba so much more.

Shes pretty great
Her songs are so relatable
And shes full of energy
Yes she is
She is one of the best artists
I agree with that
She also has a great stage presence
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Pop music?
I mean, it is such a big genre every one is bound to like something from it.
Everything from the Beatles to Katy Perry.
I think the best pop artist would have to be David Bowie.
I think he was really a game changer for pop music.
He made the genre be something more.
I like the way he mixed a bit of rock in .
Starman is one of the best songs I have ever heard in my life.
I loved Changes. I think it changed, get it, the whole genre.
He influenced so many other stars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite female artist?
It has to be Taylor Swift.
I remember when her music came out a few years ago.
Her first song was Teardrops on my Guitar.
What songs do you like of hers from current pop hits?
I really like Shake It Off and 22.
Those are some great pick me up songs.
They put me in such a good mood.
Her songs used to be kind of depressing.
Yeah, but now it's less sad love songs and more pop sounds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Taylor Swift?
Do you mean her music?
Yes. Do you like her songs?
She has some good ones.
I like a few too.
My favorite is We Are Never Getiing Back Together.
Me too.
She is pretty.
She's from Pennsylvania.
I didn't know that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your favorite pop song at the moment?
I really like Ed Sheeran's "Shape Of You".
Awesome! I like that one too, it's my ringtone for my boyfriend!
Seriously?! That's so cool, it's a great song for sure!
Yeah, it is! Do you like anything by Justin Bieber?
YES! I love the song "Let Me Love You".
Great minds think alike! Same here! That's my number one fave at the moment.
Too cool! Isn't it written by DJ Snake?
Yes, DJ Snake is the artist and JB is featured in the song.
That's what I thought! Awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the new song from Ed Sheeran, "Galway Girl"?
Yeah, I really love that song and his new album is amazing!
Oh, I know! Have you heard his song, "Happier" on his album?
Yes, it is such a soft and romantic song!
Did you know that Ed Sheeran wrote Justin Bieber's song, "Love Yourself"?
What? No! I did not know that.
Yeah, he has actually written over 18 songs and he's only 24 years old!
He is such an amazing artist.
Would you want to go to one of his concerts?
Oh my gosh, yes! That would be so amazing to see him play and sing live!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Shall we talk about pop music? Britney Spears is my favorite pop artist.
Oh! I love Britney, I actually got to see her at a show recently.
Yes I've loved her since I saw her her 2002 movie "Crossroads".
That's a great movie! I really liked her rendition of "I Love Rock 'n' Roll".
Me too! I'd say she probably did Joan Jett and the Blackhearts justice, do you agree?
Totally I really liked the way she sung it, I might even like it better than the original version!
What do you think of Lana Del Rey?
I think she's great, I really love her songs "Young and Beautiful" and "High By The Beach".
Those are some of my favorite songs by her too! I can't believe how much we have in common.
I know right! I really love pop music so it's cool to get to talk to someone with similar tastes about it, I don't get to very often.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just won a contest on the radio.  I had to sing a lyric from the Ed Sheeran Castle on the HIll son
Congrats but I do not like Sheeran, I prefer different music and artists.
I also tried to win Bruno Mars ticket
I have Bruno Mars' song Thats WHat I like as my ring tone.
What other pop songs are you into these days?
Lady Gaga is my female kick butt singer and performer
Lady Gaga?  I only listened to her once, when she sang at the Super Bowl.
She is awesome and I remember her amazingly crazy but unique costumes, such as arriving to an awards show in an egg.
Remember when I was in high school, pop music was NSYNC and Britney Spears.
I love the music of today, Ed Sheeran and Lady Gaga are amazingly unique.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into pop music at all?
Yeah I am into Demi Lovato.
Oh cool.
I like the song Everytime you Lie.
Oh I have not heard that yet.
You should definitely check it out.
I will listen to it on itunes next time.
What pop artists do you like?
I like listening to selena gomez.
Oh I haven't heard much of her to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite pop artist?
I like Taylor Swift!
Cool. Isn't it funny that she started off as a country singer?
Yeah, but even then she wasn't super country. She is better as a pop singer for sure.
I liked 1989, but haven't really followed her, even though she seems to be everywhere.
That's a great album! Who do you like?
I'd have to say Madonna!
She rocks!
Yeah, I've been singing her songs since I was a toddler. I remember dancing to Vogue.
I think my favorite song of hers is Frozen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a Backstreet Boys and an N'sync fan?
Totally N'sync, although I quietly like Backstreet Boys too.
Me too, crazy how you could only declare to be a fan on one because high school works that way!
Seriously, how silly kids can be especially when it comes to pop music.
What's even crazier is that one guy was the writer for both albums.
Really?  Who is that?
Max Martin, he is literally behind a huge number of top 40 pop hits for the last two decades.
Who else did he work with?
He has written songs for Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Pink, Beyoncé, Bon Jovi, and a ton more.
Wow, he is a king of pop for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite pop band?
Probably One Direction.
Yeah, they have a lot of good songs.
They do, and not bad to look at either.
What Makes You Beautiful is a very good song.
It is.
Sad they started going separate ways.
One Thing was another favorite song of mine.
That was good.
Those guys have talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about pop music we like, would you like to go first?
I suppose I'll join in. Although I like older pop music, like 1980s. Rick Springfield is someone I like.
He was a big hit in the 1980s. I remember Jessie's Girl was his big hit.
Springfield had over 8 top 40 hits, and won multiple Grammy awards!
I did not know that. He was popular with my sister, I remember that. What do you think of Justin Timberlake?
Timberlake is really talented, and super funny on Saturday Night Live. I liked that song I'm Taking Sexy Back.
That whole album is amazing. I used to work out to Love Stoned also. He has a simmering intensity.
Surprising really, he looks kind of shy until he starts dancing, which he's really talented at.
I heard Janet Jackson and Timberlake were romantically involved. Now Janet Jackson, she kicks it!
Bet they had amazing chemistry. So much raw talent between them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite pop artist
Nothing of this generation
What era then
I love Synth pop
What kinda pop is that
it is a pop with electronic sort of music in it
Wow that is prettty impressive
Yeah it sounds cool doesnt it
Yeah i might like it
Yeah give it a listen
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Katy Perry and her music?
Yes I do! I really like her song "Dark Horse."
That's a good song! I enjoy it also.
She's a little out there these days but I did really like her songs.
I think one of my favorites is "Roar."
That song gets me pumped!
Oh me too! I love to listen to it when I am exercising.
That's a great idea!
Yes it gets me motivated.
I agree, it would me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man pop music is so bad
Do not say that
but why it is the truth
Pop music is the music of all time
Not is not
You are a liar
It is the worst thing i can hear
Lalala i cannot hear you
Well do what makes you feel better
I will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to the radio lately? There's some awesome new pop hits!
I have! Which ones do you like so far this summer?
I really like Bruno Mars' new song, 'That's What I Like.'  I can dance to it all day.
That's a really good song! I have been listening to 'Shape of You' by Ed Sheeran!
Is that his new song? I didn't know that was him!
It is! The song has some really interesting beats.  Super pop!
It's definitely different from his usual love songs.
Right, so different from his previous songs 'Photograph.'
Don't forget his breakout hit, 'Thinking Out Loud.'
That song was really memorable.  I still listen to it from time to time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know the 2 most popular albums from Avril Lavigne?
umm, if I guess right, it's gotta be The Best Damn Thing and Let Go?
you know what, you are absolutely right! I see you are a fan of her.
definitely, I loved her music and I still do
when do you come to know her?
well, I remember vividly that I was actually attracted by her album cover art at first, then I started listen to her music and found it great
yeah, when I was in middle school, songs like Girlfriend and Innocence were so popular, they are like something eternal, you never get bored of them
I feel the same. Do you know when Girlfriend first come out, it has broken many billboard records, Avril even made different language version of it
haha, she's very talented alright?
no doubt, but I like the English version the best
XXXXXXXXXXX
Know what I like?
Strawberry Champagne?
How'd you know?
You've been singing Bruno Mars all day.
I love that song.
Yes, I can tell. I just said you've been singing it all day.
Do you like it?
Yes, but with one slight issue.
Of course you found something. What is it this time?
Strawberry Champagne doesn't exist. I think he means strawberry-flavored bubbly wine. Champagne is super specific.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Sean Paul?
I don't know too much about him to be honest.  What about you?
I am a huge fan.  I love that he brings reggae music and combines it with pop.
Has he won any major awards?
He won a Grammy in 2004 for Dutty Rock.
Is that your favorite song?
I actually love the pop songs he is involved with.  For instance, 'Cheap Thrills' with Sia was so good.
Yea, it's one of the remakes of songs that actually sounds better than the original.
What about your favorite song by him solo?
I really love "Get Busy."
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Elton John's pop music?
Its fun stuff. He's really talented.
Yeah. His music is a little funky, but he's an artist at heart.
Which of his songs do you like?
Old ones like Tiny Dancer, and Crocodile Rock is fun.
Oh, Tiny Dancer is a really nice song.
I think so. It paints a picture.
Any other songs?
Don't let the Sun go Down on Me.
You have good taste in music!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite pop song right now?
My favorite pop song is "Too scared to be lonely".
Who sings this song?
The singer of this particular song is Dua Lipa.
Is Dua Lipa a new singer?
I would say yes she is fairly new to the Pop genre.
Does she have any other songs that are good?
Yes. She has a new song with Sean Paul but I don't remember the title of it.
How is her singing voice like?
She is a very talented singer. Her voice is really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you love Barenaked Ladies?
Who doesn't? They're awesome.
You know I'm talking about the pop band, right?
Of course. What else do you mean?
Nevermind. But good for you, I guess.
My favorite is Grade 9, for some reason.
Why is that odd?
Well, they make a lot of references of 9th grade.
Sounds like something you'd like since you're super nostalgaic.
Yeah, but they're a good decade older than me. Yet I still got the references.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some of your favorite pop artists?
Hmm, well I really like Sufjan Stevens and Neutral Milk Hotel
Oh, so you're into the indie stuff huh?
Yeah, mostly. What about you?
I like indie stuff as well, but also like all kinds of stuff as far back as the 60's and 70's like Don McLean and the Beatles
I love the Beatles too. I'm not as familiar with Don McLean as you probably are though.
Not many people are! I'm a huge fan
What did he do besides American Pie?
Well tons of stuff, but his most famous ones would probably be Starry Starry night, aka Vincent
oh right, i know that one. Beautiful song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite pop artist?
To be Honest I really like Justin Beiber as his songs are so catchy.
No judgement here, I realy like What Do You Mean.
I like that song and most of his recent work, though I am not really a fan of his early work.
Yeah, I am also not a fan of Baby era Beiber but he is talented.
Did you know he was discovered by usher?
I had heard that he used to make videos on Youtube and that is how usher discovered him.
And then not long after that My World 2.0 was released in 2010 (not a fan of this album).
I did not like that album, I was more into lady gaga and katy perry at that time.
They certainly dominated that year but I can see why young girls at the time fell in love with Beiber and the talent that Usher saw in him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's your second favorite pop singer?
well, you know my first was Avril Lavigne right?
yea, you've told me about that before
so I think the second position in my heart belongs to Taylor Swift, to be honest I'm not quite sure what her genere is anymore
yeah, she transformed herself from a country girl style to pop star, definitely a good move to make more money, haha
umm, that's a valid point, but also I think she's getting more mature and don't live in that fairy tale style country music any more?
that could be a valid point as well. But anyway, in the end it's the music that matters
I used to listen to her Love Story and You Belong With Me
I got to know Taylor Swift by listening to You Belong With Me
yeah, me too. That was a very popular song
XXXXXXXXXXX
Madonna is one of the biggest pop stars in the world!
I know! She has been around for decades.
How many albums has she released?
I think she has released 15 or more!
Wow, do you have a favorite?
It is tough to choose. But I think my favorite is MDNA.
Really? Her electronic album?
Yes, I love it! What about you?
I prefer Ray of Light
That one is a masterpiece too. I understand why you picked it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about SZA's progression as a pop star?
Personally,  I like Sza's older stuff, but Ctrl is on another level.
Ctrl was up there with Miseducation if you ask me.
I feel like her music is a fascinating take on R&B - it has a ton of inspiration from indie and left field pop production,
I feel like CTRL, is a vulnerable and beautiful R&B record.
I agree, it is some of her most mature, honest songwriting ever.
Do you know how she met Kendrick Lamar?
No, I never heard how they met.
She first met Kendrick posing as an interviewer, she was signed to TDE that same year.
Wow, that's some Nancy Drew stuff right there. Good for her for getting her foot in the door!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Katy Perry?
Yes she is ok.
I like her song Hot N Cold.
Yes that is a funny video.
She cut her hair too short.
Yes it don't look right now.
Her song Firework was pretty cool too.
Yes and I liked that video too.
Last Friday Night was funny I liked because I was a kid in the 80's.
Yeah that was ok. I liked some of her other ones better though like Wide Awake.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you listen to pop music?
Sure.
Who is your favorite artist?
Well, I really like Katy Perry.  I think she's really fun.
Yeah, she's okay.  I'm not a big fan of her music though.  I prefer Selena Gomez.
Oh yeah, she's great!  She had that one song last summer, what was it?
It was called Good For You.
Yeah, that's it!  She's a great artist.  I'm glad she was able to have a music career after Disney.
Definitely, some great pop artists started in Disney, like Britney Spears.
Oh yeah, her too!  They're both great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot get this song out of my head
Why is it stuck in your head
Well i listened to it once and now i cannot stop hearing it
Well that is your problem
Yeah it sucks
What song is it
I got oops i did it again stuck in my head
oh that is horrible
No No i like the song
Then why complain
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite Hip-hop artist?
I really like Eminem he has a good flow and often an authentic message.
Have you heard I miss you? It is a great song.
I have not heard it yet but I like most of his other stuff.
You know more recently he has been featured with other artists on other tracks instead of doing his own songs as much.
yeah, like Kill For You by skylar grey.
Good song, as he is just as good in that role.
I especially when Eminem and Dr. Dre collaborate.
I need a doctor is one of my favorite songs down by Dr. Dre
Agreed, I really hope to see more songs like that in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Janet Jackson?
I love Janet. I miss her music a lot, actually.
I miss when the Jacksons were basically the pop royally family.
I get that. The 1990s were really magical.
And the 1980s too, when Janet did Rhythm Nation.
And when Michael did Thriller and Bad, you know.
I hear Janet is going out on tour again soon.
Really? We should try to get tickets.
I hope she comes to our town and plays All For You.
I just wanna hear The Pleasure Principle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like bruno mars new album

i liked jukebox better
the last song is incredible.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Do You Think Katy Perry is a top Pop Star?
Of course, Katy Perry is a superb Pop Star, Roar
I love to hear her roar in that song
I like her first song, I kissed a girl, that's what started her career
Do you know she's a CoverGirl?
I love to see her CoverGirl commercials, especially the one when she "Roars"
I have you heard about her latest adventure?
Are you talking about, her being a judge for the new American Idol show?
Yes. She seem excited about being a judge and helping the performers reach their potentials
It's going to be an interesting show, I wonder if she's going to be a stuff Judge?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What you you think about Pink?
The singer?
Yeah, do you like her music?
I love her.  She's great!
Have you ever seen her live?
No, but I heard her shows are really awesome.
Yeah, a couple years ago she had these trapeze things in her act.
Seriously?  That sounds awesome!
My cousin went to one of her shows.  She said it was amazing.
I'm sure it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite artist?
Probably Joni Mitchell, she's got an amazing voice.
So you like folk music? I'm fond of Simon and Garfunkel.
Oh, I like them quite a bit. Pity they're not always on the best of terms.
Yeah. I think they're one of the greatest American duos.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
Probably America, just a beautiful tune.
I hum that tune all the time.
It's incredibly catchy, no? What's yours?
I like Sounds of Silence a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've noticed a dramatic change in pop music.
What's that?
It's a lot more diverse.
I know why. It's because the world is getting smaller.
Yes, we all have access to the music that's popular around the world.
Exactly! I suspect that if a song is popular in one country, it will be popular in another.
Why is that?
I think it's because the human brain likes certain patterns.
And, those patterns are present in pop music?
Yes, most pop songs have a similar structure. It's a structure which is soothing and pleasing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not a fanboy but I liked the song Heathens.
You know,not bad for a pop song.
Yea,a lot of pop songs sound the same.
Too many sound the same
I know what you mean.
I guess it came off the,Suicide Squad album.
Yes it did.
Big album for them.
As a pop band they're not bad overall.
I can stomach some of their songs
XXXXXXXXXXX
What pop music do you listen to.
I like Katy Perry actually.
Yea,she's real good.
Love the song California Girls.
Yea,me too.
How about,Teenage Dreams?
I like that too.
Do you like firework?
Yes,another good one.
All of those were released in 2010.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever listen to Celine Dion?
I can't really stand her.
Really, I always loved her music.
Honestly, I always thought all her music was overplayed.
What song was overplayed?
A lot of them, especially the one from Titanic.
Okay, maybe that one was overplayed, but it's a great song.
It's too sappy.
Maybe it's that kind of music you don't like.
Maybe so.  I really don't like her voice though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the artist Prince?
I thought he was a super interesting guy.
I was so sad when he died.
Yes a big loss for the music world.
His purple rain was everything to me at one point.
I always loved Little red corvette and Kiss most.
He had so many great songs. When doves cry always was one of my favorites.
It was a good one. I loved how unique he was overall.
He really was an original artist. Even his guitar had a unique twist.
He was also a vegan and very active in a lot of charity work too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who's music is amazing?
Who? Someone I know maybe?
I don't know if you know him or not but Ed Sheeran.
Oh I remember him!
Yes I really really love his song "Shape of You."
Yes it has such a great rhythm and beat to it.
It really does! I like to sing to it when I am driving.
Have you heard "Thinking Out Loud"?
Oh I love that one! Such a beautiful voice.
Yes and his voice doesn't match his look either, it's so funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Katy Perry's album Prism?
I thought it was okay.
Yeah, it wasn't my favorite.
I liked her album Teenage Dream the most.
Me too. Peacock is my favorite song.
Really? My favorite is Hummingbird Heartbeat.
Oh, that's not a very popular one.
Not really, but I enjoy the lyrics
What do you think about her song Not Like The Movies?
I think it's very good. I like the soft music in the background.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop singer right now?
I really think Taylor Swift has knocked it out of the park with her pop album.
That was a smart move for her to go more pop than country.
I also really like Demi Lovato.
Have you noticed a lot of child stars turn into pop singers?
I guess you're right.  There's Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez.  The list could go on.
Miley's younger sister, Noah, has a song out right now called Cry.  Have you heard it?
No, is it any good?
I think its great!  Although she sounds exactly like Miley.
Miley Cyrus got kind of crazy there for a while I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite singer?
I've always liked Kelly Clarkson a lot.
I like her too! Have you heard the song Irvine? That's my favorite song she sings.
I love that song. She wrote it herself.
I didn't know she wrote songs too.
Yes, she's written a lot of her own music.
Her voice is so gorgeous.
It is. I've always loved how versatile her voice is.
It is. I remember when she sang Big Band music on American Idol.
Yeah, she sang Stuff Like That There and nailed it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really love Biance, have you heard any of her latest work?
I love her too, she is quite the entertainer.
What is your favorite album of hers?
Dangerously in Love is my favorite!
I liked  Lemonade in 2016.
What songs on there did you enjoy?
Pray You Catch Me and  Hold Up are my favorites on that album.
Sandcastles and Freedom are the ones I like on that one.
She has won many awards for her talent.
I believe she has made over 9 records.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Chance the rapper
I agree he's great
Do you think he's pop music though?
Yes. Same drugs is a great pop song
It really is. Plus he's really popular.
What other pop songs do you like?
Anything by Ed Sheerhan.
Eh, I don't really like him
Shape of you is a great song.
I guess. I like Harry Styles more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you lile that Dollhouse song?
Which one?
The one by Melanie Martinez
I dont know if i heard it
You should look it up
I will
Its a wierd song but very carchy
Ill have to look it up now im interested
I hope you like it
Thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish I would have gone to a pop concert as a kid.
Who was a big group then?
New Kids on the Block.
I would have loved to see them too
Have you seen any pop bands live?
No. But, I play a game where I get to sing old pop songs.
What is it called?
SingStar
That sounds pretty fun.
They have all the best pop groups on there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does that even mean
In regards to what
Well what does the term pop music mean
I guess it stands for popular music
But why does it have on specific sound
Because it is trying to attract a specific audience
Makes sense
And not all pop music is the same
Sounds like it to me
You gotta explore
XXXXXXXXXXX
So is Justin Bieber the king of pop at this point?
He has some good tunes, but what about Bruno Mars?
Good point - "That's What I Like" and "Versace on the Floor" are great new songs.
His voice is the best, especially on "When I Was Your Man" and "It Will Rain".
"Unorthodox Jukebox" was fantastic from top to bottom.
He's an underrated dancer too, and he even plays a mean guitar!
That's right, I saw him cover Prince's "Let's Go Crazy" at the Grammys.
Bruno is about the only current artist who could have pulled that off.
He would be such a fun concert to go see.
For sure, we'll have to go check him out when he's in town.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Latino pop music?
I do!
Have you heard the Bailando song by Enrique Iglesias?
Oh my god I love that song!
Who else sings with Enrique?
I think it's Gente de Zona and Descemer Bueno.
Yeah that sounds about right.
Isn't there one more?
You're right...but I can't think who it is.
It's Sean Paul! That's who it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i was listening to the radio the other day...
and? what happened?
well, the DJ played a justin bieber song...
that's not so out of the ordinary
yeah, but then she played a weeknd song. and then a selena song!
okay, that was definitely on purpose
exactly! at least the selena song was good
what song was it?
heart wants what it wants
oh yeah, that one makes me cry
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Pop Song of 2016?
That is very hard but I love "My House" by Flo Rida
That is a very great song, but I like "Let Me Love You" by DJ Snake and Justin Beiber.
I love that song also. Which one do you think did better on the Billoard charts?
Accroding to the chart "My House" by Flo Rida is number 68, and "Let Me Love You" By DJ Snake and Justin Bieber is 41.
Oh wow I thought that songs would be higher. They both are great songs
Yes they are I wonder how they firgure out those charts
I have no idea but im my books I like Flo Rida song the most
Yes I understand and I love DJ Snake and Justin Bieber song over Flo Rida's song.
We both have a great eye for pop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop singer?
I really like Ed Sheeran, but the radio plays some of his songs too much.
That's for sure.  Every time I turn on the radio, they are playing Shape of You.
Exactly!  Now they have started on Castle on the Hill.
His music is great though.
I really wanted to go to his concert last year, but I couldn't.
When was it?
It was in Tulsa the day before Mother's Day.
Bummer.  That would have been a great concert.
Maybe we can get tickets to his show in Dallas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Carole King.
She's really an oldie.
Yes, ever since the 60s, with her husband Gerry Coffin.
What did she write then?
She wrote Up on the Roof.
Wow, I did not know that.
She also wrote One Fine Day.
Amazing.  Anything else?
You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman.
I thought Aretha Franklin wrote that. I am shocked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the song, 'Bad Things' by Machine Gun Kelly?
Yes, I've heard it.  It's quite catchy.
I agree.  It's been stuck in my head all month.
Did you know the chorus was actually sampled?
I had no clue.  What was the original song?
The original song was was 'Out of My Head,' by Fastball.
I don't know who that is.
They were a popular band during the nineties.  I'm a huge fan still.
What are some other songs by them that you would recommend?
I would listen to 'The Way' and 'You're an Ocean.'
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lorde?
I've only heard her singles, but they're okay.
I think she's really talented for someone so young.
Oh, I didn't know. How old is she?
She's 20 now, but I think she was 17 when she made her first album.
Oh wow, that is really young. I didn't know. That's impressive.
I think she'll be around for a really long time.
I saw she's releasing her 3rd album already.
Yes, this year. She's already so creative for someone so young.
I'll have to keep an eye out for more stuff from her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Taylor Swift?
While I'm not a fan of the drama that surrounds her, I have to admit that I love her sound.
I like her music too.  It's just so catchy.
Exactly.  I think she has really great producers and writers, and she is a tremendous performer.
What was your favorite album by her?
'1989' had so many fun songs.  'Shake it Off' and 'Bad Blood' were so good.
Not only were they good pop songs, but their music videos were great too.
Yup.  Combined, they have over 3 billion views on YouTube.
That is so many views.  I wonder when her next album will come out.
Me too, though in a Rolling Stone interview last year, even Taylor said she has no idea what's next for her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever seen Elton John live?
No,that's one pop singer I really want to see.
I saw him once.
Nice,did he play all his hits.
Probably impossible to play them all.
He's got a ton.
He did play,Goodbye Yellowbrick Road,Daniel,Candle In The Wind.
I love candle in the wind.
Yea,it's about Princess Diane.
I know,it's so sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like Taylor Swift?
she's great. I like her music very much
for example?
well she has 2 different stages of style, when she was younger she was a country style music girl, now she's a pop star. I like both Fearless and 1989
Are there any specific songs you like to mention?
overall, I feel those 2 albums' songs are all great, I couldn listen to them all day, like Clean, Fearless, etc.
how come you get to know Taylor Swift?
It was from her ultra popular music video "You Belong With Me".
Oh that one, It struck me that those 2 girls in the video were both Taylor Swift
haha, I was totally surprised too, I wouldn't know if I didn't pay too much attention
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pop music is so untalented
Huh
Like i said pop music is untalented
I would not agree with that
Why not
Because they have to learn to sing and stuff
but they do none of the hard work
How is their work not hard?
Because they do not write the actual music
Well still
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some popular pop artists?
Right now? I don't keep up but someone like Taylor Swift or Justin Beiber.
I used to like Britney Spears. That's pop.
I enjoy older pop like 80's or 90's.
Did you like Prince?
Yes, he was one of my favorites. Such a shame.
I loved George Michael, shame about him also.
Yes, he was very handsome.
I think I need to google modern pop.
These millenials all sound they same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you thin of Ed Sheeran?
I think he's great.
My favorite is Galway Girl.
That ones good, but I like his version of Wayfaring Stranger that he has on YouTube.
I don't think I've seen that yet.
You have to check it out, he does it with just a microphone and a repeater.
Whoa really, that sounds awesome.
It is, it shows how good he actually is.
I just bought Shape of you off of iTunes.
Well hit play and turn it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest pop singer of all time?
You mean, besides Michael Jackson, the King of Pop?
Besides Michael Jackson. And besides Madonna. Who would you say?
I'd have to say Elvis Presley then.
You're probably right. I would put Prince and George Michael on that short list also.
Oh, I totally agree! Prince is more R&B, though.
Maybe. But George Michael is right up there and totally pop.
It's so sad that almost all of that list is dead now.
I can't believe it, either.
Their incredible music lives on, at least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose is your least favorite artist
I cannot say
Why not
Well i have ones in different genres
Okay what about one specific genre
Okay how about pop music
Well then yeah i got one
Who is it
I cannot stand miley cyrus
She is sorta meh
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what's your favorite pop band?
My favorite pop artist probably is Tove Lo.
Oh yeah, isnt she from Norway?
No she's from Sweden!
I thought she was from Norway, maybe you are right.
Her English is pretty good - its hard to tell its not her native language when she's singing.
Yeah that's true, I dont think I would have known had I not read about it online.
My favorite song of hers recently is My Gun.
Oh that's her? I heard that on the radio the other day.
Yeah, I heard she records a lot of her music on her phone when she's on tour and so that's how she's so prolific.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like pop music
Yes i love pop music
Megan trainor is one of my favorites
She is amazing
I love her music
Shes a great entertainer
Yes she is
Well good talking to you
You too
Bye
XXXXXXXXXXX
I dont think I can stand another summer of pop hits.
Whats wrong, dont like sick beats?
Are you serious right now?
Not really, most pop music hurts my ears too.
The weird south american club influences and cholo beats are just too much.
Sia puts out some decent stuff though.
Yeah but good tracks are few and far between these days.
I understand, its hard to stay sane through most of what I hear on the radio.
We need a cleanse.
I'd prefer some earplugs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like ed sheeran
Yes he sounds amazing
I know what you mean
His song is my ringtone
Which song
Shape of you
Thats a good one
Is so catchy
It is im singing it right now
Got it stuck in your head
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Hanson's new song yet?
No I haven't what is it called?
I was Born, its one of their best songs ever!
Thanks! I'll have to look for it on Spotifiy.
The music video is even better, they have their kids in it.
Shutup! That's amazing, I can't believe they have kids- they are my favorite band of all time.
I know! They are just as cute as ever....who's your favorite?
Zac, he was in 1996 and he still is today.
Did you start with Middle of Nowhere?
Yes, best cd and I still stream it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
Yeah I like Icona Pop.
Oh they arent that popular.
I disagree. They have only had a few hit songs though.
What song do you like by them?
I like the song Girls Girls.
Oh do you recommend it?
Totally.
That is cool. I will take a listen.
You will definitely love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like girl bands in pop music?
Sure. Its awesome when women artists are represented that way in music.
Yeah its really great. Wish there were more.
So who do you like?
Go Gos, Bangles, and Pussy Riot.
Pussy Riot, okay. I'm not familiar with them.
Sure, they're not mainstream in the US.
Go Gos, they're really solid.
Some good musicians there.
Bangles are fun to listen to, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You listening to pop music lately.
A little bit, some Imagine Dragons.
Oh yea, have you heard the new CArrie Underwood song
Nope, any good?
I like it.  But I like Country crossover
Have you heard Gaga's newest
No, I've outgrown her stuff.   But it was fun for a while.
I know what you mean, her and Miley!
Ever hear Darius Rucker?
Oh yeah, interesting dude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The term pop music covers so many kinds of music in my opinion.
Oh yeah, why do you think that?
I mean it covers things that some would consider R&B to things that people would consider borderline country.
I think that is why I like it, it is very diverse even within one genre.
My favorite singer is Taylor Swift though.
She is good. She has country roots, but flirts with an R&B sound sometimes.
She is kind of the epitome of pop music then.
She is very talented, that is for sure.
I really like some of the new songs Miley Cyrus is putting out.
Another pop artist with some country in her background.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Janet Jackson was as good as her brother?
Yes. She had so many good pop songs.
She did. I remember my friend dancing every time she came on.
Which song?
Nasty.
That's funny. All girls loved that song.
Her album Control had a few hits.
What Have You Done For Me Lately was on that, right?
Yes. My friend had the cassette.
That's old. A cassette.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you think Gwen Stefani makes pop music?
Nowadays she does.
But she didnt always?
When she was in No Doubt, she did not.
What genre would you consider that?
I guess rock.
So she broke away from them?
Yeah she still performs songs like Dont Speak.
But no longer tours with them?
No, plus shes on that NBC show for singers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you say is the best pop song of 2017?
That's a tough question.  Especially because there have been so many memorable and catchy ones thus far.
If you had to pick just one though?
I think the title has to go to 'Shape of You' by Ed Sheeran.  Right from when it came out in January, it's been dominating the charts.
What do you like about it the most?
I love the dancehall element of it, and the fact that despite his ability to reach high notes, Sheeran keeps his voice lower for it.
That did definitely add to the impact of his song and lyrics.
Also, the song didn't just do well here.  It hit number one on the charts of 30 other countries.
That's impressive.  I feel like I still hear that song all the time.
That makes sense, since it's the second most streamed song on Spotify still.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any songs in the charts you like right?
On the pop charts? Not really.
You don't like the Selena Gomez track?
I haven't heard it. What's it like?
Well it's totally unlike her.
How so? I liked her last album.
Well she samples the Talking Heads.
That's not something I would have ever expected from her.
You've gotta hear it. She's really doing some cool stuff right now.
I will. Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite type of music?
I love Top 40 or Pop music.
How come?
Pop music represents many things to me.
Like what?
First, it's trendy. I like to know what's popular right now. I like to feel in touch with the youth of today.
What else?
Another reason is that Pop music was once Underground music.
What do you mean?
Pop music culture borrow heaviliy from the styles that are currently popular in the clubs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of It Ain't Me by Kygo?
The music video doesn't match the lyrics.
I haven't seen it. Why don't they fit?
It's about her NOT caring for the guy when he makes stupid mistakes.
Okay, and?
The video is him in a motorcycle accident.
That makes no sense.
Agreed.
I just looked it up and apparently it came out in 2006?
But it's in current top 40? Weird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you been listening to any new pop music lately?
I have been listening to 'Stay' by Zedd and Alessia Cara! What about you?
That song is awesome! I have been listening to 'It Ain't Me' all day!
Is that the song by Selena Gomez?
Yes! It is the perfect summer pop song.
I would have to disagree! The new song by Chainsmokers is amazing.
They have a new one? Which one is that?
It's called 'Something Just Like This' and it's with Coldplay.
I don't think I've heard it yet.  I'll have to check it out.
You need to! It's the best collaboration I've heard in awhile.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever heard of Kimbra? She's a pop artist from New Zealand, I think.
Oh, yeah! I love her!
Me too! Both her first and second albums are so good.
I agree, but I prefer The Golden Echo.
Yeah, she did a lot of growing up on that album.
True. Her songs are much more mature with a lot of deep lyrics.
Except for 90's Music. That one was just really fun.
Actually, I really found it to be about her growing up. The lyrics are about how she's grown up but she still misses and loves that time.
And she's clearly talking about some old lover she had.
That is such a great album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Katy Perry's new hairstyle?
Yes! She looks so different from when she first started her career.
I know. It doesn't even look like her.
I will always remember Katy Perry for how she looked in her California Gurls music video.
Oh yeah. She was so pretty in that video and that song is so catchy.
My favorite song by her is probably Firework.
Firework is really catchy, too. I like some of her lesser known songs like Pearl and Circle the Drain.
Sometimes it seems like the best songs that artists have are the less popular ones.
I agree. Kesha has such a beautiful voice, but I don't like any of her songs that always play on the radio.
I haven't listened to Kesha much. I'll have to check out some of her songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Disney Channel helped to produce some really good pop music.
You mean like songs from Hannah Montana?
That's one example.There's also The Jonas Brothers.
I love the song Kid's From the Future.
I do, too.
A song I love was done by Mitchell Musso and was called Shout It.
That was good and I wish he had recorded more songs.
Let's not forget all of the great pop songs from the High School Musical series.
Like Breaking Free?
That and /Fabulous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Katy Perry and Migos track?
I didn't know they collaborated.
Yes they made a fun song.
Ok I want to hear that.
Migos does a great job of singing fun lyrics.
How does Katy sound.
She matched with him well, her lyrics are super upbeat and exciting.
Ok that sounds like a good song for going out at night.
Yes it is perfect for that.
Ok thanks for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite pop radio station?
I like Kiss FM. They play all the hits from today's pop music.
What's the most played artist on their station?
They play a lot of Bruno Mars, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber...
Have you heard Justin Bieber's new featured song Despacito?
Yes! I have. It's great. I can't believe there's a song in Spanish on the radio and it's a hit.
Do you understand any of the lyrics?
No, I don't speak Spanish... but I've listened to Daddy Yankee before.
Daddy Yankee? Didn't he sing that song called Gasolina?
Yeah that's a popular reggaeton song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Carly Rae Jepsen might be my favorite pop artist going right now.
Yeah it's really hard to argue with the greatness of Emotion.
Yeah I feel like a lot of people wrote her off after Call Me Maybe.
Which was a definite mistake, Emotion is a pop classic.
Her new single is sounding good too.
Agreed, do you know who is producing?
I'm not sure, I know I saw Jack Antonoff's name thrown around a bit.
I don't think it's him, but I know he worked with her in the past.
So did Butch Walker so she is on a roll with collaborations.
Can't wait for her new album in full followed by a tour.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What ever happened to Britney Spears?
She's still around.
I haven't heard a new song from her in a long time.
I think she has a show in Las Vegas now.
She was the Queen of pop music for a while.
It seemed after she broke up with Justin Timberlake she didn't handle that well.
She had a couple of hit songs but nothing like she was in the late 90s.
It's got to be tough to be that famous at 18.
Justin Bieber was more famous at a younger age.
Yeah, well look how well he's handling it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was really surprised to see how great Ariane Grande is.
I did not even know she could sing so well.
I loved her new one.
Side to Side?
Yes, it was a really great summer jam.
She is actually a really skilled vocalist.
I heard that in her song, Beauty and The Beast.
It is nice to see a pop star with such a vocal range for once.
She is far better than most of the tv stars turned pop stars.
I think Brittney Spears did well, after the Mouse club.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's been so much great music lately. What's your favorite summer hit?
I'm really into Liam Payne's Strip That Down.
Didn't he used to be in One Direction?
Yeah, he was! He's taking time to expand his solo career.
That's great, I'll have to give that a listen. Have you listened to any of Harry Style's new album?
I have. I've been listening to it on repeat for weeks!
Same, what's your favorite song?
Probably Two Ghosts, it's so emotionally charged and lyrically beautiful.
I love that one too. Sign of the Times is my favorite.
I love that one too! The members of One Direction are all releasing some great solo music!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm listening to Justin Timberlake!
He is a great artist.
I like his song Sexy Back.
That's his best one!
I also like his old stuff when he was with Backstreet Boys!
Yeah but I like him better now.
Have you seen his music video for Cry Me A River?
Yeah! He had a Britney lookalike!
That song was totally about her.
The video was too. I love that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you an Nsync or Backstreet Boys fan?
I was an Nsync fan.
Really, you weren't in to Backstreet Boys.
I liked their songs.
Why did you like Nsync?
Easy, I thought Justin Timberlake was hot.
You thought he was hotter than the all the Backstreet Boys.
Yeah I did.
What about their music?
I loved all of their music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is Paula Abdul?
She is a pop artist
I thought she was a judge on American Idol
She is, but she once has a solo career
What is a song she made?
Forever Your Girl
Is that a great song?
It is amazing. Every verse is cool.
I'll have to buy a CD of hers
She is a great pop artist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Justin Beiber is very popular right now I was wondering why is that?
He is super talented on and off the stage.
What is the name of his latest song?
I think its "Despacito".
Who is featured on this song with Justin Beiber?
I believe its Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee.
What kind of song is this?
Its a very upbeat song and I'm sure you will like it. The song has a reggaton feel to it which is a nice touch.
Who wrote "Despacito"?
It was Erika Ender.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Janet Jackson was very big back in the day.
Well it didnt hurt she was born into music royalty.
So you think she rode the coat tails of her family?
Yes I think she got a boost with them
Rhythm Nation was a massive hit
Its what really started her career
And then the Super Bowl incident
Thats what gave her life in the 2000s.
I think she is still making music
Maybe but who would know?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Ariana Grande!
What is your favorite Ariana Grande song?
I really like "Break Free"
Is that the song that she did with Zedd?
It is! I like Zedd a lot too.
Did you know that Ariana got her start on a TV show?
I sure did! I first heard of her from television.
How old is she?
I think she is only 23 years old.
She is so young and has already had so much success. That is impressive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is so weird
What is weird
That pop music is called pop
Why is it weird
I know it means popular but
But what
Pop is also the name of a sound and it does not sounds like that
Well yeah popping balloons is scary
Not the type of music i would like
Precisely why it lacks that sound
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Sign of the Times?
The One Direction song?
No, it's Harry Styles on his solo career.
Oh, right. Umm, it's kind of whiney
How so?
It ... sounds like he's whining constantly
Maybe it's about feeling bad about the current state of things.
Politcally?
No, not everything is political. Emotional, life.
Oh, well, I still don't like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have loved pop music since I was pretty young.
I have to! Who was your favorite growing up?
I loved listening to Britney Spears music when I was 11.
I really liked her original music back in those days.
Yes me too!
She was pure and wholesome back then.
I'm not as big of a fan of her music now.
I'm not either. Did you like 98 degrees?
Wasn't that a pop boy band back in the late 90's?
Yes it was and they were great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like THAT'S WHAT I LIKE?
Yes, Bruno is the best.
Wake up with not pajamas.
Let's jump in the Cadillac.
And put some miles on it.
I'm going to give it to you.
Silk sheets and diamonds, all right.
That's what I like.
Trips to Puerto Rico.
Anything you want.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I was surprised by how much I like Harry Style's new music.
Same! Especially since I haven't been all that impressed by the other ones from One Direction.
Right? Like, I'll hear their stuff and I don't hate it, but I didn't go look it up to hear it again.
I never thought he release an album like that.
Me neither, I'm pleasantly surprised. It's got a very Paul McCartney-esque sound to it.
Yes! And some David Bowie too. You can really hear the British influence to it, not just pop.
Good point. I think I'm going to listen to the whole album, I've only listened to a couple of the songs.
You should, it's really good.
Did you see the video for Sign of the Times though?
It's weird, I know. I couldn't even watch the whole thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In your opinion, who is the best female pop singer right now?
I would have to go with either Beyonce or Taylor Swift.
Really, Taylor Swift?
Yes, why not Taylor Swift?
She is good, don't get me wrong, I just think there are so many better.
Well do you at least agree with Beyonce?
Oh definitely, who wouldn't?
It would be hard to argue.
Taylor Swift is good as well. She has had many hits recently.
Right, which is why I put her on the level of Beyonce.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who's your favourite pop singer nowadays?
I would say Bruno Mars
Me too! I love him!
Whats your favorite song?
I like "Thats what I like"
I like 24 carat gold!
Yeah, his new stuff is so awesome. Better than his old music
Yeah, grenade was just a sad song in my opinion
I wonder where he gets his ideas from
Recently he's been doing some stuff like Michael Jackson's music
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's your faovirte artist in pop music?
oh it's gotta have to be katy perry
why is that?
oh, she's amazing alright, do you know she's the first one to have 100 million followers on Twitter?
really? that's a lot of followers
yes indeed, and there is a reason for that. Because she's an excellent pop singer and a kind human being
I heard of her music before, she was at last year's superbowl opening
she always got some very unique costume and stage designs, last year's superbowl opening wasn't an exception
do you remeber the left shark?
haha, yea, he got his own move.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What bands do you like?
Hmm, I'm listening to Fun a lot right now.
They did Some Nights, right?
Correct. Very catchy song.
Yeah! I thought TG Lurgan did an awesome cover of it in Irish.
TG Lurgan?
Yeah, they cover a lot of popular songs in Irish. It's really cool, sounds very professional and is a great way to get people interested in the language.
Well, you learn something new every day! I didn't even know that was a thing.
See? Just by mentioning them you're learning more about Irish stuff.
TG Lurgan huh? I'll check them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like Avril Lavigne?
I really like her, listening to her album I can almost feel her progression in life as a human being.
I feel the same, she's such a great singer, and she creates those music with her souls
I think that's the magic that makes her songs attactive, isn't it?
I can't agree more, I listen to her albums from Let Go to Goodbye Lullaby
oh, you know her song from Goodbye Lullaby was featured as the main theme music of Alice in Wonderland?
yeah, I recognized her voice immediately after I hearing the music
it's great, isn't it? But it's also kinda, I don't know sad? to see her away from her street punk style music
yea, she's married and definitely more mature now, but I do miss her old style, simply cool and careless, the feeling of letting go
i agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Michael Jackson is the king of pop?
Yes, he's sold more records than almost anyone.
He did have some great songs.
His album thriller is an all time great.
Is that the one with Billie Jean?
Yeah that was on there.
Billie Jean is one of my favorite songs.
It's a great song.
I wish he didn't go crazy towards the end of his life.
It did diminish his greatness.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I listened to the new Starley song and really liked it, did you hear it yet?
I'm not sure, which one?
It is called Call on me.
What kind of song is it?
It is calming yet happy and energizing a bit.
Interesting, is it a happy song?
Well there are some sad words but it is mostly positive.
That sounds like life itself.
Yes the song does mirror life like that.
I will listen to it soon, thanks for mentioning it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have been listening to the top 40 playlist on Spotify; it's great!
Really? What are some of your favorite songs on it?
I am loving that song Despascito with Justin Beiber!
Me too.  It is so catchy.
I also really like that song I'm the One.
Same! I could listen to it on repeat all day.
I don't usually like DJ Kahled but I do think that song is so catchy.
It is definitely a major key.
Haha! I saw Chance the Rapper do some of it live.
That must have been awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are you listening to in regards to pop music?
Bruno Mars has been getting a lot of hits in my playlist
Oh, I loved Uptown funk
Yeah it had a real nice beat!
I loved how retro it sounded, his new direction is really great
You should listen to That's What I Like
What does it sound like
It has a 70s vibe to it
Cool, I prefer some of the old fashioned stuff
Me too, it's some of his best work
XXXXXXXXXXX
What pop song have you been loving and would recommend?
Noah Cyrus Feat. Labrinth 'Make Me Cry' .
I thought that it was miley the first time I heard it.
Well they are sisters bound to sound a little alike.
I am actually surprised how much I enjoy her songs.
She doesn't have the same fame as miley but I would argue as talented.
Agreed , from what I have heard thus far.
Ya we may have an ashley simpson. Until I hear her live not 100% sure on her talent.
Hahaha, I forgot about that SNL performance disaster.
Ya It destroyed her having a career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Taylor Swift and her music is so popular!
That's true. I like her music.
Some of her videos are funny too.
Like which one?
Shake it Off. I laughed pretty much the entire time.
That song has a catchy tune.
At a party I was at, the DJ played that song.
Did a lot of people dance?
Some got up and performed the dance routine from the video.
That's crazy! Sounds you had a nice time though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to pop music?
Sometimes. I really like Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran, you?
I love Katy Perry. And, that new song, Despacito.
I like it too but is it really pop? It's in Spanish.
It's pretty popular, so I think it's pop. What other pop songs do you likes?
I really like Believer, by Imagine Dragons. What about you?
I think my new favorite pop song is Issues.
Is that by Arianna Grande?
No, it's by Julia Michaels.
Oh, I though it was Arianna Grande.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Chainsmokers?
Not really. I do not think they are very talented.
But they have so many hits!
I think the artists that sing on their songs are more talented than the Chainsmokers are.
Who sings on their songs?
Many people! Halsey is the vocalist on the song "Closer"
Didn't Halsey just release a new album?
She did!
What is it called?
The new album is called Hopeless Fountain Kingdom
XXXXXXXXXXX
okay so who is your favorite pop artist?
It's taylor swift.
Oh, wow! She is my favorite artist as well.
I just love her so much.
Yes, almost all of her songs have been awesome.
So which one is your favorite song?
it's blank space.
Wow! what a co incidence, that is my favorite song as well.
Have you seen music video of it?
Oh yes, it is awesome as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's one pop song you can listen to on repeat over and over?
Yes, I know what repeat means, thanks. Have you heard of Deep Blue Something?
Nope. What's that?
It's a 90's band who just recently reunited.
What was their biggest hit?
Their only hit you'll recognize: Breakfast at Tiffany's?
Right! They're a one-hit-wonder then?
Yeah, which stinks for them as they've put out a lot of albums.
Why did you listen to it a lot?
My prom date and I had it as our favorite song. We listened to it constantly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite pop artist?
I liked Michael Jackson.
It's too bad he's gone now.
Yeah, that's sad.
He was such an incredible artist.
I know.  I miss seeing him.
There won't be another like him.
That's true.  He was so influential.
What was your favorite song by him?
Absolutely positively thriller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter is a Demi Lovato fan.
Wasn't she on a kids' show?
Yes, she was on Barney.
Cool.  What's one of her big hits?
This is Me.
Right.  What album was it in?
Don't Forget.
What was her second album?
Here We Go Again
I hope she is over her personal troubles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite pop artist of all time?
That's easy. It's Michael Jackson.
He is the king. I can't argue with that.
He just sang in an effortless way. It was like he didn't even have to try to be great.
I agree. He could have done vocals over anything and it would have been good.
He actually used to write his own songs, too.
That's so cool. That's really rare in pop music.
What was your favorite song by him?
Mine was probably "Smooth Criminal". What was yours?
I'm going to have to go with "Beat it".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite N'Sync member?
Justin Timberlake
I like him too.
I love him in N'Sync
Do you like his solo stuff too?
Yes, I think it is fantastic
Do you like Britney Spears as well?
Yes, I do
Her and Justin were the best in the 90's
Yeah, they had some great hits
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite current pop song?
Bruno Mars That's What I Like. Such a good beat.
I enjoy the beat but those lyrics...
What is wrong with the lyrics, I love them!
I feel like they are just one cliche after another.
I don't think so. I think it is a fun song and he really probably likes all those things.
He very well may, but who doesn't?
I am not sure most guys enjoy strawberry champagne.
Maybe have me there, but just feel this songs lyrics are too generic for me to appreciate.
Fair enough. But I find them super catchy and fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's funny?
What?
I really try not to like Justin Bieber's music and I actually like a lot of it. I wish he didn't sing pop music so I wouldn't hear it on the radio all the time.
I understand how a lot of people are turned off by his personality.
That's exactly my problem, but I like a lot of his music.
I thought he was done being popular but then he came back in 2015 and released that song Sorry and I knew that was going to be a big hit.
I have to admit, I do like the album Sorry is on. That one is named Purpose right?
Yes, that album is Purpose and it also has What Do You Mean and Love Yourself on there as well.
Is that his fourth album?
Yes, plus he's done a ton of collaborations with other artists on their records, like DJ Snake and too many others to name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you a fan of pop music?
I understand the appeal, but I don't really like it.
Are you a music snob?
Not at all, pop music just sounds the same to me.
It is popular though, so go with what works right?
I guess, but you just don't see much creativity any more.
Is there any new pop that you do like?
I do like that new "Sound of the Times" song.
And why is that?
It has complexity and actually feels like a throwback song to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
got a favorite gaga album?
it has to be born this way
it had so many bangers!
yeah, like born this way and marry the night.
a lot of catchy tunes.
i like cheek to cheek too?
that collaboration?
sure, they match each other well.
i'm not a huge fan of tony to be honest.
really? you should be
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Ed Sheeran's new album, Divide?
I have! I think that this is his best album yet!
Which song is your favorite out of them all?
I really like Shape Of You. Which is your favorite?
My favorite is probably Galway Girl. I do like them all very much, though.
Me too. Are you ready for Taylor Swift's next album to come out?
Yes! I have heard it is going to be just as good as 1989.
That is what I have heard too! It will be hard for her to top Wildest Dreams though.
I agree! She is such a good artist!
I know. Her and Ed Sheeran are my favorite pop artists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you see Lady Gaga doing more than she already has?
In what terms?
Like her Super Bowl performance was probably her best ever, right?
Sure it was great but she can do more.
And then she did a duo with Tony Bennet!
She is showing her diversity.
I think she is such a great entertainer.
I believe she is this generation's Madonna
Except shes not outspoken.
No but she takes hardline stances on many things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really miss the TV show Chuck.
I liked that show. What do you miss the most?
The music by Jeffster.
They were so funny!
I loved the episode when they sang Push It.
That was a crack up.
I also like when they did Mr. Roboto.
My favorite was in the series finale of Chuck when they performed Take on Me.
That was really suspenseful.
It was,and I'm glad the song worked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big fan of Justin Bieber?
Not really.  Why?
I don't really care for him either.  I heard he messed up on some of his own lyrics.
Oh, yeah.  I heard that too.
What was the name of the song?
I think it was like Despacito or something like that.  Why?
I wanted to see if there's a video online.
Yeah, I've seen it before.
Does he look good in it?
Honestly, he looks drunk.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about pop music
Okay that sounds great
awesome
I really like the chainsmokers new song
The one with halsey?
Yea closer
Thats a good song
I just heard it on the radio
It comes on all the time
I like it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Harry Styles new song?
No, how is it?
I just don't like it.
Really?
Yeah, his voice is good but the song is not.  Just not for me, I guess.
Have you heard Liam Payne's new song?
Yes, it is bad too.
I know, they were much better as a group than individuals.
I agree
Liam's song is so recycled ideas, it is not original at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Are you a fan of Ed Sheeran?
Yeah, I love him! I have all of his albums.
Great! I actually have tickets to see him next Saturday if you want to come with me.
That would be amazing, I would love to come! Do you know who's opening for him?
I know James Blunt is playing too, but I don't know if he's opening. I'd assume so.
I've never heard of him.
He's an English singer-songwriter. He's pretty similar to Ed Sheeran, I would say.
Do you think I would like him?
IF you like Ed Sheeran, then definitely.
Awesome! I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long have you listened to pop music?
Since I can remember......i am 46 years old now
Is the poo music different now?
Yes, back then pop music was more versatile  as compared to now in my opinion
Do you buy pop music?
I do, I buy a lot of it on itunes
Do you think pop music is whitewashed?
Yes I do, there used to be songs and artists like Blondie. But that element of character seems to be no more
What pop artists would you go see in concert?
I would go see Mariah, and Beyonce as well as Taylor swift
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about Coldplay?
I love them! Their new album is amazing!
Really!? Me too!
What's your favorite song from them?
Right now, A Sky Full of Stars is mine, Can't get that out of my head. How about you?
Well, I love their older songs, like Fix You and Yellow
Isn't it cool how they can incorporate so many different genre in their albums?
Right!? They're so talented!
Have you bought tickets to their world tour?
Of course I did!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to American top 40
Is that the radio show with Ryan seacrest
Yes that's the one
Yeah I listen to it on the way home
I really like Halsey
What's her song
Now or never is one of them
Yeah they play that a lot on the radio
I prefer her single gasoline
Let's download it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am a huge Adele fan. How about you?
I absolutely love her.
Her voice is incredible.
I know. And she is so young.
Yes she is,25.
Right,just like the album.
Great songs off that album.
I love,Hello and Water Under The Bridge.
They are great tunes.
Love In The Dark is good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like for music?
I like pop
Oh okay me too
Who do you like?
I like Ed Sheeran
Hes good, i love his songs
Who do you like?
I like the chainsmokers and taylor swift
I like the chainsmokers too, not so much taylor swift
Oh ok
XXXXXXXXXXX
MMMMM bop!
Don't sing that again.
Don't like Hansen?
I have mixed feelings about them. They're talented but that song's annoying
You know they were all 21 and under when they wrote it, right?
Yeah, and?
Their music is really good now.
Aren't they all old and married now?
Not old, but old enough that they have to sing Mmmbop down a fourth to compensate for their voices.
Ha, I'd love to hear them sing it back in the original key.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the latest from Lady Gaga?
Not yet, I was going to give it a listen on Spotify just now.
I think it's one of the best things she's done yet.
What's so good about it.
It's got great rhythm and the lyrics are really amazing.
Cool. Do you think the rest of the album will be that good?
It's Lady Gaga, what do you think?
Okay, I'll take your word for it. Huh, this is good.
See? When have I ever lied to you?
Well, there was that time you tried to convince me you were Michael Jackson's illegitimate son...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to old pop music from when you were growing up?
I sure do. Stuff I didn't really like at the time is enjoyable now because of the nostalgia.
Who are some of the artists that you listen to now that you never would have before.
That would probably include NSync and the Backstreet Boys.
I know the girls sure go wild for those songs when they hear them come on at a bar.
It takes them back to when they were teenagers.
Do you still listen to pop music today?
There are some pop artists that I like. I think Adele is really good.
She is an amazing singer.
There aren't too many artists like that anymore. She is a throwback to artists that were popular just because of their talent level.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga seems to have declined in recent years with her hits.
She definitely hasn't been churning out hits like she used to.
She's still on the scene, I suppose. She did the super bowl halftime show last year.
Was surprising there wasn't a controversy surrounding her during that show.
For sure. She sometimes does things to get attention.
Her music videos sure screamed attention and look at me.
She's definitely a great artist. A little bit out of left field some times.
For sure. She was always compared to Madonna, who also did some racy things as well.
Some say she doesn't sound like Madonna at all. But I see the music and antic comparisons clearly.
Very true. Madonna was ahead of her times. Lady Gaga seems to fit in with the society today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't keep up with pop music is much as I used to, but there are few artists I like.
Same. Justin Bieber's pretty great.
I don't listen to him much, but I do like Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato.
Selena Gomez is great! I love her new single "Bad Liar".
Yeah, that's a good song. I'm liking Miley Cyrus's new stuff, too.
I actually saw her on one of those late night shows the other night. She sang beautifully.
She's very talented. I watched her at the Manchester benefit concert.
I heard she did a cover with Ariana Grande.
She did! They performed "Don't Dream It's Over" by Crowded House.
Nice. I'll have to look that one up on YouTube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to any pop music regularly?
Yeah I listen to meghan trainor some times.
Oh really? That is cool.
I like the song No.
That sound makes me laugh for some reason.
What song do you like by her best?
I like the song All about that bass.
That song is a good one.
Have you seen the video?
No not yet actually.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
Some artist I do.  I am a fan of Ed Sheeren and others
Is that really pop music?
Hell, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
I also like Meghan Trainer, Lady gaga, and Rihanna.
I like them as well.
Meaghan Trainers whole album was awesome.
I downloaded it a few months ago.  Every song sounds good.
That girl can really sing.
You can say that again.  She doesn't need all that auto tune bullshit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think has the best voice in pop music?
That's a toss up. Either Christina Aguilera or Mariah Carey.
Those are both really strong choices.
Definitely. They both have a massive range.
Mariah can hit some insane notes. I think Christina has more style, though.
Yeah, in Mariah's song "Emotions" she hits some ear piercing notes.
That song is really old but great.
I agree. It's probably in her top 3 best songs.
What's your favorite song from Christina?
I always liked "Beautiful". It had a really powerful message.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Katy Perry?
I am not a fan of female vocals.
Oh OK, me neither but she does transcend pop
There are a few I can tolerate
what is your favorite from her?
Last friday night is the best I think
I dont feel that
What is yours?
Califonira Girls was my top hit
I loved the video for that song
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any of Miley Cyrus's music?
It's really hit or miss for me.
I think she has a great voice.
She does have a really strong voice. Some of her songs annoy me, though.
Which ones didn't you like?
It was really only "Wrecking Ball". I really dislike that song.
That's not my favorite, either. Which one is your favorite?
I always loved "Party in the USA". I thought it was so catchy.
Have you heard her new song "Malibu"?
I haven't but I saw she made a video for it. I will give it a listen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Katy Perry?
I like most of her music, but especially her song "Dark Horse".
Thats a great song. What do you think about her feud with Taylor Swift?
I can't believe it has gotten so out of hand. Its really time to squash it already.
You know when Taylor Swift came out with "Bad Blood" I knew it was going to be an ongoing feud for a good while.
"Bad Blood" was so obviously about Katy, but Katy has had a bit more couth with her retaliation.
I wish they would go back to being good friends, put this stupidity behind them, and move forward as an unstoppable girl power house.
A Katy Perry and Taylor Swift collab would be a great way to put it all to rest. It had been hinted at, but has never come to fruition.
Hopefully this year we will see the feud end and with that get an amazing pop song from two of the hottest female pop stars of this decade.
I agree. Fans are ready, the world is ready, its time for the ultimate pop collab!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
I loke those Now that's what I call music CDs.
Tgose have a lot of pop songs.
They sure do.
I like older stuff like Ace of Base.
I Saw the Sogn was so popular.
What pop songs do you loke?
I like Justin Bieber and What Do You Mean.
Do you like One Direction?
Yes, Harry Styles is so cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which pop music band is your favorite?
I think it has to be the Beatles.
Oh right on!  I like them a lot.
They were so popular in their time. There's been no other band like them.
They're in their own category it seems.
And they wrote so many classics.  I enjoy their songs so much.
Classic is a good word.
Also their music still feels fresh today.
Its really clever stuff.
Too bad some of them are gone now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you ever a fan of Madonna?
I actually liked her music back in high school and had one of her CDs.
Which was your favorite song of hers?
"Material Girl" was one of my faves.
Oh yes I remember that one.
I listened to her music periodically.
Remember when ACE of Base was popular?
I'm not sure I remember them, name one of their songs.
One was "The Sign", I loved that one.
I think I remember it being sung on Full House!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like pop music at all?
Not one of my favorite genres, but it can be okay at times.
Fair assessment I've fallen in love with old 80's pop music in particular.
Oh really? What artists would you recommend?
Michael Jackson would be first, so many classics.
I will admit I've not given him enough of a chance, I do really like Man in The Mirror though.
That would be my absolute favorite track of his, but also check out Billy Jean, Thriller and Smooth Criminal.
Wasn't there a newer band that covered smooth criminal?
You're thinking of Alien Ant Farm. Alot of people like the cover, didn't do much for me.
Yeah me neither, Jackson is a hard act to follow, I can even say that given my limited exposure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like michael jackson
of course i do
right? who doesnt
thriller is one of the best albums ever
he is the king of pop
he really is
i love dirty diana
man in the mirror is my favorite
that song is so inspiring
michael jackson was the truth
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of pop music?
I don't really listen to it because every song is about love and I hate love.
There has to be some people you like.
I do really like Ed Sheeran because is songs are great.
What songs do you like?
I like "That's what I like" a lot.
So I see you listen to some pop music.
Yes I do listen to some of it just not on a regular basis.
There are lots of great songs to be discovered.
I think I will get more into it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Natalie Imbruglia's Torn?
I"m all out of faith, this is how I feel..
Looks like you do.
Do you know she's not the original singer of it?
Really?
Yeah, it's a cover of a song that came out a half decade earlier.
Wow, I had no idea.
Yeah, that version is more rock-forward
Which is better?
Natalie's for sure. But then again, Australian pop wasn't a thing until the mid-90's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Lady Gagas halftime show at the Super Bowl?
It was great I really like Lady Gaga.
I do as well I was really happy she played all of her top hits.
I know it was awesome she didnt leave any hits out.
I also really liked how there were no guest performances and it was just her.
I actually would have liked to see some guest performances because those are my favorite.
Do you have a favorite song from Lady Gaga?
I do my favorite is Bad Romance
I dont think I can pick a favorite I like them all.
I understand that, hopefully she will return to perform again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about music, who is your favorite pop artist?
Ed sheeran has been dominating a lot of my listening more recently.
I really liked the shape of you his more recent hit.
One of my favorites, in fact the whole of Sheeran's X album are among my favorites.
I discovered him after his I see fire track at the end of the hobbit movie.
That is a great song but most of his work is also really good including his earlier work.
What songs would you suggest from his earlier career?
His Plus (+) album released in 2011 is a great start.
I did not know The A Team was on that album, I love that song.
If you enjoy Ed Sheeran you should really explore his five independently released EPs as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of CALL ME MAYBE by Carly Rea Jepsen?
Yes, she looks at the guy fixing his car.
She is washing the car in high heels.
She is trying to get his attention while washing the car.
When he does see her she falls off the car.
I think she hits her head.
She dreams about him.
Then he comes over to help.
She sings for him.
But he gives his number the guy other guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Taylor Swift.
I do, but I am more old school.
Who do you like?
I like the Spice Girls.
Who are they?
They sing that song "If you wanna be my Lover"
Oh, I like that song.
That is one of the most famous songs ever.
Do you have any of their albums?
I have them all.

Did you prefer Britney or Christina, back in the 90's?
Oh, gotta love TRL. That and parents complaining about sexualizing them.
Yeah, I remember that. They think 17 yr olds don't know, but 18 yr olds magically do.
I prefer Christina, 100%
Why? Britney is hotter.
That's not how you judge pop stars.
Britney sold more records.
Christina had and has a much better voice. Britney needs autotune.
But, Britney recovered from going crazy.
Again, that doesn't matter. Christina's voice is the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any good pop music lately?
I'm really into that new Ed Sheeran song.
Do you mean, "Shape of You"?
Yes! That's the one! The beat just makes me want to get up and dance!
I totally know what you mean, I find myself dancing in the car to it when it comes on the radio.
Do you have any other songs you've been into from the pop genre lately?
Of course! Since it's one of my favorite genres, I know a lot of songs in the category.
Name another one that you really like.
I love Bruno Mars' new song, "That's What I Like."
You know, I was really surprised because I love that one too! I don't like much of his new stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
can we talk about Pop Music?
Sure!  I love pop music.  Who do you love?
Well, I really enjoy listening to artist to have really good beats or rhythms in their songs.
Me, too.  Who do you like?
Rhianna.  Adele.  I do not know about Taylor Swift, though.
Yeah, I heard she writes a lot of songs about boyfriend she broke up with.
I heard that, too!
a lot of people really like her music, though.
I know.  I knew  a woman who was  about 30, who swore by her music.  That really surprised me.
right.  A lot of people like her.  I am not sure about liking her music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Calvin Harris has a really nice voice, actually
i didn't even know he sings. i thought he was just a DJ!
he used to sing his own songs sometimes
really!? did he sing slide?
okay no, that one wasn't him. he used to have this song about wanting all the girls, it was a bop
why did he stop singing?
because he wanted to get famous, probably
sucks that you have to compromise like that
he did sing feel so close, though!
which is his best song anyway
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the song by Rag'n'Bone man called Skin?
I dont recognize it.
It is a sweet song that is emotional.
I like the sound of that.
He talks about love and people, it is powerful.
That sounds meaningful and special.
Yes it is emotionally gripping and powerful.
That sounds like a powerful song.
Yes he sings a great tune.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite genre of music?
I like pop music, I know call me mainstream.
What? No, I like pop music too, who are your favorite artists?
Well, I like Justin Bieber.
So you are a belieber?
Well, yes and no. I'm not that crazy about him. How about you? Who do you like?
Well, I'm into the older artists.
Like who?
I like Elvis Presly and Michael Jackson, and some more bands along that line.
I see, they are pretty good. They inspired a lot of the modern artists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of nick jonas?
I think he is just okay.
What about his jealous song that was a huge hit.
I did enjoy that one of his. But what is up with all the girlfriends in videos these days?
What other ones are you talking about?
Well kanye putting kim in the one on the bike then the bed one with tons of celebs.
I think putting your girlfriend in the video had been going for a long time.
I guess I would appreciate it if it were me. But look nick jonas and that model broke up, awkward video now.
I don't know if it is awkward,maybe only because of the lyrics.
Ya a little ironic or makes you wonder is that why you broke up, jealousy issues?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know any Rnb girl groups who held their on own on the Pop music charts?
In the sixties it was the Supremes who had hits on both Rnb and Pop Charts.
What about in the seventies?
I would say the Emotions held their own in both Pop and Rnb. Remember Boogie Wonderland?
What you got for the eighties?
Was TLC eighties or nineties?
TLC was early nineties and so was Blackstreet. You remember them?
Who could forget TLC's "Creep" and Blackstreet's "If you love me?"
In the 2000s there was the Pussy Cat Dolls with "Don't You Wish Your Girlfriend Was Just Like Me."
That was my jam. But they were not Rnb who crossed over to Pop. You gonna make me start breakdancing in a minute. (laughs)
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sia or Adele?
Who am I more in love with?
No, who is the better singer-songwriter?
Sia, for sure.
Why? Adele has so much soul
Yes, but Sia has maturity. She's far older and more experienced.
Adele is writing about her live evolving, though.
Yes, but her style is so one-note. Plus she only knows two dynamics.
Which two?
Piano and FORTISSIMO. There's no middleground. Sia is balanced.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Taylor swift's 1989 album?
I think that is her best album.
I agree. The prior records were more country.
yA , I much prefer her pop music. do you have a favorite song?
Shake it off. SO good!
It is good. Did you see sing?
The cartoon movie?
Yes the one with reese witherspoon as a pig.
I did, doesn't she sing it in the movie?
Exactly, I was going to say that is a really cute and funny take on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Despacito?
Uh no, who is that by?
Daddy Yankee, some other Latin artist, and Jusitn Bieber.
I don't know who Daddy Yankee even is.
He sang that Gasolina song.  Also, Rompe.
Yeah, I still don't know who he is.
Anyway, the Despasito song seems like it shouldn't work on paper, but its pretty good and I really like it.
I've heard it, I'm not crazy about it.
This song taught me what despasito means.
Doesn't it just mean slowly?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You a fan of pop music?
I like some of it.
Like what songs?
I have gotten into One Direction as of late.
But, they broke up.
I know, I am behind the times.
What song of theirs did you like?
I like the one called " Night Moves".
That was a big hit.
I loved the tone of the music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Mariah Carey.
I think she's a huge diva.
You and a lot of other people.
I mean do you like her songs?
Well I think she has a good voice.
I agree with that.
I like her Christmas song,All I Want For Christmas Is You.
That a popular one.
I guess Heartbreaker was ok.
That's not a bad song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Jonas Brothers?
Yes
I wanna get tickets to their show
I heard they are always sold out
Yes. Many people like them
Which one is your favorite?
I like Joe Jonas
He is very cool
Are they still together though?
I am not sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you go to an all pop concert?
You mean like Justin Bieber?
Or Katy Perry?
I would love to hear California Girls in concert.
I bet the ticket cost is through the roof.
No they are a pretty average priced artist group.
Yeah I still do not think that I would afford the cost.
Katy Perry has alot of hits.
Yeah she could do a show of just singles.
What about other songs she has? She could do cover songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the new Calvin Harris song called Slide?
I am not sure I recognize it by name.
You would probably know it if you heard it.
Yes that is true.
It is a sweet jam.
Who else is in the song?
Frank Ocean and Migos are on the track.
Ok I think I have heard it.
It is a great song, it gives me especially great feelings, it is uplifting for going out at night too.
Ok I like that, thank you for mentioning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the MGK single?
What is it called?
No More Sad Songs is the name.
Oh is that the one with Little Mix?
Yes that is the one.
They provide a nice balance of female and male vocals.
Yes you have heard it.
Yes that is a popular jam.
I like it a lot.
I do as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What songs do you like that are pop?
I like songs by One Direction.
Oh that is cool. What song?
I love the song infinity.
I haven't heard that.
Oh it is on their last album.
I should check it out.
Oh definitely.
I have only heard the first album.
Give them more of a try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love pop music. One of my favorite singers is Katy Perry.
I love Katy Perry too. What's your favorite song from her?
I really like Firework.
That's a good song. I'd have to say my favorite Katy Perry song is Hot n Cold.
That's another good song. Did you know it was nominated for a Grammy?
Really? What category was it nominated in?
It was in Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.
Did she win the award for her pop song?
No, Beyonce won the award that year.
Speaking of Beyonce, she's another great pop singer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Britney Spears is making music again?
I did see that but I haven't listened to it yet.
It's actually not bad.
I wouldn't expect it to be. Britney is a queen.
I think the song I heard was called "Make Me" and it had G-Eazy on it.
I'll check it out. Is it from a new album?
Yeah. The album is called "Glory".
That's awesome. I doubt it will top her old stuff, though.
It definitely doesn't. It's cool she's keeping up with the times, though.
Yeah, it would be sad if she just stopped releasing music altogether. She's an icon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Best female pop artist in the 1980s?
Easy, Madonna.
I was thinking of Cyndi Lauper or Whitney Houston.
Those are pretty different. What about Pat Benatar and Joan Jet?
We are all over the place now! So many really good ones then.
How about Stevie Nicks, Tina Turner, and Janet Jackson.
The voice range is so crazy. I really like Annie Lennox. She might be 90's
She has a great voice. Wonder what she is doing now.
Probably Vegas. That seems to be the venue for all of the 80's singers these days.
Yeah, they could do a pretty cool 80's mashup there. Love the retro music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who's  not only a great pop musician and singer but it seems a good person too?
Who you talking about.
Chris Stapleton. I like him a lot.
He seems really down to earth.
Yes he does.
I like his songs Tennessee Whiskey and Fire Away.
They are great tunes.
They were released in 2015'i think.
I think you're right.
From The Traveller album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite pop artist of the seventies?
Probably Fleetwood Mac or The Eagles.
I like them both.
Although The Steve Miller Band was huge.
Finally got into the hall of fame.
How about Kool& The Gang.
Loved them too.
The Spinners were good too.
Yes they were.
Not to mention Barry White.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Do you like pop music?
Yeah it's okay I guess.
Do you have some favorite pop groups?
I like Lorde.
Is she pop?
Yeah I think you could call her that.
She is pretty solid.
I enjoy her music as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best pop star of all time is?
I don't know.  I think maybe Beyonce.
How about Michael Jackson?
Michael Jackson is a legend, but for the younger generations I believe Beyonce is the queen.
Michael Jackson has been a pop fixture since his early days in the Jackson 5.  People still sing the song "I'll be there" even though it is decades old.
That's true.  His songs will be played for a long time.
I don't want to take anything away from Beyonce.  She is very talented.
I think her "Lemonade" album is probably one of her best.  Songs like "Formation" tackled some tough political issues.
I remember her being criticized for being too political in her Super Bowl routine.
She certainly isn't afraid to take a stand when she wants to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the new Despacito song featuring Justin Beiber!
I agree!  He was surprisingly good at speaking in Spanish.
I heard that he won't perform the song in public anymore.
Why is that?
He tried to once and couldn't remember the words so he started making up fake Spanish words.
Ouch, that is pretty embarrassing!
I'm pretty sure he got booed off of the stage.
I wouldn't sing it in public again either if that happened to me.
I still think he is great in the song though.
Me too! It's one of my favorites right now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Zedd song?
Clarity, with Foxes.
Why?
It reminds me of a girl I was madly in love with. The lyrics are exactly how I feel.
Foxes is the name of the singers?
Singer! Singular. She's British.
She's a solo artist and uses a plural name?
Yup! That's just how she is.
That's kind of weird, I'm not going to lie.
Well, at least you like the song, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new song by Coldplay?
What is is it called?
It is called Something Just Like This.
I think so.
It is really fun to listen to.
I like Coldplay.
The song combines Coldplays harmonious voice with a song that can be danced to.
I like the sound of that.
Yes it has good lyrics about wanting something out of life, it is powerful.
I like when sounds sound good and also have good lyrics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who the best-selling pop music artist of all time is?
Do you mean group or individual?
I would like to know both!
The best-selling group is the Beatles. The best-selling artist is Elvis Prestley.
What about Michael Jackson?
He comes in right after Elvis.
I understand. Do you think that order will ever change?
I think so.
Why do you think it will change?
There is better distribution today. So, a great artist like Katy Perry can more easily sell her music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really liked Twenty One Pilots music do you know who they are?
I think I do can you tell me one of their songs?
One of my favorites is "Heathens".
Oh yea I know that song! Wasn't it on the movie Suicide Squad?
Yes it was! I think it was great.
They also sang another great song I love called "Ride."
Yes I know that one! I listened to it over and over as I would drive to school.
Their music is always the best. Not one bad song.
I completely agree.
I need to buy more of their music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what is the difference between the concert types
Concert types?
Yeah like different genres
oh i get what you mean
Like how is a Pop music concert different than rock concert and stuff
Why dont you find out
I do not got the money for that
Why not
Tickets are pretty expensive
They are actually cheaper than you think
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, was just jamming out to Paul Simon's "Graceland" album. Have you heard it?
Yes, I think so. Wasn't there a song on it called, "Diamonds on the Souls of her Shoes?"
Yes, that one is good. There's a lot of great music on that album. Wonder what Paul Simon is producing now?
He married Eddie Brickell. She had that hit "What I Am" a hundred years ago. Good tune.
Wonder if the two of them every made albums together. I always liked "What I am."
Great dance tune. Art Garfunkel, I think he's been out of music for a very long time... I think Garfunkel wasn't happy with Simon.
Simon did go on to be very successful. Wonder what the Police think of Sting now.
Yes, he clearly went on to fame and creativity musically. Sting's solo albums are some of his best work.
Sting really matured into amazing talent, for sure. He's been relevant for a long time musically.
His songs tend to be sad and melancholy though. Remember "Wrapped Around Your Finger?"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard "Scars to Your Beautiful"
Yes, that's Alessia, right?
What's it mean?
It means your scars are part of what makes you beautiful
Yeah, but the title makes no sense.
What do you mean?
"Scars to Your Beautiful" makes no sense as a title.
It's fine to me.
You also got a D in English. "Your Scars Are Beautiful" would be a lot better.
Stop nitpicking things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What current pop song do you think will still be playing 30 years from now?
Ooh, nice. We still have a lot from the 80s that are well-known.
I think anything by Adele will be around for a generation or two, easy.
Yeah, her voice is transcendent.
Nice analysis. Yours?
"Shut up and dance"
Why that one?
It's the perfect dancing song that isn't obnoxious techno that you'd hear in a club, and it's still pop.
The video is amazing.
I think I'm in love with the girl in the video.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop artist?
I don't know, probably Selena Gomez.
I rememeber her from Disney Channel does she sing now?
Yeah she actually just came out with a song with Kygo.
No way! What it is called?
It is called It Ain't Me. I also really like her song Same Old Love.
Oh that's Selena? I think I might have heard of that on the radio.
I also really enjoy Miley Cyrus and her new songs.
I love her new song Malibu.
Crazy how many old Disney stars are dominating pop music!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know about you, but I cannot stop listening to the new Lorde album!
Oh, I know! Melodrama is one of the best albums I have ever heard.
I'm not usually into pop, but this album really changed that for me.
I think its because she really bared her soul to everyone in this album. You feel like she's singing directly to you about her life.
I wasn't a huge fan of Pure Heroine when that first came out, but the more I listened to it the more it grew on me.
Did you see the episode of South Park where they parodied her?
No I didn't. Was it funny?
Oh god yes, it was hysterical. You have to watch it!
What's the name of the episode?
There were two main episodes, though the role was reoccurring, they were  The Cissy and #REHASH
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who is super talented?
Who are you talking about?
Adam Levine. He sounds good all by himself and good in a group.
You are so right! I love his song "Locked Up".
Yes it's the kind of song you can listen to again and again.
I know. The lyrics get stuck in my head.
Me too! I love it though.
He's great in Maroon 5 too!
Yes I think one of my favorite songs is "Moves like Jagger."
Yes it's a very catchy song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite type of music you listen to?
I like pop and dance music the best.
My favorite pop musician is Michael Jackson.
He was a legend, no one will be like him.
My favorite songs of Michael Jackson was Beat It and We are the World.
Yes those are great songs.
What are yours?
I like Beat It and Bad.  Those are fantastic ones.
Bad is one of my favorite albums he made.
Michael wrote so many beautiful ones over the years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is the most important pop artist
babymetal
they arent even pop.
they're considered j pop
but the name is called babymetal for a reason.
then bieber.
yeah, hes pretty relevant now.
or taylor swift
she hasnt released an album in 2 years
oh weird
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez might be getting back together- to work on a song.
I thought she was dating someone else now.
She is, but they are on friendly terms nowadays The song was found on SoundCloud, but it turns out it's an old song they were working on before they split up, and it's unfinished.
How unfinished is it?
Justin has very few vocals, it's mostly Selena's lyrics laid down.
What's the song about?
It's called "Steal Our Love."
Oh, I doubt she would want to finish working on something like that if she's seeing someone else.
It would be really nice if they worked on it together, and Justin somehow managed to steal their love back.
I think he's grown up a little bit, they would probably do a lot better if they gave it a second chance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite song currently?
Julia Michaels - Issues.
Oh I like that song too. I was not sure who was singing it, but enjoy it.
Ya I thought it was selena gomez at first.
I like that a potential new pop sensation is emerging.
WellI hope she has some other songs. Love her voice.
Apparently she has written a bunch of songs for other artists.
Like what and who?
Justin Bieber's Sorry for one.
oh wow, pretty high profile song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like Pop music in general?
yea, I'm obsessed with them, they usually have very good vibe and projects positive images
I agree. So what singers do you listen to most often
I like katy perry, taylor swift, avril lavigne, and recently Paramore has come to my attention as well
Paramore and katy perry's music is more energetic, isn't it
yeah, that's true, unlike the others, I only listen to their music when the day's bright, or my mood is high
I agree on that. It just so nice to have Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne here with us, they always have great music for everyday
yeah, I loved Innocence and 1989 album from taylor swift
who do you like better, taylor swift or avril lavigne?
I honesly can't choose, I love them both
XXXXXXXXXXX
Beyone had a bigger career than anything she did in Destinys Child.
I think Crazy in Love was the apex of her career.
That song was just so good.
Do you think Destinys Child could reunite?
They could and it would make a ton of money.
I dont think she wants to go backwards though
I dont either plus shes survived on her own.
It helped with her husband
So he opened doors?
No I think it was just a boost for her career as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about Avril Lavigne?
I think she's my favorite pop singer, even today
I can't agree more, I was obsessed with her just by listning to her Girlfriend
same, I don't know what's the magic in it, but that song perfectly satisfies every teenagers in middle school
exactly, that's when I got to know Avril Lavgine, in fact she's just couple years older than me
so what other songs do you listen to from her?
she has tons of good songs, like Complicated, Sk8ter Boi, I'm with you etc,.
now that you mentioned those songs, I want to listen to them again
why not, add them to your songs lists, so you won't forget again
definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any good pop music on the radio lately?
Eh...not really.  I've been listening Pandora lately.  I have Robin Schulz as a channel and it's been pretty good for working out
I've heard Schulz's remix of Prayer in C, what else does he have that's worth listening to?
Sugar is quite good.  Funny video.  Features some teenage Canadian singer.. can't remember his name exactly, but it's Yates
What other songs are on there?
I've heard Jasmine Thompson and a few others.  There's a dance remix of Wicked Games on there which is pretty good.
Parra for Cuva?
Yep.  That sound familiar.  They also have some remixes of older songs as well.
Oh? like what?  That sounds interesting
I just heard a remix of Is You or Is You Aint My Baby by Dinah Washington and Spooky by Dusty Springfield.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think pop music is so popular in any decade?
Probably because it is so repetitive. It's like brain washing of sorts.
Are you saying that it doesn't take much to entertain the youth.
Yes pretty much  that's exactly what I am saying.
Simple things for simple minds. Yep guilty as charged. I fell victim as well to pop music when I was a kid.
Well think about it if it has the catchy chorus or some other "hook" then you are all set for the big time.
The thing is the "hook" as you put it also helps generate more revenue through clothes that these entertainers wear
Yes that is very true. Good Point.
I am going to leave you now and go put my bell bottoms on and halter top.
Hey don't forget your puka shell necklace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was doing some research on pop music and found out that a cartoon had a number 1 song on the Billboard chart.
What song is that?
It was called Sugar Sugar.
Who was it by?
The Archies.
You mean the characters that are in the TV series Riverdale?
Actually, this was back in the days when the Archies had a cartoon TV series.
When was this?
In the 1960s.
I didn't know this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Pop band?
Well I know they are also considered rock but I would definitely choose Coldplay.
I really like Coldplay, yeah they are pop-rock but have done a lot of pop songs, as they are a very diverse band.
My recent favorites has to be "just like this".
I liked that song as well, but my favorite is "hymn for the weekend".
Both are great songs and I love how diverse they are as a band.
They are really diverse from their earlier work, to the more recent experimental rock and pop they have made some excellent music.
The GhostStories album had a different feeling to it but I enjoyed it all the same.
I think one of the things that makes them so diverse is their ability to collaborate with other great artists.
I agree, we even kinda pointed that out earlier with our favorites, being that "just like this" was a collab with the chain-smokers and  "hymn for the weekend" was a collab with beyonce.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Britney Spears song?
I love Toxic.
Oh me too. It's such a great song to dance too.
Exactly. Plus it's aged well.
Very true. I really like Oops I Did It Again.
Oh that's a solid song.
Yeah, it was pretty good to dance to in middle school.
You know, I used to know the moves from the chorus.
Oh nice! I only knew moves for Hit Me Baby One More Time.
Hey that's still very impressive!
XXXXXXXXXXX
is Taylor Swift the biggest pop artist around today?
Thats tough but I think she is
I loved Wildest Dreams
To me that was too slow.
So what was your favorite from her?
I dont have one because I am not a huge fan
Do you think Rihanna is bigger than her?
Yeah she crossed more genres.
She is an international artist as well
I highly doubt that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
I like it sometimes.
What songs have you been listening  to lately?
I'm enjoying "Shape of You" by Ed Sheeran.
Oh, I don't usually like him, but I like that song.
Yes, it is different from some of his other songs, but I do like the others, too.
What other songs would you recommend?
I love "Thinking Out Loud".
I've heard that one. I don't like it.
I guess we will have to agree to disagree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would say is the greatest pop song of all time?
Wow, that's a good question.
I would say it's Billie Jean by Michael Jackson.
That's a pretty good choice.
What's yours?
I would say it's Bye Bye Bye by Nsync.
Excuse me, you think Nsync has the greatest pop song of all time?
Yeah, it sold a ton of cd's.
I guess that is true.
Plus, it is one of those songs that when someone says pop music and plays it, you're like that's pop music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you listen to most of your music?
I stream nowadays, but I have an iPod as well.
Oh, cool. Put your iPod on shuffle and see what we get.
It gave me Kylie Minogue.
I absolutely love Kylie. Do you know if she has any new singles coming out?
I heard she's back in the studio.
Is she still with Roc Nation?
No she left after Kiss Me Once underperformed.
To be honest, that album deserved it.
It wasn't up to her usual standards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite pop song?
I really like Backstreet's Back.
Really? Why that song?
I always thought Nick Carter's line about being sexual was hilarious.
Okay, I can see that.
What's your favorite pop song?
That's a tough one, but I think it's Can't Get You Out Of My Head.
By Kylie Minogue?
Yep, that's the one.
Oh, that's a great dance song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Justin Bieber is my favorite pop artist.
Seriously? Not a lot of people like him.
I know, but I really like his music.
Yeah, musically he is very talented.
I love his older songs the best.
Oh, what's your favorite one?
I think it would have to be Baby.
I think that song is what rose him to fame.
Yeah, you're right. What is your favorite song by him?
I like his newer song Sorry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What pop artists have you been listening to?
I have been listening to Hailee Steinfeld.
Oh cool. I have not really listened to her much.
You should give her a shot. She is talented.
I bet she is.
I like the song Hell Nos and Headphones.
I will check out that song.
I heard her live too and she was very good.
Nice, I will maybe buy some songs.
Buy the album too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's your favorite pop singer?
the position in my heart definitely belongs to Avril Lavigne
then what's your favorite song from her?
she has a lot of great music, I like complicated, innocence,etc.
those two song's style kinda different,right?
yeah, complicated is more guitar focused, while innocence has a soft piano and drum in the background
do you still listen to those songs?
haha, I do but secretly
why it has to secret?
because those songs have some of my personal feelings
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the new pink track ?
I have not  but I  really like  her voice
It is  very powerful and  she  hits  amazing notes
I really  liked  perfect thats my  favorite  track
It is  really upbeat  and  has a nice  message
I would like to see her do a  duet with  Axle rose
It would be  so vocally strong  but  could they pick  the  right  vocals
I think they could work it out they are  both very artistic
It could be  like  Novemeber rain meets   Perect  it would  rock so much
I would  have bought that track

I bought the new Katy Perry album.
I didn't know she had one. What's it called?
It's called Witness. It has that song on it Chained to the Rhythm.
Oh I really liked that song. Really good for Katy, at least.
Yeah it's a cute song, but the album isn't really my thing.
Really? Why not?
I think she tried to make it really deep, but it comes off as shallow.
That's surprising. I really like Katy Perry, too.
I normally do too. But I think I'm just gonna stick with Selena Gomez's next LP.
If it's as good as Bad Liar, we'll be in luck!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Ed Sheeran song?
Shape of you for sure.
Good song, but why?
Well, women love it and hate being objectified. But it's ALL about objectification.
So you're saying women are hypocritical?
If they love this song and hate it, then possibly.
Okay... you're weird. I like Thinking Out Loud.
Which is that? I don't know too much of him.
That's the really sweet love song "People fall in love in mysterious ways"
Oh, right. I can at least appreciate that he learned the dance and didn't hire Ron Weasely for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like Marina and the Diamonds?
I like her a lot.
Me too. I find I relate to a lot of her music.
Same. What's your favorite song of hers?
Probably Scab and Plaster.
Oh that's a good one!
Do you have a favorite?
I need to listen to her newest album to make a decision.
Oh yeah I need to listen to that too.
But I really like her song Bubblegum Bitch
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Beyoncé is one of the top pop artists today?
Yes I think she is.
Yea,I do too.
A lot of hit songs.
The album Lemonade was huge.
Yes it was.
Adele beat her out for all of the awards though.
Well,I think she's a step above everyone.
I think your right.
Beyoncé is a close second.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to the new Katy Perry album?
No, I've heard a lot about it though! What did you think?
I like it! I'm a big Katy Perry fan, and I think a lot of the criticism of the album has been unfair.
What is your favorite song on her new record?
I like Roulette and Hey Hey Hey a lot.
I will have to check those out. I love Bruno Mars new song.
Oh, what is his new song? I don't think I've heard it.
Its called "That's What I Like."
I think I've seen the video. Is it where he dances around in an empty room?
Yep! It is the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop music artist?
I would say it's Michael Jackson.
Why is it Michael Jackson?
He had so many good songs.
What's your favorite song?
I really like Man in the Mirror.
Most people say Billie Jean.  Why is it man in the mirror?
It's a really deep song if you listen to the lyrics.
He did have a lot of songs that made you think.
That's why I think he's great.  He made songs that were catchy but also deep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite Hip-hop star?
Rihanna is currently dominating my spotify.
I enjoy her music, especially her recent hit "Work".
I still get  "Umbrella" tuck in my head all the time.
She adds a great energy to her music which is part of the reason most of it is so catchy.
Did you know Rihanna had her first top 100 hit 12 years ago?
No, I did not know that what was the song.
Considering she is 27 years old so she has been making music for a long time. The song was called "Pon de Replay".
I have never heard it but I will give it a listen.
You should give her early work a chance most of is as great as her current work.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I like Closer.
Who sings that?
The Chainsmokers.

Me too.
After I turn it up I roll the windows down and enjoy listening.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
is it me or it's true that top pop singers are all females?
Now that you mentioned, I do think it's kinda true
yea, you see, we have Lorde, Anitta, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry,etc. all females
maybe it has something to do with the genre, let's say it's a feminine genre
but there are few exceptions though, like we also have Ed Sheeran and imagine dragons,etc.
yea, they are the exceptions, but I still feel their songs are kinda feminine
interesting obervation, but anyway, do you have a favorite pop singer?
If I have to choose, it's katy perry
Why?
she's never giving me visual fatique, both visually and vocally
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I think is so great about pop music?
What is that?
I think that it is great how you can really watch an artist grow up through it.
I can see that. Like Justin Bieber.
Oh yeah, he was just a child when he became popular. Now he is a full grown man.
Or look at Gwen Steffani. She has been in the spotlight for over twenty years.
True. I really miss music from her band No Doubt.
Yeah, I haven't heard anything new from them in awhile.
I think she is doing more solo things now.
Well she certainly is talented enough for it.

I do like Rihanna's voice,but not really her.
She has a great voice.
Yes she does.
I do like Diamonds.
That was really good.

Are there many pop bands still?
Plenty! The Temper Trap is my favorite.
Their name sounds familiar. Would I know any of their songs?
Maybe! You might know "Sweet Disposition"
I think I have heard that one before!
You probably have. It has been licensed for many projects.
What kind of projects?
Movies like 500 Days of Summer and commercials for products like Coke
Those campaigns must pay super well!
They do! The band gets a big check when a company wants to use their music in an ad
XXXXXXXXXXX
pop music was better in the 90's

She was hot in that one.
I loved her album In the Zone.

Toxic.
I think she still has mental issues.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your preferred genre of music?
I guess I'm into pop music, above all other types.
Yeah, me too. I've been on a Taylor Swift kick lately.

They should do a duet sometime.
That duet would make people's heads explode.
Totally. What's your favorite song by T-Swift?
I like "Blank Space" and "Style".
I think I'd choose "Love Story" and "22". What about Adele?
My favorite Adele song is "Hello"... so amazing. Makes me cry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of a group called The Monkees?
I haven't. Are they a new group?
Actually they were really popular in the 1960s.
That's way before my time.
It is, but you probably know of one of their songs.
Which song is that?
I'm a Believer.
The song from the Shrek movie?
There was a version of it in Shrek, but The Monkees did the original version.
I had no idea the version in the movie was a remake.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite pop song that came out so far this year?
Oh, my current favorite has to be Closer by the Chainsmokers.
I have heard that song so much lately, but haven't gotten tired of it yet somehow.
Me neither. I've also heard a good amount of Lady Gaga on the radio.
Really? I didn't think she had come out with any new songs lately.
That's true. They are some of her older songs like Paparazzi and Bad Romance.
Oh, I see. I like those. My favorite that came out this year is probably the new Coldplay song.
I haven't heard that one yet actually.
It's a good one. It's a good crossover between rock and pop.
Yeah, Coldplay is really good at that.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Yeah he had a lot of problems but still he was the King of Pop.
Did you see his last documentary about rehearsing for this concert?
Ah yeah, This is It.
Yeah he was totally going to play his classics, like Thriller and Beat It.
That is awesome, the music video for Thriller is such a classic.
So is the music video for Beat It. Think I'll watch it now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Beyonce is a good pop singer?
I think she's great.
She does have a lot of hit songs.
Almost every song she does now becomes a number one song.
Do you remember Destiny's Child?
I remember it when they had Beyonce and the original two girls.
What ever happened to them?
They tried to sue Beyonce a few years ago, but failed.
What about the two new girls, Kelly and Michelle, what happened to them.

I don't think it has ever been better, so many great artists.

I really like Rihanna and Katy Perry.
I love both of them too. They each have so many catchy songs.

Songs like umbrella and disturbia.
Nice, I think her songs have aged well.
Me too, looking forward to her new stuff too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do would you say is your favorite pop artist?
It would be a tie between Britney Spears and Fergie.
I like Britney a lot, but I can't stand Fergie anymore.
Really? Why don't you like Fergie?
It just feels like she's not trying anymore.
I agree, she was better with The Black Eyed Peas, but I still think she's a strong singer.
Well, that's the probelm, she's a strong singer, but her songs are straight up rubbish anymore.
Why do you say that?
Take M.I.L.F Money for example,  that song didn't make any damn sense. The lyrics and the style were all over the place.
Ok, you have a point with ONE song, but I still don't think she's all bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to Britney Spears?
I never was a fan, but I know all about her.  Pretty much everyone does.
Why didn't you like her?
She kind of had a nasally voice.  I just didn't care for it.
Did you know her sister is still in the music business?

I think she used to be, but she's writing music now.
Really, anything good?

Well, I wouldn't have expected that.

I really love Rihanna.
She has a very unique voice. What's your favorite song she has?
It's newer but I love "Work". It's so catchy and fun.
I agree. That song makes me want to dance.
It's different from most of her other songs, too. I think that's cool.
It definitely shows a bit of diversity.

I like "Umbrella". It was the first song I heard by her and that's when I fell in love with her voice.
That songs is fantastic. I had forgotten about it until now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go see Justin Bieber with me?
Sure, I'm really starting to like his music.
Me too. I love the song "Sorry" I was just listening to it actually.
Now that he's grown up, his talent is really starting to show.
I know that you mean. I used to think he was such a spoiled brat.
I think its a lot to become as famous a he did, basically overnight.
True. He was only 14 when he really hit it big.
Exactly. I really commend the fact that he's done public apologies for his behavior.
Yeah, it takes a lot to go on live television and admit you were wrong.
Yeah, I don't know it I could do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the new DJ Khaled song?
He is a great DJ, I have not heard any new songs by him, to my knowledge.

It is fun and harmonious, smooth and yet exciting.
Wow that sounds great, thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Yes.
tH
They were an awesome band
I was more into Britney Spears back then.
In the 90's?
Yes. She had a lot of hits.
Do you still listen to her?
No. Just her old stuff.
I would like to hear Baby One More Time right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Sia?
I don't really listen to her much, but I don't have anything bad to say about her.
So, you like her music?
It's not bad.  At least it isn't annoying like a lot of other music.
No, but she's kind of weird.
I don't know.  The hair thing?
Yeah, that and the weird videos and stuff.
Well, I figure the hair is for her to stay anonymous.
Oh, that would be smart.
Yeah, she could probably easily go out in public.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new song called Symphony by Clean Bandit?
I am not sure.
You probably would recognize it if you heard it.
Ok I can dig that.
It is a classic good track for our modern times.
What is so good about it?
A womans smooth and powerfully emotional voice with good instrumentals.
Oh is it a fast or slow song.

I will have to listen to it, thank you for mentioning it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Bruno Mars?
I think he is a very talented singer.
Do you know what his real name is?

Peter Gene Hernandez is his real name.
Bruno Mars is a much better stage name. I understand why he chose it.
I love his newest song "That's What I Like"

His production team is very impressive. They have a vast musical knowledge.
It definitely shows in the new tracks I have heard!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Miley Cyrus's new song Malibu?
I have and I like it.
I think it's much better than the other songs she's done since she stopped being Hannah Montana.
Oh I loved the Hannah Montana songs.
Me, too. G N O is probably my favorite.
I think Rock Star was one of her best songs.
I like how she always had new music playing on her TV show.
I watched her show all the time.
Maybe her music is getting back to that kind of style again.
I hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do people call Michael Jackson "The King of Pop?"
He made a lot of contributions to the genre. His elaborate music videos are just one example.
What were music videos like before he came along?
Most of them were just performance footage. Michael Jackson changed all of that with "Thriller."
Wasn't that the one with Vincent Price and the zombies?
Yes. Don't forget the werewolf!
That looked so cheesy.
It was the 80s. Don't forget his dancing skills.
Have you ever seen his moonwalk?
I'm more of a fan of his work on "Beat It."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is a female pop artist you like listening to?
I think probably Katy Perry.
Yeah she's pretty good.
She got her start in gospel music as a start.
That's interesting. I guess she writes her own music.
Some of it is amusing.
Like?
Like California Gurls. She's not taking some things seriously.
She's having a good time with it.
Firework is a touching song of hers!
XXXXXXXXXXX

Oh, which ones are your favorites?
I like Roar and I really like the one from the Disney movie.
Oh, the one from Malificent?  That one was awesome!

I feel like every time I turn on the TV i am hearing Katy Perry music.
Her songs are in a lot of commercials these days.
True, plus I feel like she's on the news and entertainment tv a lot.
She is, but she's a mega pop star and her tunes are really catchy.
Catchy and fun.  I still like to drive around to California Girls.
I can see you doing that. I still like Dark Horse.
I would like it more if Kanye West wasn't on it.

Yeah, there are so many better artist to collaborate with these days anyway.

Yea, Castle on the Hill reminded me of my childhood.
Exactly. Photograph gives me a lot of nostalgia.
Same here, Ed Sheeran is great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Spanish music?
Sometimes I do.
There is this one song I like a lot.
What is it called?
Despacito by Luis Fonsi is a jam.
There is something special about Spanish songs.
Yes the language sounds great in a song.
Yes words that end with vowels are fun to listen to, they sound melodic in great songs.

I want to hear this song you told me about, I am looking forward to then.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I would love to and I'm sure you will love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Speaking of pop music, do you think the format of it has changed over the years?
Most definately. Just look at pop music songs over previous decades.
Why do you think it has changed?
Well, less restrictions in wording in music for starters.
I don't understand.
Well, 25 years ago saying "Bitch" or "Damn" or "Dick" was an offence the FCC would come down on you hard for.
Really? That's crazy!
Yes, and even farther back you couldn't even give a hint of sexuality.
No Way! I find that hard to believe,
Yes, There was quite the controversy when Donna Summer had a pop music smash where she moaned in a sexual manor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do pop musicians still play the piano?
Many do actually!
I don't know any. Can you tell me one?
John Legend is an amazing piano player.
I forgot about him. His music is excellent.
One of his newest songs called "Love Me Now" is so beautiful.

XXXXXXXXXXX
I got some scary news for you
What could you possibly say that is scary
Well i got some
Well spill it
You know all that music you like

One day it will be considered pop music
Why is that
Because when it gets popular with age it is pop music
That is nonsense
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you really think Michael Jackson was the king of pop?
I suppose I do
What about Prince?
Yeah. I actually like Purple Rain better than Thriller.
What about Janet Jackson?
That velvet rope album turned me out.
I think Beiber is pretty great
I need you to stop talking. he's terrible.
What about Bruno Mars?
He's great of course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Justin Bieber?
I would say no but his last few songs have been great.
He's been collaborating with some great people, for sure.
I was a big fan of the one he did with Major Lazer.
'Cold Water'? Yeah, that's a great song.
Have you heard 'I'm The One'?
With DJ Khaled? That's going to be a huge summer hit.
Sure is, it's so happy and summery.
I've already heard it blasting out of cars everywhere.
It's such a catchy pop song, though!
XXXXXXXXXXX

No way I think they are still relative.
Nick Lachey married Jessica Simpson.
Oh yeah they had that MTV show.
Yes, but they are no longer together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Britney Spears. Is she still around?
I believe so. I've heard a lot of people talking about listening to new music from her. I believe it's new music.
Oh. She seemed to go disappear a decade ago.
She's definitely not as popular as she once was.
That's for sure. She was the top pop artist at one time.
Yes, late 1990s and early 2000s.
Yes, that time period. She's getting older as well. That must be why I haven't heard much from her lately.
Other artists that are younger seem to be getting much more play time it seems.
I couldn't name any of those new artists. I guess I'm getting older as well.
We all are. Our lives get busier as well and it's more difficult to keep up with the latest music.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I just read where Michael Jackson's Thriller is going to be released this summer.
Why is it being rereleased?
Because it's being turned into a 3D movie.
Is his family OK with that?
Two of his kids are involved in the project.
Who's making it?
John Landis who directed the original video is overseeing the project.
I loved the original Thriller. If this is going to be in 3D, I'll definitely want to see it.
It's going to be shown at IMAX theaters.
We should go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Cyndi Lauper?
She's the best!
I'm also a big fan, from girls just want to have fun, to true colors, great stuff.
She always seemed to be more individual as a person than a lot of other pop artist's.
I agree with that assessment, remember the sing she did for The Goonies?
Oh how could I ever forget that, had a really fun video as well.
Actually it's my favorite video ever made.
It's in my top five or so, is she still performing?
She is, opened for Cher a couple years back, didn't get to go though.
Too bad, would've been a really fun show to attend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
Definitely! Who is your favorite artist?
Justin Timberlake, for sure!
I love Justin Timberlake!
His new album is absolutely amazing.
The 20/20 Experience is one of my favorite albums of all time!
What is your favorite song on it?
It is so hard to choose. Probably Suit and Tie.
That is a really good one. Mine is probably Blue Ocean Floor.
Oh, that is a great one too! I am surprised you chose that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow Selena Gomez?
I've never been a fan of her music to be honest.
I'm surprised, since I thought you liked pop music.  You don't like 'Same Old Love?'
I think that whoever produced the music is incredibly talented, but as a vocalist I don't think Selena stands out too much.
But she has a good voice.
I think she has an okay voice but lacks technique.
I guess we will have to agree to disagree.  I love 'It Ain't Me.'
I don't know that one.
It's a Kygo song that she is featured in.
I may check it out since I actually really like Kygo.  His remix of Sheeran's
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the better pop artist Rhianna or Taylor Swift
That is very hard to choose because both have different sounds.
Very True, Rihanna has a Regae pop sound and Taylor Swift is the girl next door.
I agree they sounds totally different. What is your favorite Rihanna song.
I love "Pon De Replay". I know it is very old but it is my all time favorite
I would have to say "We Found Love" is the best, but I also love "Pon De Replay"
That is a great choice also. What is your all time favorite Taylor Swift song,
"Shake It Off" is one of the best song in my opinion. What about you?
"Blank Space" is one of my favortive song.
Great choice I love that one also
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rihanna is a very talented singer.
I agree. She releases very impressive music.
Do you know where she is from?
No! I always wondered that though.
She is from Barbados.
That makes so much sense. I always thought she had an interesting accent.
You can't hear her accent when she sings usually though.
I agree. That is especially true in powerful songs like "Stay"
She had quite an impressive repertoire. I am amazed at how many songs she has released.
It's true. She has won a lot of awards for songs as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Destiny's Child?
Yes, I love Beyonce.
Do you like her solo songs?
Yes, but her stuff with Destiny's Child is amazing.
I agree. I liked that band a lot.
What is your favorite song?
Survivor.
Mine too.
Do you have their CD's still?
Yes, of course I do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you listening to?
My man, Bruno Mars.
I love his sound. The guy is talented.
Agree.  I'm going to see him this summer when he's in Vegas.
Sweet! Have you seen him in concert before?
Believe it or not, I was in the audience at Ellen when he performed Uptown Funk.
That's crazy. I would love to see him in person.
Did you see him on Carpool Karaoke?
Yes, so funny with Bruno and James Corden.
Bruno is short, but his talent is huge!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's up with Miley Cyrus?
oh I'm not really sure what she's up to, she's crazy
haha, indeed. I heard she had random sex with her fans one time?
yea, I'm wondering if she's always high. But nonetheless, she's a good singer
what song do you listen to then?
I listen to her songs a lot when at parties, girls loved it, like Party in the U.S.A
that song! I still remember people singinig along with it last time at the college bar
for sure, her song is even more popular in college town and fraternity clubs
what song do you recommend the most from her?
I think wrecking ball is cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to pop music?
Sometimes, I don't really like anything too ridiculous like most boy bands or bubble gum pop though.
Ha, I know what you mean. Do you like Halsey? She's popular lately.
I do actually, but not as much as a lot of people I know. I think I like her fashion and hair better than her music.
I like the song she did with the Chainsmokers.
Oh, closer? That was pretty good. The Chainsmokers have been putting out some hits lately.
I know, I like their song with Coldplay too. They do a lot of collaborations.
Yes, Something Just Like This. I like that song a lot.
What's their newest hit called?
It's called Paris. I like that one too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the song Perfect by Ed Sheeran?
Not by name, I do not know it.
You may have heard it, it is truly special.
What is so great about it?
Every lyric, every word he says is meaningful and perfect.
Ok that is nice.
Yes and he is talking about human relationships, it interesting also.
Wow that sounds like an intelligent song.
Yes he tells a powerful story about relationships and it sounds good too.
I like that, I want to listen to this song now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who I like as a pop singer?
No,who do you like.
I like Miley Cyrus.
You know,I do too.
She really has a great voice.
Yes she does.
I like her Wrecking Ball album.
Yea,back in 2008.
How about the song,We Can't Stop?
I love that song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the Flight of the Conchords?
Yeah, they're musicians?
And comics too.  They're music is great.
Is it all funny?
No, some of it is a touch sad too.
They do a pretty good rap as well.
That Hippopotamus song you mean?
That's the one. You should hear it.
I heard they have a good album.
Its completely awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk Bruno Mars. Do you think he is the best pop singer of our generation?
He is definitely at the top, I don't know if he is the best.
He has had so many hits in the last few years though.
He has, but so have other pop singers.
Well who would you say is the best?
I think the band Maroon 5 is up there.
Why them?
They have been around for quite a while now and have had so many #1's.
Well, I would put them as #2 on my top pop singers chart.
Fair, I would put Bruno Mars as #2 on my pop chart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Coldplay is a good group?
Yeah but I dont think they make pop music.
What about Boy George?
He is definitely a pop musician.
Did you find him offensive?
Not really, all musicians are quirky.
I really like what he did in Culture Club.
It was a phenomenon in the 80s.
Would you ever listen to that kind of music again?
Yes I love pop sensibilities.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Carley Rae Jepsen?
Yeah, she sang Call Me Maybe, I remember that song.
What do you think of it?
It's pretty corny. Some people say it's catchy but I don't see it.
Well, she has done other stuff, it couldn't hurt to check her other stuff out.
I'll give her other stuff a listen one of these days.
I don't recommend It Takes Two. The original was a great rap song, but this version isn't very good.
Remakes don't tend to be as good as the originals, though.
There have been some, though, that were pretty good.
I remember Tainted Love being one of the exceptions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Britney Spears is the best pop artist out there.
No way. Maybe two decades ago, but not now.
Okay. Who do you think is better?
Well for starters Ariana Grande has much more range and vocal ability than Britney.
I'll give you that, but you can't deny that Britney's voice is unique. On top of that, she is a great performer.
That is true. Her Las Vegas shows were very popular.
Yes, she will always be an icon.
I wonder what made her career blossom so much more than Christina Aguilera's.
I think Britney had the southern belle thing going on which made her seem more lovable.
You may be right, but I would rather listen to Genie in a Bottle than Baby One More Time any day!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the song by Future called Mask Off?
No I dont think so.
It is getting pretty popular lately.
I will have to check it out.
It has a really great beat that makes me want to dance.
That is always good.
The lyrics are also funny.
I like when rap songs are funny.
Yes there is a lot going on in this song.
Ok I will have to check that out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Fifth Harmony?
Kind of. Their music is okay.
I love their songs. They have such good voices.
I guess that's true. I think they are trying to be like The Pussycat Dolls
Yeah. You are right.
They are too young for that though!
I like their cover of Impossible.
It's really beautiful.
I wish they would make new songs.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
Yes, I don't mind it. It isn't my favorite genre but it is catchy.
Anything in particular that you like?
Well, I grew up in the 90s so I'm partial to the late 90s/early 2000s pop.
Oh, so you are into the boy bands and the teen idols.
I guess you can say that. I mean, who can really turn down Backstreet Boys or N*Sync?
If you say so! I like the more recent music like Bruno Mars, Pharrel, and Ariana Grande.
That's definitely not my style. Give me some Spice Girls and Britney Spears, though, and I'll be happy.
I'd love the Spice Girls to make a return.
That would be amazing. They did it once, but unfortunately just for a short time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Allie X finally released Collxtion II?
She did? Wow, it's been so long!
I know. I've been waiting for it to come out since forever.
Did any cuts from the mixtape make it on?
Yeah, she put on That's So Us, thankfully.
That was one of my favorites, too.
She actually also worked with Troye Sivan on his album.
Did she really? I didn't hear that.
Yeah, and I think he might have written on Allie X's album, too.
I can see that being a really interesting pairing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to the Goo Goo Dolls?
I first heard them on the Twister soundtrack.
Did you like their CD's?
No, I did not.
But, I thought you liked them.
I only liked one of their songs.
Were they a pop group?
Yes. But, they were also rock.
Cool. I will check them out. When were they big?
In the 90's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Madonna is such a talented artist. It's a shame that her album sales have been so low.
Her last great album was Hard Candy. I don't even know any of the songs from Rebel Heart.
Hard Candy was amazing. I love the song 4 Minutes.
That song is so catchy, and anything with Justin Timberlake is a win.
Come to think of it I can't think of anything he's released recently.
Neither can I. The only songs I know of his are What Goes Around Comes Around and My Love.
I can't believe how long it's been since those songs were released!
It's crazy, isn't it?
Maybe Madonna and Justin should do another song together.
I would love to hear what they could come up with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen BEAUTY AND THE BEAT by Justin Beiber?
They had a lot of extras for that video.
He wants to show me off.
We're going to party.
Party like it's 3012 tonight.
I want to show you all the finer things in life.
I'm coming for you.
All I need.
All I need is a beauty and a beat.
I love Justin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe that Britney Spears is still so popular?
Well, she was considered the princess of pop.
Baby One More Time is still popular now with the young teens.
I know. A lot of the older songs have made a comeback.
Well after all the crazy things she's done, she can still perform.
Yeah, she can.
What was your favorite song?
I think Oops! I Did It Again.
I forgot that one.
Think that's still played on radio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have some questions for you girl it's all about music i heard this new song by Taylor Swift it's Pop music the song is shake it off. You like Pop music don't you?
Yeah it's cool so why the questions about that song it's been out for a while now.
I know i just want to have something to talk about for awhile and since i love music i figured i would see what Pop songs you like too.
Did you see her video it was really cool she had all these dancers rump shaking their butts.
Yes the dancers where great and looked really nice in those ballet outfits.
Oh there's another song that caught me by Taylor and it really had my spirits up about men. Can you guess which hit song it was?
I Guess i know which one you are going to say was it blank space? I was really big on this one.
Yes your guess was right it was blank space she really hit the tops with that song. and the video was really cool too.
The records she comes out with can really make you feel her songs they make you think and make you dance.
Okay it was really nice talking to you about this Pop Star Taylor smith but i have to go i'm going to be late for work thanks for the chat see you around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If he was around still do you think Elvis would be considered pop?
Yes I do he was definitely one of those kinds of artists
He did span a variety of genres.
Yes but they all had mass appeal which is really what pop music is
Hound dog would be a radio hit in my opinion.
Yes it would be and jailhouse rock would be an anthem for people
He really wrote a ton of great stuff.
And he made everyone like him too
Did he write his own music?
For the most part he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Michael Jackson's Thriller is my favorite record of all time.
Yeah, I loved that album when I was a kid. You can't beat Beat It and Billie Jean.
The song Thriller was great too but I never really got into the music video.
I think the video was awesome. It was groundbreaking for it's time.
Do you remember the song Somebody's Watching Me by Rockwell?
Yeah man, that was a great song.
Michael Jackson did the vocals in the chorus of that song.
That's awesome, that's probably why I liked it so much.
80's music turned out to be really good didn't it?
Yup, it's still what I listen to more than anything else today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Who do you like in the pop music world today?
Hmm let me think.
Sure.
I like Selena Gomez.
Really?
Yeah I've followed her since her time on Disney.
Oh I forgot she was on one of those shows.
Yeah that's right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of miley cyrus
i only know wrecking ball
do you like wrecking ball
no, it was stupid
how is it stupid?
who wants a song about a wrecking ball
its a metaphor. ever heard of it?
well, its about a relationship, right?
yeah, he came in like a wrecking ball
thats in the lyrics!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who Imagine Dragons are?
I am not sure, can you tell me one of their songs?
They sing a song called "Radioactive".
I remember that from the radio!
Yes I put the song on my phone so I could listen to it over and over.
They kind of remind me of One Republic or something similar.
They kind of do. Also remind me of Fall Out Boy.
Yes them too!
I love "Uma Thurman" by Fall Out Boy.
Me too! It's my son's favorite as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, here's something kind of a weird... music I like but hate the music video.
Huh... can't think of any songs like that off-hand, but one might pop in my mind while talking.
Well, I got one to start with Pink's "Try".
I don't think I've seen the video for that.
Well, like I said, I really, really like that song, to me it projects an image of preserving despite adversity and all, but the video has Pink and some random guy beat the crap out of each other while performing dance moves.
Say what?
Yeah, they're in a room together with all this paint and stuff and they get slapping and hitting each other.  I mean, I get it, it's all symbolic and relationships and stuff and how we can hurt each other real easily, but still.
Yeah... you're thinking, "They could have found a better way to convey that?"
Exactly! I mean, I don't know.. just was not what I was expecting.
Well, that's the interesting thing about songs, there's all kinds of different ways to interrupt them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Jonas Brothers fan?
I loved their old music.
Have you heard any of there new stuff?
Like DNCE?
I love their song Cake By the Ocean.
It is such a hip song.
I loved the music video for that song.
Have you heard any of Nick Jonas' new songs?
Yeah, his song Jealous is really good.
I am so glad they are still making music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you like to listen to?
I like so many different types. I guess it depends on my mood at the time.
I am the same way. When I want to get in a good mood I listen to pop.
Oh yeah, who is your favorite pop artist?
The king of pop of course, Michael Jackson.
He does have a lot of songs that make you want to get up and dance.
I know in 1982 he came out with some of the greatest songs ever.
Like Beat It and Thriller. The videos were amazing.
His dancing was amazing I could watch them all day.
The moon walk was the best move ever. I practice it for months but never really mastered it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like justin bieber
to be honest, i do
i didnt like him until recently
his new album is actually so good
you mean purpose?
yeah, he has been on his game
the melodies have been so tight.
im a guilty fan
i am too now.
at least i am not alone
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you still listen to the Backstreet Boys?
I have not in 10 years.
What happened to them
They burst with the boy band bubble.
That was a great era in music
Yeah for girls who like pop music.
I think guys liked their songs
Theres no way that can be true
If they toured I bet guys would go
No way that music was for women only
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Bruno Mars new song?
Which one?
Thats what I like
Yea its a really good song
I like it too, i just heard it on the radio
I like a lot of bruno mars songs
Yea grenade was a good one
I liked that one too
He is a good artist
Yes he is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of CALL ME MAYBE by Carly?
They guy and great abs.
And he has tattoos.
Then he looks at her.
She is so embarrassed.
Then she hides.
He thinks it is funny.
She has her garage band.
All the other boys try to chase me.
But here's my number.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the best female pop singer in the 1980s?
I would say Madonna.
What's your favorite song of hers?
Meterial Girl.
I really like Cyndi Lauper.
The singer who sang Girls Just Want to Have Fun?
That and True Colors.
She was pretty good. I also think Paula Abdul was good.
Wasn't she a judge on American Idol?
Yes, she was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Taylor Swift?
Well she's a beautiful girl, but I'm not impressed by her music.
So you think that she is just another manufactured pop star?
Yes, I think that the only requirement is good looks.
Well that's important to sell music to people now.
Yes, but I yearn for the older days of popular music.
I think that you are being naive in thinking that pop music has ever been about more than money.
Well what about the Beatles?
Yes, I guess that their music was popular and critically good as well.
That time of skilled musicians with popularity seems to have vanished from the music scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lady Gaga is such a fantastic musician!
What instruments does she play?
She plays plenty! I have definitely seen her play guitar and piano before.
She played those during her Super Bowl halftime performance, didn't she?
She did! Wasn't that a phenomenal show?
It really was! My favorite part was when she dropped down from the top of the stadium.
I loved that part too. She must have had a big stunt team help her with that.
She has always done interesting performances and the halftime show was no different.
I saw her perform David Bowie songs at the Grammy's too. Those were really cool!
She did a great job with that too. I loved that she had hair just like Bowie during the performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pop is such a weird category. It's like a catch-all bucket that you can toss everything else into.
It is -- it's basically every kind of music based off of the music American slaves sang to keep themselves sane. Up until pretty recently, in Europe it was all called "black music".
Yikes. Wasn't expecting a deep dive like this.
Well, you can't really avoid it. It's all about the class and race divide.
There is a sort of snootiness to the name. This is, ugh, popular music -- for the proles.
It's a euphemism. Everything about pop music is a euphemism, just like everything about white culture is about hiding our shame over our crimes.
Yee yimminy yikes. Let's dial it back, okay?
I'm just being honest here. You know how "dangerous" it was in the 1950s for nice young white girls to dance to that rock and roll music.
Well, that was a generational thing.
It's all about fear of black men having sex with white women. Rock and roll was at the time black slang for sex, just as jazz was a generation earlier.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of all these kid stars becoming pop stars?
I think some of them have some real talent.
And the others?
Some others confuse me as to why any one would want o listen to them.
I feel that way about Miley Cyrus.
I can not fathom why people enjoy her songs.
Her Dead Pets album was free, but really not worth the space.
I just think all of her songs sound off key.
Like her rendition of Joelene, not great.
I did not like her song, Party in the USA, it was just dumb.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go to a show so bad
What sort of show
A pop music show duh
Why
They look so fun
Have you ever been
Nope not had a chance
Well maybe we can go together
Maybe
I can look up some tickets if you want
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you like Bruno Mars?
He is not that bad.
I think he has a eclectic personality.
I loved the song just the way you are.
It was a hit
His performance at the Super Bowl was awesome
Yeah he rocked it.
Plus he is also a producer too
He wrote a ton of hits for other artists.
He has the presence you need to be successful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever heard of the Backstreet Boys?
Yes, of course.
Do you like them more than N'Sync?
Yes, I do
They have really good songs like I Want it that Way.
Do you like Justin Timberlake?
I am not a big fan
So you prefer Nick Carter?
Yes, he is awesome
Both bands were amazing groups.
XXXXXXXXXXX
is beyonce overrated?
i think she definitely is
people make her out to be a queen
they put her on a pedastol
all these little girls think her music is everything
her new album is pretty good though
its good but still overrated
it got critically acclaimed
both her last albums did
yup
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the pop genre needs saving?
In what respect?
I think that there isnt anyone churning out hit after hit anymore.
Sure there is but with the internet we just hear more about diverse artists
It seems like there is a ton of producers who are now becoming artists
Yeah thats the ebb and flow of the industry
So you think that we will see Katy Perry's song writer eventually come out on their own?
They may have already done so
I never really thought about what else could happen
This is probably one of the biggest conundrum's in the genre
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the last pop song you've heard?
I think it was a The Weeknd song called, "I Feel it Coming".
Oh, really? I'm not sure I've heard that one.
Yeah, I just so happened to see a bit of the music video the other day.
Is it good?
Oh, it's alright. It sounds like every other pop song. He tries too hard to sound like Michael Jackson.
Oh, I think I know who you're talking about now. The guy with the wacky hair?
Yeah, that's him. All his songs sound pretty much the same. So, if you've heard one, you've heard them all.
Well, I guess I won't be checking that song out.
I wouldn't bother. It's not unpleasant like some songs on the radio. It's mediocre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Bruno Mars performance last night?
What channel was it on
BET, it was their awards show.
I must have missed it, how was it.
You know, like every one of his performances.
So it was good, huh?
Yeah he stole the show to be honest.
I wish he could perform at a funeral.
Thats strange.
He just brings so much energy to whatever he does
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Selena Gomez's new single?
Bad Liar? I really like it. It gets stuck in my head all day.
Yes, I wonder if she wrote it about Justin Bieber.
Speaking of Bieber, I love his new song with Daddy Yankee "Despacito"!
Oh me too, who knew he could speak Spanish?
I think that is one of my favorite songs on the radio right now. Along with Halsey's song "Now or Never."
Yes, she has such a beautiful voice.
I always get her voice confused with Alessia Cara, to me they sound very similar.
I saw Alessia Cara perform on the voice and loved it!
I saw that too, she sang "Scars" and was amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the very first concert you went to?
Oh yes!  I went to see the GoGos perform at a small college in Illinois. I think I was about 18 at the time?
I like some of their songs and videos Were they good in concert?
Yeah, they were pretty good.  My friends and I had a really good time.  What about you?  What was your first concert?
I got to see Paul Young perform at Duke University.  He and his band put on an awesome show.
Paul Young?  I think I remember him.  He sang "Every Time You Go Away", right?
Yes, that's one of his hits.  Do you remember "Band-Aid"?  He was the very first singer.
I do remember that.  So, was his show your favorite concert?
No, it was really good but, not my favorite.  My favorite was seeing Yes at the Dean Dome in Chapel Hill.  They were fanatastic.
I like their music but, have never seen them in concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know Demi Lovato?
I do! She is a great singer.
I listen to her song "Confident" all of the time.
That song is great. It's super motivational.
That's why I like it so much! It really pumps me up.
I also like her song "Kingdom Come." It inspires me a lot too.
I don't listen to that one very often. But I definitely like it.
The two songs sound very similar. I thought you might.
I can't wait for her new album. I hope it has a song that sounds like "Confident"
I hope so too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to much pop music
It's kind of a guilty pleasure. Lots of Top 40
Do you like Justin Bieber then?
I really liked Sorry actually. Really catchy.
Where do you listen
On my phone mostly, I follow the charts
So you like The Chainsmokers?
I do and Bruno Mars and Katy Perry
I'm a little partial to Beyonce
Most people are but I prefer Rihanna
XXXXXXXXXXX
Katy Perry is such a good pop singer.
She is. She has cute videos too.
Like the one for California Girls.
Yes. I really like her song Firework.
That is a good one.
So many companies have used her song for ads and even in arenas.
I know. It is catchy.
She does a lot for health organizations.
I know. Did you see she supported Clinton too.
I know. She is a great artist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Michael Jacson has to be the best pop performer ever.
Yeah Thriller was such a great song
Not just that he has all those albums.
Thriller specifically though was so good
The video he made for it was awesome
And this was in the early 80s!
Yeah so he was transcendent.
The video matched up perfectly with the music.
He also had some other hits
Yeah but thats probably the one everyone remembers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sting has a real knack for songwriting.
He used to be an english teacher.
Really, I didn't know that.
His Fields of Gold album was the best.
He has spent alot of his social capital on helping social causes.
Yes, he has done alot of concerts along that line.
What's your favorite Sting song?
I would say Russians.
That's kind of an odd choice.
Yes, but I really like the melody.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just got a Spotify account. Can you recommend some new artists for me?
Sure, I'm really into Ed Sheeran these days.
What does he sing? His name sounds familiar.
He sings Shape of You, Thinking out loud, Castle on the Hill.
I think I've heard of him before.
Yes, he used to be good friends with Taylor Swift.
Oh I love Taylor Swift. Her album "Red" is one of my favorites.
What a coincidnece. Ed was feautred on that album.
I'll definitely have to look him up. What album do you reccomend?
My favorite is x but his newest is divide.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard Miley Cyrus is going to be on The Voice this fall- I think she's a great coach.
I know, if you're going to have someone advising you, you would want someone sweet and supportive like her.
The judges are Blake and Adam again, Miley, and Jennifer Hudson. Blake always wants all the country acts, so I hope Miley takes on pop singers and helps them stand out.
Well, if there's one thing Miley knows how to do, it's stand out.
I doubt she'd do anything like have them appear naked on a wrecking ball, but I hope she would have them be more adventurous with their costumes.
I know what you mean, sometimes singers all seem so alike, it's hard to remember them.
Miley is really versatile, she's a great country singer, but also a pop music superstar. Maybe she could help her people learn to be more versatile in their music choices.
I'm sure she would have some great suggestions on songs. She knows what appeals to people.
I'm going to miss Gwen Stefani though, her and Blake were cute together.
Some people thought TOO cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you hard that new Iggy Azalea song?
Yeah, it's okay. She's been kind of bad of late.
Yeah she hasn't had much success with the last few singles.
Do you think her star is fading?
Maybe, we'll have to see. I think maybe people are just sick of her.
Nicki Minaj is still doing well, so it isn't a female rap thing.
I think it's because Iggy isn't authentic. People can tell.
Nicki is authentic at least. You're right, Iggy's Australian isn't she?
Yeah, but she raps with an American accent.
It's kind of cringey when you think about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know a lot about Sia?
I don't. But I love her song "Unstoppable."
Did you know that she was a popular songwriter before she was famous?
I did not! What did she write?
She wrote "Diamonds" actually
Is that the Rihanna song?
It is! Isn't it a beautiful song?
It really is. I had no idea Sia wrote it.
It's true. Not only is she a great singer, but she is a great songwriter too.
That is probably why songs like Unstoppable are so catchy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate pop music. Its thin, it's simple, it's flavorless.
It's supposed to be like that. The Beatles started out making pop. So did Madonna.
Yeah, they made it to be accessible. So nobody would be offended, and usually everybody would dance.
Or sing along, in their car, in the shower, wherever. What's wrong with that?
It's built out of lightweight ideas that anyone can grasp, that are not specific to anyone's life or ideas. It's generic.
It's not generic, it's universal. It brings people together, the way songs of praise do in a house of worship.
And it's made to be shocking, in a manipulative way, with sex or swearing or violence. Without provoking real thought or feeling.
I disagree. Love songs hit us where we live, and so many pop tunes deal with breaking away, becoming ourselves.
Becoming ourselves crowded in one of those giant stadiums, where the spectacle dazzles us, but nothing really happens.
A lot happens to me, I'll tell you. I love pop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think there has been a lot of one hit wonders in pop music.
You mean like Come On Eileen?
That's a really good example.
I think another good one was Tainted Love.
That one I don't know. I happen to like I'm Too Sexy.
That is a funny song. I loved the video for it.
What do you think of Don't Worry Be Happy.
That is a total chill song.
Another favorite of mine is Turning Japanese.
I don't think I've heard that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to Britney Spears?
I dont know is she still around?
I am asking you!
She was performing in Vegas!
Thats crazy she was on top of the world.
Yeah she had some problems.
I loved hit me baby one more time
she had so many hits for awhile
stronger was great
toxic is my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite singer right now?
Hmmm... I'd say I really like Adele.
Oooo. I like her, too.
She's got a great voice and seems so down to earth.
I like her because her songs from the first album are still relevant.
Absolutely.  I'd listen to the first album anytime.
I wonder when she'll have her next album come out.
Not sure.  I haven't heard anything about it.
Well, I would be excited to hear it.
Me, too.  We'll be Rollin' in the Deep while we wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best Pop Music performer?
Well, besides all the controversy I think Micahel Jackson.
Yes, he had so many great songs.
I loved Thriller.
That was good and the video was amazing.
Billy Jean was great too.
There were so many fantastic songs from him.
The Way You Make Me Feel is another favorite of mine.
We could go on for hours.
Yeah we could. way too many to pick from.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Wham?
I still do
Cool
I have some of their CD's
Do you like their singer?
He has a good voice
What song do you like?
I like Jitterbug and Last Christmas
Isn't it called Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best pop group of all time?
No question. It is Duran Duran. You?
I do like them but I prefer Britney Spears.
She is so good!
What kind of new pop music do you like?
I love Harry Styles and One Direction. What about you?
One Direction were great! I hope they reunite.
I do, too.
Do you like other boy bands?
I used to love N' Sync.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Taylor Swift?
I'll listen to her, but I'm not really a fan.
Oh, my daughter loves her.
I think everyone's daughter loves her.
She's actually not that bad of a role model.
No, not compared to a lot of the other female singers.
Her songs are extremely catchy, too.
Oh, I feel you on that.  I feel like I'm too old to be singing them.
But they are so catchy and fun!
Hey, that's why the kids love her!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any of Taylor Swift's music?
Oh I love her song "Shake it Off!"
Oh yes that is my ultimate fave!
I would listen to it over and over when it first came out.
I did that too. Then I started to get tired of it.
Do you know who Alessia Cara is?
I do! I especially like her song "Scars to Your Beautiful."
I love it! I think it is a great message for young girls.
I totally agree with you.
Young girls needs to hear those kind of lyrics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You have any favorite,pop,songs right now?
Yes,I've got a few.
What are they?
Shape of you by Ed Sheeran.
That's a good one.
Closer by The Chainsmokers.
I like that one myself.
Malibu by Miley Cyrus.
I like Miley.
She's got a good voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like a few songs by the Weeknd, do you know who that is?
I think so, doesn't he have kind of weird hair.
Yes he does! Looks like dreads but standing up.
Oh okay then yes I know that guy. Pretty good music!
I kind of like the song "Starboy."
I really like that one too! Too much cursing so I can't listen to it around my kids though.
Yea you're right. It was a great song though.
He has a very good voice, I enjoy it.
I really do also!
I would say the Weeknd's music is a top fave.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the biggest pop star in music history?
Definitely has to be Michael Jackson.
Why do you say Michael Jackson instead of Madonna?
I think Michael Jackson had a larger following.
Between Michael Jackson and Madonna, who do you think sold more records?
Definitely Michael Jackson, I'm guessing he sold twice as many records as Madonna.
Did you know that they were both inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame?
Yes, but I don't know why. They were both pop stars.
I'm guessing it's because they influenced a lot of rock artists.
Yeah, Michael Jackson did influence a lot of artists in different genres. Artists like Sheryl Crow, Green Day and Justin Bieber would probably list him as a big influence.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Madonna?
Yes, I think she is one of the best pop artists.
What song do you like of hers?
Live to Tell
I like Crazy for You
That is a good one too.
Do you like her newer stuff?
I prefer the older stuff
How long have you been listening to her?
Since the 90's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What songs do you like of Madonna's work?
Madonna, wow she played so much over the years.
Yes, I like her song, Just Like a Prayer, that is a legend of a song.
Madonna is a queen of pop. I think I like Vogue and Express Yourself.
I really like her album Ray of Light in 2008.
That album has some classics on it, Frozen is a great song on that album.
Who produced that album?
Madonna, and William Orbit produced it.
She is fantastic!
I can't wait to see her live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any good new songs lately?
I like pretty much anything by the Chainsmokers right now.
I do kind of like the song they have with Coldplay. I think it's called Something Just Like This.
I like that one too! They play it a lot though on the radio.
I agree!  They play the same songs over and over on the radio.
I got tired of hearing Closer, the one featuring Halsey.
Me too!  It was played like every other song on the radio.
I kind of think that all of the songs by the Chainsmokers sound a lot alike.
I never noticed that before but I guess you are kind of right.
I might start listening to more Adele or something just to get something different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have recently gotten into pop music.
Oh yea, like what?
I am a fan of Taylor Swift, her pop stuff.
She does really good songs. Her song Bad Blood was so good.
That is the one that got me into her. I like the beat of her songs.
She writes most her lyrics as well.
I just learned that, did you know she wrote some stuff for a few country singers?
The "Better Man Song", I knew that.
Well she did. I like her song "Style" too.
I think that was about Harry Styles, most her songs are about love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Miley Cyrus is one of my favorites Pop Music Stars
What is one of your favorite Miley Cyrus songs?
Racking Ball is one of my favorite songs
She such a great inspiration to all!
Yes, she support all especially, LGBT's and homeless
Do you know her godmother is Dolly Parton
Yes. She and Dolly did a remake of Jolene have you heard it
I watched them on the Voice.
She is such an awesome performer
I am waiting on her to drop another CD
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop superstar?
If I had to pick, I would go with Micheal Jackson as his music is classic.
I can not really argue with that, I love thriller as it is such a great song to dance to.
I love thriller but Smooth criminal is my favorite song by Micheal Jackson.
Did you know that Micheal Jackson had his first solo hit when he was just 13 with the song "Got to Be There,"?
No I did not know that, though I do like his work with the Jackson five.
Yeah my favorite song of theirs is ABC.
You could certainly see one Micheal Jackson's talents even then.
Especially dancing and singing in his first complete of songs with the group.
Exactly, that he would go onto to make some of the most famous songs and dances (thriller and the moon walk). May he rest in peace, he will be missed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What pop music do you like?
I like maroon 5.
I like maroon 5 too.
I like the old stuff though.
Oh really?
Yeah I love the album songs about jane.
Yeah that album is great. I also like the new stuff too.
What song?
One more night.
Oh maybe I should give that another shot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, do I hate Justin Bieber?
Doesn't everyone?
Of course not.  There's a whole slew of Beliebiers out there.
I don't get why.  He's not a good role model.
To say the least.  He's a punk.
And his music is not that good.  It's all helped by a machine.
Was he really that talented or just a Youtube sensation?
He wasn't better than anyone else on Youtube, but he looked good and that's all that mattered.
I wish I was talented.
And good looking - burn!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did country music become pop music?
That's a good question! It's a bit strange that artists like Taylor Swift have become so huge.
Yes, I agree. Why has this phenomena occurred?
In the 1950s, the "Nashville Sound" tried to dampen down country music a bit.
How did they do that?
Well, the "Honkey Tonk" of the 1940s was too raw to become popular. So, the smoothed everything out.
And, that worked well enough to turn country music into pop music.
It did! And, I think you see that same pattern today.
What do you mean?
Well, Taylor Swift was a lot more country music when she started. And, she's gradually become more and more pop music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite kind of music?
I really like all types.
Then what do you listen to the most?
I think I listen to pop the most.
That is my favorite kind of music. Who is your favorite artist?
That is tough. You go first.
I think my favorite group is Maroon 5.
They are good. I like when Adam Levine does solo things as well.
Well, what is your favorite?
I guess I will go with Maroon 5 as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk music, who is your favorite popstar/band?
Taylor swift is definitely my favorite as I like her energy and style.
I did Enjoy her 1989 album.
That is a great album, and my favorite song of hers is from that album (Shake it off).
It is a good album, but my favorite is wildest dreams.
Also a good song, in truth I like every song on that album.
Sometimes, I still think it is funny she started out as a country music artist.
I still enjoy her earlier work despite it being of another genre.
I agree it is still good music, i just believe she grew as an artist when she transitioned to pop.
She definitely branched out but most of her music still retains that sole that makes it unique to her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
mac miller writes pretty good music
eh, not really. is it even pop music?
i think so. i definitely wouldn't consider him rap, no matter how hard he tries.
haha, wow. that's pretty harsh.
weekend is a good song or whatever, but it's obviously a pop song
it is pretty poppin
not like white guys should be rapping anyway you know?
you're right
imagine, he could be so good if he went in more of a pop direction
i think he's poppy enough as is
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like Twenty One Pilots.
I don't know much about them.
They're really good.  There are two guys in the band.
What kind of music is it?
It's hard to describe.  It's kind of alternative, but pop.  Sometimes they rap.
I don't really like rap music.
It's not rap music.  It's just sometimes they rap in it.
So, there is music, other lyrics and stuff in the songs?
Yes.  It's not rap music.
OK.  I'll listen to them and see if I like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Katy Perry is so beautiful!
She is! She is like the perfect person to be a pop star!
Do you listen to her music?
Yes I do!
What's your favorite song by Katy?
I'm really into "Roar".
Yeah, that's a pretty cool one. Katy is cool period!
I'd like to see her and Ariana Grande make a song together.
Heck yes, me too! Ari would make a perfect duo with Katy!
They're both the queens of pop at the moment!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to much Shakira?
I used to, but not lately.
She has a new song, it is as great as any of her old songs.
What is the name?
It is called Me Enamore.
Ok I will have to listen to it.
It is a true jam, it is energizing and relaxing at the same time.
Wow that is an interesting combination.
Yes it is a unique song that sounds so good and is exciting and energizing as well.
I will check it out, thank you for mentioning it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The 2017 BET Awards are about to begin tonight. Who are you looking forward in seeing?
I like to see Beyonce. She is very talented.
I'm not sure if you heard "Sorry". Its a very good song.
I heard that one and its really good song to listen to and especially while driving.
I feel that she sounds even better on stange than on the radio.
I couldn't agree with you more.
She does have a lot of songs under her belt.
I agree. I also like the song "lemonade".
That is a very cool song.
Yes it is. Very catchy and I'm sure fans of hers would love that particular song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose your favorite pop artist?
I love brittney spears!
Yes she is awesome, i really love the way she goes out of the box with her performances
Yes i loved her MTV music award performances
Do you know if she still performs?
I know she was headlining in vegas im not sure if she still is though
Oh i see, my favorite song from her would have to be "im a slave for you"
Yes its such a catchy song too
I think that was the song she came out with a live snake at the MTV awards
Oh yes that was very scary! She so brave for that performance
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite pop singer?
Hands down Brittany Spears?
Why is that?
Because she was a good singer and fit the description of a pop singer.
I think she was good but there are so many to choose from you know?
Yeah i know what you mean.
The backstreet boys or Nsync?
Come on now hands down Nsync?
Yeah , Justin was the best in that group.
Yeah he was and easy on the eyes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the pop group "One Direction"?
I am not, but I do like the solo stuff.
Did you hear Harry Style new song?
He has a few, maybe "Sign of the Times"?
That is it! It was amazing, so well written.
I think so too. It was a really well structured song.
When I heard it, it reminded me of like Beatles pop music.
That pop feel, but deep meaning?
Yes! His new solo stuff is so deep, but also fun to listen too.
I think he is going to do well on his own, his new pop stuff is very good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like better, Brittney Spears or Iggy Azalea?
Oh come on, hit me baby one more time! Brittney!
Do I get a hint from your age based on that response?
Please! Name five songs by Iggy right now.  Quick!
Uh, welll, okay name 5 songs by Brittney.
Woops, I did it again.  If you seek Amy. My progetive. Hit me baby one more time. Lucky.
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend?  Fail!
No, no, that one about a girl names Lucky who is famous but lonely?
Oh, yeah.  I just googled it.
And Britney has her own Vegas show. Drop the mike!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, pop music in the 80s was really good.
Oh, I know. Prince is one of my favorite artists.
He was one of the best, especially his album Purple Rain.
I love that album! "When Doves Cry" is one of the best songs ever.
Yeah, I really like that one. I also like the title track.
Oh, of course! "Purple Rain" is a beautiful song.
What about his later stuff? Are you into that?
Very much so. He did a song about 10 years ago called "Guitar" that I couldn't get enough of.
Really?
Yeah, you should check it out sometime!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard a funny story about Justin Bieber.
That wouldn't be surprising, there's probably LOTS of those!
He was singing at a festival a couple weeks ago and someone asked him to sing the Spanish song he collaborated on, Despacito.
What was he doing, lip synching?
No, he couldn't even do that. He refused to sing it, and admitted to the crowd he didn't even know the lyrics.
That would be funny!
One of the fans apparently didn't think so- they threw a water bottle and almost hit him in the head.
Did he get mad and storm off the stage?
No, he was actually calm and asked them not to throw things at him.
I kind of feel for him, because I took Spanish in school, and I couldn't learn much except a few words.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Circus is my favorite Britney Spears album.
I really like that one.
My favorite song on it is Womanizer.
My favorite is Blur.
That song is really underrated.
I know. It deserves so much more credit.
What did you think of her album Blackout?
I absolutely loved it.
Me too. Piece of Me is still one of my favorite songs.
Mine too. I could listen to that album all day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went to go see a Lifehouse concert when I was 14, do you remember them?
I do! I loved their music.
3 Doors Down was also there at their concert.
I remember their song "Kryptonite".
Also a fave of mine! You don't hear songs like that no.
You really don't! I enjoyed their music.
I did too.  I actually downloaded that song on my phone last month.
Do you remember the name of the lead singer in 3 Doors Down?
I'm not sure but I know it's something familiar, let me think.
Was it Brad Arnold I think?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about pop music, what is your favorite current hit?
I am liking anything by Bebe Rexha right now.
Oh yeah, i like her too.
I feel pop music is more diversified now than it used to be.
What do you mean by that?
I mean there are so many artists and styles that it is hard to keep up with all of them.
Yeah I see what you mean, it used to be you would hear the same old song over and over again on the radio.
Do you ever go to concerts?
Yes there is an event in my town every year called Firefly where bands play all weekend.
That sounds fun, I would love to go to something like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Katy Perry's music?
Yep, I love it.
Me too. What's your favorite song by her?
My favorite song by her is Roar.
Every time I hear that song I feel so powerful.
Me too. What's your favorite Katy Perry song?
It would probably have to be E.T.
I really like that one, too.
Did you ever watch the music video for it?
Yes, I thought it was amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Name one of your favorite boy bands.
Hanson
Oh, I remember them. They were the 3 brothers right?
Yes, and they played that mmbop song.
yeah, I loved that one. I miss boy bands like them.
Yeah, N'Sync and Backstreet Boys were others.
They were awesome too.
I wish they were still around. They had great songs.
I wonder where they all went?
They probably retired
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite pop song right now?
Hmm. I would have to go with anything by Justin Bieber.
I love him too! I love the song The Only One by him right now.
Me too! It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with.
Pop music in general is always fun to dance and sing along with.
I agree. I love playing pop music in the car because of that very reason.
Any other pop music you are loving right now?
Yeah, I really like That's What I Like by Bruno Mars.
Aah! Me too. That song always has me dancing!
Anything Bruno Mars sings has me dancing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Ed Sheeran?

Hey  Y'all, Whose your favorite Pop Star?
I LOVE RIHANNA'S "BITCH BETTER HAVE MY MONEY
I like all of her sounds, she fantastic
Yes, she is and she does a great job collaborating with others
For sure. Every soundtracks she's been on has been a hit, like Jay Z, Umbrella
She did a great job with Eminem, "Love the Way You Lie"
The lyrics was great and the beats were deep
Do you know Rihanna was recognized as the 2017 Harvard's Humanitarian of the year
That's fantastic, what charities do she support?
It's the Clara and Lionel Foundation scholarship to support effective education and health programs around the world
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the song Irreplaceable by Beyonce was originally meant for Shania Twain?
What?! How is that possible?
Ne-Yo wrote the song and said he originally wanted it to be a country song.
I can't even imagine it as one.
He said he had Faith Hill or Shania Twain in mind as he was writing it.
That seems pretty crazy.
Beyonce did a great job with it though, I am glad she was the one who performed it.
Me too, but now I kind of wish someone would record a country version of it.
Maybe there is one on Youtube.
I'm sure there is one somewhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who to you most admire Mylie Cyrus, Selena Gomez, or Taylor Swift?
You mean the young queens of pop music?
Yes, they are current leaders. They have replaced Madonna, Brittany Spears, and Katy Perry.
That's an interesting progression!
Well, that's the nature of pop music. They only love you for a short time, and then they move on.
That's kind of sad.
I don't know. They being a pop music star pays well.
That's true. Anyway, I most admire Taylor Swift.
How come?
She seems to have been the best at handlng the stress of being a pop music star.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Justin Bieber's music?
Some of the newer songs are okay.
Have you heard his album "Purpose"?
I think I have heard a few songs off of it.
I love it. Skrillex helped make some of the songs on it.
Is that the one with "Sorry" on it?
Yeah, it also has "What Do You Mean".
I know that song. It's going to get stuck in my head now.
There's also a song called "I'll Show You". It has the best beat on the whole album.
I don't think I know that one. I'll check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to pop music?
Sometimes when I want to dance.
Who is your favorite pop artist?
I think everyone's favorite is Britney Spears.
I know she is one of my favorites.
I used to listen to the pop boy bands when they were popular as well.
I think everyone listened to boy bands.  They aren't around so much anymore.
Pop music changes so frequently that it is no surprise they aren't around.
It really does change constantly.
The artists come and go all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite song is BEAUTY AND THE BEAT.
It is by Justin Beiber.
I like when they dance in the wading pool.
Water is splashing everywhere.
I can feel your body rock.
Girl I can feel your body rock.
I like it when he does, eh, eh, eh.
His underwater part is cool.
They underwater phones are cool also.
I think they are cameras.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like Elton John is the top pop performer of the 70s.
You could almost say the 80s too!
I think that goes to Madonna.
OK so round it out, how about the 90s?
That was a boy band era, so N Sync.
No Backstreet Boy love, huh?
No I just dont think they were as good as N Sync.
How did you feel about R Kelly?
He was pop, but didnt have the influence of the boy bands.
Yeah but I think he left a mark for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you agree that  Michael Jackson was the king of pop?
Yes 100% he was the king of pop.
So my question is who is the queen of pop then?
Hard to say if there is one, he kind of created pop in a way. Not sure any females made the same impact on the music world.
No one can or will ever be as  great an influence on pop music. But who would you crown?
Maybe Taylor Swift. She always is winning lots of awards.
But her start was in country. I don't think she should be queen of pop.
Well Michael started with his brothers in Motown and became King of pop.
That is a good point you make. Maybe she could deserve the title then... but I say lady gaga is a better choice.
I had not consider GAGA.She may be more of a pop princess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is U2 a pop group?
I think so
I thought they were more rock.
They are more pop than anything
I guess a rock band can be a pop band too.
I think The Beatles were a pop band at first.
Really?
Yes
But, not later on right?
Not when they became studio musicians.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any of Justin Bieber's music?
I like some of his songs actually.
Oh really which ones?
I like the song "I'm the One" that he sang with DJ Khaled recently.
Yes I play that one over and over in my car.
I also like the song "Let me Love you."
Also a favorite of mine! His music is pretty good actually.
I like the sound of his voice, he could sing to me any day.
I don't know why some people act like he doesn't have good music.
They're probably just tired of the hype of his music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what new pop music have you been listening to?
Miley Cyrus has a good song that came out pretty recently. I think it is called "Malibu."
I like that one too but I think my favorite new song is "Something Just Like This" with The Chainsmokers and Coldplay.
That is a great song but nothing will ever be better than The Chainsmokers 'Selfie!"
That was a great song. I think some of the greatest pop music came from the 90s.
You're right, I'll never forget Will Smith and "Miami."
What about Aqua and "Barbiegirl" and let's not ever forget about Sir MixaLot.
Baby Got Back, I'll never forget dancing to that when the parents were away. There was such a huge obsession with Savage Garden and Celine Dion too.
Yes, "My Heart Will Go On" was everyone's favorite song for a while after Titanic. "Peaches" was another favorite that was just huge for a while.
I wish we had something comparable now to what "Peaches" was then. There is some great pop music being made but "Peaches" was iconic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite artist?
I just love Adele!
What is your favorite song to dance to?
That would have to be "Happy". That song just makes me want to move!
What artist do you not like?
I can't stand anything by Taylor Swift.
What was the last concert you attended?
Miley Cirus. She is just so fun in concert.
Who would you want to serenade you?
I would just die to have One Direction serenade me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Britney Spears?
Yes, I loved her music
She had some great hits in the 90's
Yeah she did. I like Baby One More Time
That is a classic
I wish she was still making hits
Same here and the Spice Girls
I love them so much.
Who is your favorite Spice Girl?
Baby Spice

me too, those songs remind me of my teenagerhood, such a beautiful and struggling memory
why struggling?
well, when you were a teenager you had a lot of think about, emotionally.

Yes, and she has won so many awards in almost every category

That's what you call a very creative person, who knows how to create, produce and sale
XXXXXXXXXXX

No it was a variety show.

Lionel Richie and Diana Ross, "Endless Love."

Deniece Williams and Johnny Mathis, "Too Much Too Little."

I can't remember. It's been at least four years.
I really enjoy her music. I wish she would release another album soon.
Yeah. The last big hit I can remember of hers was Candyman.
I know, and that song came out so long ago.
She has probably just been busy with other projects.
You're right. She was working on The Voice for a few years.
I also heard she was offering singing lessons through an online course.
Really? Wow!
Yep. She definitely has the industry experience to teach people.

So let's play a game. Best pop male vocalist right now, go!
That is simple. Adam Levine.
Adam Levine? The absolute best is Adam Levine?
What is wrong with Adam Levine? He is so talented!
He is great, don't get me wrong. But he has a band to back him up.
Well who would you suggest?
Bruno Mars, he is the only vocalist so you know all that talent is him.
I do love Bruno Mars, but I don't think Adam Levine being part of a band has any impact.
I guess we just disagree.
Have you listened to Adam Levine's solo stuff? Try that and I know we will agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Yes I do! Also a great one. I listen to it often.
I do also. It has great lyrics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Queen. They are timeless.
Yeah, they are. Freddie Mercury's voice is amazing. No one can hit those notes like him.
I know it was so sad to loose such a great voice to the world.
It was. He was so creative and theatrical in his performances.
I know they talk about the crowds that would show up for the shows and it was just crazy.
They had so many great song that were so completely different.
Yeah, how do you go from Bohemian Rhapsody to We are the Champions?
That is every sport fans favorite song, no doubt.
That's because "We Will Rock You!"
Ha! Rock on Freddie, you will be missed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember back when Jessica Simpson was popular?
Yes I do! I liked her music.
Wasn't she related to someone from 98 degrees?
She was married to one of the singers.
Do you remember which one it was?
Yes it was Nick Lachey.
Oh that's right! I remember now.
I also really liked 98 degrees.
Yes they had pretty good songs.
They weren't as popular as bands like Nsync though.
XXXXXXXXXXX

No one else will go with me! I have asked everyone.
Well, who do you plan on seeing?
Kelly Clarkson! You know she is my favorite artist!
Isn't she the girl that won American Idol?
Yup. She has a really good voice. I think you will have fun.
If I go to the concert you can buy my ticket. I am not paying money to attend a pop concert.
You have yourself a deal! You will love her Slid Shady cover by Eminem.
I am already regretting my decision!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think my all time favorite band from the 90's was the Backstreet Boys. Were you a fan?
Of course I was! They were the best!
Which was your favorite song of theirs?
I think it was "As Long As You Love Me."
Yes that was a great one!
I also really that one song where they dressed up in costumes in the music video.
You mean the song "Everybody"?
Yes I think that's the one.
Nick Carter used to be so cute.
Yes he was my definite favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Dave Clark Five was one of my favorite bands.
I liked the Beatles better.
Did you know their song Glad All Over knocked off I Want to Hold Your Hand in the UK?
Really.  What was the name of their movie?
Catch Us if You Can, or Having a Wild Weekend in the USA.
Not as big hit as A Hard Day's Night.
Not at all.
What was their last big US hit?
You've Got What It Takes, 1967.
They pretty vanished after that.
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey is that the new "Katy Perry" song I just heard you playing?
Yes it is
Sounds a lot different from what she usually does
Yeah she decided to try a different approach to her sound this time
Reminds me a lot of "Lady Gaga"
You know what I actually can agree with that sounds very similar
I kind of liked her other hits like "California Girls"
That was a great summer anthem
I know we just had it cranking out at the pool yesterday
Speaking of which you need to have me over sometime to take a dip
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite live pop performer?
That's tough, but Lady Gaga always puts on a great show.
Did you see her Super Bowl performance?
Yeah, I thought it was good but not as spectacular as I expected.
Me too. What is your favorite halftime performance of recently?
I think Beyonce's was probably the best. I still remember it and it was years ago.
And they brought her back for last year's too didn't they?
With Bruno Mars and Coldplay? Yes, they did.
Beyonce is a once in a generation performer, though.
Her vocals live are exactly like the record. She's so talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Donny Osmond is my wife's favorite singer.
Isn't he as old as the hills?

Puppy Love.
Right.
She used to watch him on The Andy Williams Show.
What is he doing now?
He released an album, The Soundtrack of My Life.
Nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the new stuff by Lady Gaga?
I do not like the sort of added country feel to some of the songs.
The one about the mirror you mean?
Yes, it was not pop enough for her. She is a pop star not a country one.
I like the change of pace of her stuff.
It may be a change, but I like her older stuff.
What is her best song in your opinion?
I would have to say Poker Face.
Good dance song, I do not think it is her best.
I like that is had meaning, but was also just there, all pop and all happy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Like any global pop music artists?
Kylie Minogue, for one.
Yeah she's very popular internationally.
Her music in general is catchy.
She does some dance music too.
She has a playful artistic persona.
She's sold a lot of pop music globally.
Is she still performing?
I'm not sure now. She was acting for a bit.
Well I hope she puts out another album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So basically I am like obsessed with Ed Sheeran at the moment.
I can understand why, he is pretty awesome.
His songs are so meaningful and he has great catchy melodies.
He also writes stuff for other people too.
I know!  Did you know he helped write Love Yourself for Justin Beiber?
I think he even sings on the track too!
That is so cool!  I loved the song Everything Has Changed that he sang and wrote with Taylor Swift.
The music video for that song was so cute!
He seems like he is pretty funny and down to earth in real life too.
Yeah I saw him on a talk show once and it was hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am trying to come up with something catchy
It is not  that hard to do
Well then why am i  having trouble
Because you need practice
Well duh
Why do you want one anyways
I want to make a pop song
Pop songs need more than a catchy beat
Nuh uh
Yes huh
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any streams from Glastonbury?
Yeah, I just watched Katy Perry's set.
What it any good?
I thought she did a really good job, yeah.
Better than you expected?
Far better. She did the whole show live!
Did she just sing the hits?
No, she also performed stuff from Witness.
I haven't even purchased Witness yet.
Neither have I, but I might now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
katy perry or taylor swift?
i'm more for katy's side.
taylor is just so petty
taylor has better music though.
new romantics is my favorite.
her new album killed it
she completely branched over to the pop side.
the dark side of music.
she was never that country though.
that is true
XXXXXXXXXXX
My co-worker's favorite singer is Diana Ross.
I'm way too young to remember her.  What was her first group?
The Supremes.
I hear them on Spotify.  What were some of their hits?
"Where Did Our Love Go" and "Forever Came Today" .
When did she go solo?
1970, Diana Ross album.

Lady Sings the Blues, Mahogany, and The Wiz.
I might watch one of those.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like pop music?
Yeah I do. My musical tastes are pretty eclectic.
So to you, who is the reigning king of pop music?
It's still gotta be Michael Jackson.
I can understand that. I still really enjoy his music.
Me too. Forever Michael!
Then who is the Queen of Pop for you?
Well Madonna naturally!  I think the mass media still sees it this way too.
Yeah I think that's right. The reigning King and Queen.
Michael Jackson will be in our hearts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to know who your favorite female pop star is!
My favorite is Madonna.
Awesome choice.
She has so many good songs that it's hard to pick favorites.
Do you have a favorite though? Mine is Like A Prayer.
I liked the gospel singers in the music video for it.
Me too. It was a nice touch.
Her live performances are so good!
She is a great performer.
I hope to see her live one day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how do you like the chainsmokers?
i hate them to be honest.
how come?
because they are not original and they have no substance.
they are overplayed, especially closer
i like halsey though
she has a good voice
she does, it is very sensual
yeah. she sings well
the dude from chainsmokers doesnt though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that one song from way back, I think it was "Barbie Girl"?
Yes! My friends and I would dance to that song all the time.
Who sang it? Do you remember?
Yes it was a band named Aqua.
Oh okay that does sound familiar.
I just feel like the music back in the 90's was the best.
I completely agree. Some were one hit wonders though.
You mean like Vanilla Ice?
Oh yes him of course! I loved his one song though.
Yes! "Ice Ice Baby!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do we have to listen to pop? I hate all this auto tune.
So do I actually.
I feel like the artists should be able to sing without it or just don't bother.
Right. It wasn't always a thing so they obviously could at one point.
It would make music so much more believable. Now pop is a joke.
It kind of is. Everyone knows it's more about looks.
Yep, pritty girls and hot guys get to be stars even with zero talent.
I haven't liked pop since the 90's.
They weren't really using auto tune then. It just started being a thing.
It became rampant right around 2000.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Adele?
I kind of don't care for her.
Why not?  She's a great singer.
Oh, she's good.  Her music is just boring.
She has so much emotion in her music though.
I think she does, but it's just not for me.
I guess we all have our opinion.
Don't get me wrong though, she deserves all her awards.
You wouldn't buy her album though.
Nope.  Not me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i miss that one artist
Which one
The guy with the smooth voice in the late 2000s
You can be talking about anyone
I am talking about Ne Yo
Oh yeah he was smooth
His music spoke to me
It was pretty good i must say
Yeah it was like the voice of a generation
I do not quite feel that way though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Carpool Karaoke with Harry Styles?
I think I did.    Who is the host of that show?
That is the show with the British guy, James Corden.
Yes, I saw that.      He left that group, right?
Yes, I think One Direction broke up, although I am not sure.
That doesn't bother me much, I never liked their style.
Yes, they were definitely created and marketed for pre-teen girls.
So what about that new song of Harry Styles solo?
Yes, I saw him doing that.     Catchy and pretty surprising.
Yes, I never really thought any of them could actually play guitar!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Madonna will continue her career?
No I think she is getting too old.
She has spanned almost 4 decades now.
And really since Material Girl what has she done?
She had the breakout song on the Austin Powers soundtrack.
That was even 20 years ago.
I still think Like a Prayer was her best song.
I loved the video.
She was the first controversy before they were big.
So she was just like a Kardashian!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that weird album by Fiona Apple?
Tidal?
No, the really strange album name.
Oh, the super snobby artsy one?
Yeah, that one. The one that didn't succeed.
When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might so When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're Right.
Right, did that succeed at all? That was mean of me.
Spin called it the #100 album of the past 25 years or so. It just didn't get much airplay.
What was the big hit from it?
I think it was Fast as You Can. Hit the top 25.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like about pop music?
It's fun and more upbeat.
I agree. What do you dislike?
Mostly the auto tune and lack of real musical ability.
That's what I dislike too. I hate auto tune.
It makes the singers sound robotic.
A lot of the time it does, yes.
I can always hear it even if it's used sparingly.
I think pop was better before it came along.
I agree. The singers had to go on their own merrits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard THAT'S WHAT I LIKE?
Its by Bruno Mars.
It was released this year 2017.
It got 600 thousand views in 3 months.
I think he is handsome.
He sings great.
He dances great.
I love him.
I like his hair.
I like his clothes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to Halsey's new song?
I have not! Did it just came out?
Where have you been? It has been out for awhile! It's called 'Now or Never.'
Oh sounds like a good song, I'll have to look it up.
What about the One Direction boys? Many of them have their own singles.
I know, they're completely on their own.
I like Harry Styles' new song, 'Sign of the Times,' the lyrics really work for me.
Likewise! It's one of his best yet.
What about Niall Horan? He has some great hits too.
I love his song 'Slow Hands.'  It's so romantic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the current state of pop music
terrible, i don't like any of these new songs
What about The Weeknd, he is doing some cool stuff lately
No, it sounds too generic.
Well what about Drake? His new song Passionfruit is easy to listen to
I'm not really a fan of rap, i love soft rock and accoustic music
Maybe you should check out Ed sheeran
what kind of music does he do
He plays guitar and incorporates a lot of pop in his music
i'll have to check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen SHOW YOU OFF.
It's by Justin Bieber.
Nicki Minaj is in the video also.
It was released in 2013.
It has almost 800 thousand views.
They filmed it at night.
They filmed it at a water park.
It must have been fun to be in that video.
Everyone was happy.
Shot by Justin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My daughter loves Selena Gomez.
Wasn't she on a kids' show?
She was on Barney.
Then a Disney show, right?
Wizards of Waverly Place.
How many albums did she release?
Three with a band, two solo.
I remember Kiss and Tell.
Her solo albums were Stars Dance and Revival.
I hope she keeps singing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Chainsmokers?
I find myself liking some of their songs.
Are you a fan?
I wouldn't say that.  I mean I thought Selfie was stupid.
Oh, I did too.  It was catchy though.
It was.  It was pretty annoying though.
So, do you like Closer?
Yes!  The first time I heard it, I was like "What is that?"
Yeah, it has a great flow.
Yeah, it's pretty chill.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the song sign of the times?
Harry styles right?
Yes on his own though not a one direction song.
I actually heard an amazing version done by a you tube girl.
I often love to find covers.
ya she has done an acapella version. But she does all the parts.
That sounds impressive.
It really is. She improves on an already great song.
What is her name?
Kathleen  Payton. She is so talented. Just search Kathleen Payton Music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think of that new song by The Chainsmokers, "It Won't Kill Ya?"
I love that song, it's so catchy!
I know, it's probably my all time favorite song now!
It would be so cool if we could go to one of their concerts, I wonder when they'll be coming to our state?
I don't know, but I definitely think we should look into it.
I would die to see them live!
What would be the best time for you to go to a concert of theirs? Summer/Fall?
I think that an early Autumn would be a great time to go to the concert.
Alright, it's settled, we're going to see The Chainsmokers this September!
I am so excited, road trip!
