How about that young talent on the sixers?
Yea, but Embiid can't stay healthy.
Oh no, hes healthy and domiant.
Idk but if he isnt the core doesnt look as good.
Not even with Simmons, Saric, and maybe Jackson?
The same Simmons who was hurt his rookie year?
We're talking about potential here. Look at the potential of all of these guys.
What is potential when it doesnt translate to the court.
Look, Embiid and Simmons together isn't appealing to you?
No, it is, but I'll believe it when I see it.
What if we get Lowry. Then will you believe?
I might. That would be a good pickup, but he wants a lot of money.
Hes coming off his best year at age 31. Give him the money.
I guess but dont go crazy.
Add Lowry to that core and you're in the playoffs. No?
I dont know about that, but maybe.
The Eastern Conference is rough.
Yea, its not the strongest.
We'll see how we fare. I wanna see everyone healthy.
Yea, lets see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is going to win the finals?
The Warriors.
Who do you think they  will win over?
The Cavs.
Man that would be a great series.
Yeah, I'm really rooting for that.
Plus it would be the first back to back to back finals in NBA history.
Yeah, I care less about that but it would be fun.
Yeah, Lebron vs Durant would be so good to watch.
Yeah and Kyrie vs Steph.  I can barely wait.
Hopefully everyone stays healthy for that.
Well if the Cavs and Warriors keeps sweeping they will have plenty of rest.
Yeah that should keep them healthy.
Which is better for all fans.
Yeah I wonder if Draymond could do anything to get suspended this year?
It would have to be really terrible because I bet the league does not want that storyline again.
Yeah plenty of people think that the Warriors would have won without his suspension.
I am one of those people.
I could see that.
Yes it totally swung the finals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Lakers and the Cavaliers Wednesday?
Yeah, my cable didn't get the Bulls game so I watched that one.
Did you see Kevin Durant's reverse dunk last night?
Yeah, they should have never let him inside with that much room.
So who do you think will win, the Bulls or the Thunder?
My money's on the Bulls, they've been hot lately.
Did you hear LeBron James may be injured and miss the next couple of games?
Yeah, put I wouldn't count on it.  It's probably just a scam to throw off the Vegas odds makers.
I think this may be the year for the Celtics to remake their dynasty.
Oh, go back to Boston already, it will be a long time before that happens again.
Did you see all the celebrities at the Lakers game?
I saw Jack Nicholson but he's always there.
I heard from somebody that Kevin Curry's not happy and may go free agent.
Not happy?  How many millons does the guy want?
I waiting for the Thunder's next home game.  I'm going to try and get tickets.
Good luck with that, if you do, they'll be nose-bleaders...
I got in a bracket and picker the Pistons to go all the way.
Were you drunk?  They'll never get past Cleveland.
Did you see Westbrook shooting free throws last night?
Yeah, he must have trained with Shaq'  -- many bricks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How was the 76'ers last game?
It was great!
Did you see that last minute shot at the buzzer?
Yeah, that was awesome!
I can't believe they got that last shot in.
I couldn't believe it either.
That was outstanding.
What did you think about all times the 76'ers were fouled?
Yes, the other team was so rough.
I like a lot of action.
Yes, but sometimes they go too far.
Did you see how tall those players were?
Yes, some are over 7 feet tall.
I wouldn't be able to see past them.
That sure helps with the shots.
Yes, it helps with slam dunks.
I wish I could slam dunk.
Yes, the closest I come to a slam dunk is a dunk in a wastebasket.
When do the 76'ers play next?
They are playing next Tuesday at home.  I can't wait to watch them again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the Knicks game last night?
No, I was busy at work. who were they playing against?
The knicks were playing against the Chicago Bulls
the Bulls? they haven't been any good since Jordan left
I never liked Michael Jordan. Too flashy. I like underdogs
Jordan was the best player ever!
Have you ever been to a basketball game?
I went to the Brooklyn Nets game last night.
What is your favorite Basketball team?
I love NY so i have to say its the Knicks even though they don't win often.
I am going to try out for my High School basketball team
You need to wear new sneakers and you aren't very good at 3 pointers
I think Shaq was the better basketball player and should have starred in SpaceJam
I never saw space jam but i disagree because Jordan is the best
I can't believe it's already time for March Madness!
Me too! I love St.Johns!
BasketBall is my favorite sport
I like basketball too but I think hockey is better.
My name is Michael Jordan. How are you??
Oh my God! you were on he Chicago Bulls!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you fill out your bracket yet?
Yeah, I actually filled out three.
Are you in a pool, or are they just for you?
I'm in one pool at work and one at the bar.  One is just for me.
Who do you have in the Final Four?
I took Kansas, North Carolina, Duke, and Gonzaga in my work pool.
Do you really think Kansas will get to the Final Four?
Yeah, they've been playing well at the end of the season.
I don't know, man.  They usually fold in the tournament.
Well, maybe this year they won't.
I don't know about that Gonzaga pick, either.
Why not?  They've been solid all year.
Yeah, but their conference is weak.
That doesn't matter; their coach can work magic.
I'm sticking with the Tarheels to go all the way.
Yeah, Roy looks pretty focused this year, and he's got a good team.
I'd like to see Kansas win, but I'm just not feeling it.
Self seems like a good guy, but sometimes his teams just can't finish.
You have to love this time of year.
Indeed, it's March Madness, baby!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Morning.
Hi.
You a basketball fan.
Yeah I guess so. you?
Yeah I like basketball okay.
Do you like a particular team?
I like Syracuse.
Oh like college?
Yeah.
Oh okay.  I don't really follow college that much.
You don't watch March Madness?
Nope.
It sure is fun to watch.
I just can't get into it.
What is it about pros that you like?
I guess the stars and the skill.
They are good, but I always liked College more.
Agree to disagree.
Good chat.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Arizona Diamondbacks this year?
Yes, I watched yesterday in San Diego.  What do you think of the catcher who got hit by a pitch a few weeks back?
It was pretty amazing that he came back and hit a home run in his first game.
I agree, it was pretty phenomenal.  Do you think the pitcher hit him on purpose?
I believe these guys are professionals and have great control but in the same sense they are human.
Yes, humans make errors but something in my gut says it was on purpose.
I too feel it was intentional even though he says it was an accident.
How do you feel the Diamondbacks are doing this season?
I like their chances this year to at least make the playoffs.
Me too, they are playing some pretty good ball and as long as they keep playing as a team, they will be fine
How about the Baltimore Orioles in the American league.  What do you think about how they are playing?
The Orioles are definitely turning some heads this season.  I am not sure they can keep it up at their current pace.
I have to agree, they have definitely played well at the beginning of the season with the second best record in all of baseball.
Yes, and they have one of the hardest rivals in all of baseball.  They have to play the NY Yankees and even if the Yankees record sucks, they will always play the Orioles hard.
Pretty crazy how baseball teams have rivals that always play each other hard.
Yes, both the Orioles and the Red Sox are big time rivals with the Yankees. Who was your all time favorite Yankee?
You know, I don't have to go back that far to say Derek Jieter.  Who is your all time favorite baseball player?
I would have to say Cal Ripkin because I grew up watching him play for the Orioles.  Man could that boy play some ball.
I really enjoyed watching Ripkin play but I truly loved when Earl Weaver was their coach.
Oh yes, he could cover up home plate better then any other coach in the majors.  He was iconic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey wanna play some Ball later?
For sure i am looking forward to getting some game on
I know we have not done so in quite some time
Yeah it used to be a weekly thing we would play some basketball.
I will win like the old times though you know.
We we will be seeing about that.
I got some thoughts though.
What thoughts you got?
I been thinking about  the wizards lately i love them as a team but..
What you mean bro?
Well they traded richards and are literally shooting themselves in the foot i do not get why.
I can agree he was their top scoring player  and they are just going down with this.
It is honestly just sad to see
I agree their is no telling how they will do with a unknown.
Yeah without someone you know it is not dependable
Who knows if the new kid can make 90 percent of the shots like richards could
He might have terrible aim and miss most of them
Exactly and then the fans will see their team in disgrace
Yeah its a shame to the fans and to the team
I hope that the new guy is good see you soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cavaliers are having a cake walk into the finals
There is no team in the East who can compete with them right now
They are undefeated in the playoffs
Yeah I know they have been dominating the competition.
Just to think a lot of pundits were worried about this team before the playoffs
Yeah I know everyone was doubting them because of their regular season
Now we see how much of a joke that was
Yeah they are stomping on the competition right now
After the 1st round none of their games have been that competitive.
Lebron James is just running over people
Yeah he cannot be stopped
He's starting to remind me of Jordan
How is that?
Teams seem intimidated by him before he even steps on the court
I know it's like they are scared of him
Exactly. He has already won the mental battle before the games  begin
Yeah this Cleveland team and Lebron are rolling
I just wish they had some competitive games
Yeah me too. This has been way to easy for them
Well at least the Finals should be a lot more competitive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the deal with John Wall just taking over all of a sudden?
What do you mean all of a sudden he has been a top point guard for years?
Well yeah but now he is really taking over.
I suppose but I think you just were not paying attention to him before.
That is possible but maybe there is reason if he cannot dominate the Celtics.
Well is it really his fault, he has been going crazy but no one is helping him out.
I don't think that is true. I just think the Wizards may not be there yet.
I guess but the Bulls gave the Celtics the same challenge as the Wizards.
I am not sure that is totally sure.
Well the series is likely to end up with the same series score.
Maybe, but the Bulls also had playoff Rondo who was playing out of his mind.
True but the the argument is if Wall is really a top point guard, and based on what you said he falls into the Rondo category.
Well what i actually said is he falls into the "playoff Rondo" category which is a totally different thing.
True.  I wish he hadn't gotten injured cause who knows what would have happened with the Bulls.
Yeah they were clearly the worse team but they were going insane until he went down.
Yeah it makes me wonder if they will bring him back next year.
I doubt it.  He wasn't even starting earlier in the year.
True but maybe his playoff performance will get him paid.
Possibly but he has a history of being inconsistent.
That makes a lot of sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team did Larry Bird play for?
He played for the Boston Celtics.
Is he in the hall of fame?
He certainly is, and his number was retired by the Celtics.
What position did he play during his career?
He was a forward.
I saw that he won some championships in his career.
Yes, 3 times in fact, and he was the most valuable player in two finals series.
Did he every play in the olympics?
Yes, in 1992, along with other great basketball players at the time.
I saw Paul Pierce play for the Celtics, and seemed to be as good as you described Larry Bird to be.
Pierce won a championship and finals MVP when he played for the Celtics.
Did he play with Larry Bird?
No. Bird retired several years before Pierce was ever drafted.
I'm sure I saw Paul Pierce play for other teams also.
Yes, later on in his career, he played for the Brooklyn Nets, Washington Wizards, and finally, the L.A. Clippers.
I remember that Pierce played the forward position in his career, just like Bird.
He sure did, and he is regarded as one of the best Celtics to ever play.
I think he should be in the hall of fame in the future.
I agree, and I'm pretty sure the Celtics will retire his number.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's next for Virginia?
Rolling over and dying.
That's hilarious but seriously.
God, I know.
Know what?
They suck. They're gone.
Really?
They're absolutely dead.
I think you're right.
Of course I'm right.
Not an absolute.
I'm never wrong.
You're plenty wrong. You were wrong with the Nicks.
I was absurdly right with the Nicks.
You were wrong with the League.
I wasn't.
You were.
I was right on the rules but with a different tilt.
No.
Absolutely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't watch Lebron tonight!
Oh, I forgot the game was coming on tonight.
It comes on tonight at 8:30.
I should come over.
You are gonna have to wear your jersey.
Okay, maybe I will wear my Irving Jersey.
That sounds good.
Do you think the Celtics may steal a win?
Heck no! The Cavs has it in the bag!
Not a slight chance?
Absolutely not. its their first game home.
Oh, this might not be good.
I am gonna call this a 35 point game win easy.
Little Isiah, on the Celtics, may show up tonight.
What did I say? There is no possible way.
Cleavland is on fire!
Told you. Irving and Love together are going to be unstoppable.
I think that I better go pull out my jersey.
I am going to get the snacks ready,
See you in a few.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the March Madness games this year?
Na, I don't really watch college ball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see game 2 between the Spurs and Warriors.
Yep, I feel kinda bad for the poor Spurs.
I know right. They were blown out by 36 points.
Yep, it was pretty sad.
Well, what can you do when the star player is injured?
The bench players have to pick up the slack.
Who on the Spurs bench can do that?
The only player with a lot of playoff experience is Manu.
Yes, but Manu is 39 years old. He can only do so much.
That's true. I guess the other players will have to step it up.
One of the Spurs' rookie players named Murray is coming along.
I saw him. He played pretty decent.
That's correct. He gave them a decent 8 points and also 6 assists.
He also had 6 rebounds too.
Yep, I think the Spurs will continue to give him more playing time.
I think so. They are probably looking ahead to the future.
On the Warriors side, Curry scored 29 points.
Yes, he hit a sizzling 6 three pointers.
Do the Spurs even stand a chance against this team?
I don't think so. It will be very difficult for the Spurs to beat the Warriors without Kawhi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the championship this year?
My guess is the Cavaliers.
Are you a fan of the Cavaliers?
Not really, but I like LeBron.
Oh, I'm just not much of a fan of his.
Who do you think is going to win?
I think the Warriors are going to make it this year.
You really think they are that good?
Yes, I really do.
Did you just jump on the bandwagon?
Maybe. I really like the way Curry plays.
Ugh. I think he's nothing but a showoff.
Why do you think that?
Look at the shots he takes.
Yeah, but he makes a lot of them. He's good
If you say so.
He makes a lot better shots than Lebron.
I guess we can't agree on everything.
I guess not.
Can't wait to see who wins!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the NBA Finals this year?
I'm not sure. Who's playing in it again?
The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors are in the finals.
Again? That's crazy.
They're the best teams in the league by far.
I think the Warriors will win this year.
Why do you say that?
They have the best team, I think. Curry is unstoppable.
But what about LeBron James?
Well, the Warriors have Curry, Durant, and others. Cleveland can't rely on just LeBron!
That's true. But I think the Cavs will repeat this year.
It's possible. Whoever wins, it's sure to be a great series.
I think it was smart of LeBron to leave Miami and come back to Cleveland.
I think so too. He made a lot of fans angry when he left the first time.
He wanted to win a championship and he couldn't do it in Cleveland.
That's true. But now the Cavs have a team that could win.
You're right about the Warriors though, they have a lot of talent on their team.
Yeah, but they need to make sure to put pressure in the key. They can't rely on offense.
The Cavs too. Basketball is so offensive these days.
Yeah, every team could stand to learn better defense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey were you at the game last night?
Which game?
The Shiners and the Warriors game.
No!  I didn't know they were playing last night.
Yeah, the Shiners killed the Warriors.
Oh, that's kinda surprising.  I thought the Warriors were supposed to win.
That's what I had heard too but apparently not.
So what happened?
Well, it was pretty close at half time but towards the end Williams got several three pointers and then some free throws that really tipped things in their favor.
Williams always gets the long shots.
Yeah I know.  It was close though.
What was the final score?
I think it was like 78-75 or something like that.
Wow that is close.
Yeah!  So next week the Shiners are playing the Combats at home.
I'll probably go to that one.
Yeah, be sure to go early.  There was almost no parking left when I got there.
Where were they playing?
At the Johnson Center.
Oh, yeah their parking always sucks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you Think Kobe Bryant is better than Lebron James?
No because Lebron is better.
But Kobe has 5 championships.
That's not fair because he has played 20 seasons.
But he's been to the finals the same amount of times as Lebron which gave them equal opportunity.
True but Lebron's career is not over.
I'm just saying you can't be better than someone and not have more championships.
Robert Horry has more championships than Michael Jordan does that make him better than him?
I guess you have a point there.
I will admit Kobe has had a better career than Lebron.
Doesn't that make him better?
No because just because he had a better career doesn't mean he is more skilled.
Please elaborate.
Lebron is a more skilled player than Kobe but Kobe has been around longer.
What skills does Lebron have that Kobe doesn't?
Lebron can pass, rebound, play defense, run and EVERYTHING else.
So what you're saying is that Kobe is good at some things but Lebron is good at everything?
Yes, Kobe never shot above 47 percent from the field in a season but Lebron has shot 57 percent from the field in a season.
So I see, Kobe has had the better career but Lebron is a better player.
Exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
You doing okay today?
Yep, you?
Doing good. You a basketball fan at all?
Yep, I like it quite a bit.
Any team you like?
I like the Hawks.
Cool, I like the Wizards.
Does John Wall play there?
Yeah that's right.
How are they doing?
They're in the playoffs, but down to the Celtics.
What is it at?
3-2.
Oh I see.
Yeah I hope they can come back though.
That will be tough.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see how well the Warriors play together this year?
No I havent been watching them this playoff season.
It is quite a show.
Is KD taking over?
No they dont even need him to do that.
Wow they may need it against Lebron.
Yes I think they are ready and waiting.
Yes that is going to be exciting.
It is Steph Curry who is dominating.
Wow how can he when he is somewhat small for an NBA player.
He does it with his shooting.
How can he get open for a shot so consistently?
He is really quick.
And he gets a lot of screens set for him?
No he actually creates his own shot.
How does he do that?
His jumper is so quick.
Oh that explains it.
Yes his jumper is a thing of beauty.
Ok I will will watch his next game and enjoy the show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who do you think will win the NBA finals this year?
Aren't I supposed to say the Warriors will win? Isn't everyone saying that?
I guess they are. Everyone does say it.
So doesn't that end the conversation?
It only ends it if you want it to. Do you think the warriors will win?
No, I don't. I'm betting on the Cavaliers.
Why the Cavaliers? They haven't been given a lot of chance by most people.
No, but look at their strengths. They have LeBron James.
LeBron James can't win it by himself, can he?
No, but he goes a long way.
That is true. He does go a long way. But can he beat an overall better team like the Warriors?
He did last year. And I don't see why he can't repeat.
Okay, that makes sense to me. What would LeBron and the Cavs need to do to win.
Well, the first order of business is obviously that they need LeBron to play an excellent series.
Okay, I've got that. But are there any other orders of business?
Yes, LeBron has to get his teammates involved.
Involved in what way? Just by getting more assists?
Yes, more assists are good. But he also can't shoot the ball so much. Wouldn't you agree?
Yes, that's how they'd win. I'm far less confident than you that it will actually happen. I'm still betting on the Warriors.
Sounds good. Let's find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They need to change the three point line.
Why?
It disincentivizes fun play.
What kind of play?
It ruins fast play.
It means players have to be less aggressive?
Kind of.
I could see that.
I think the movement is fine.
Really?
Like, the actual movement.
I don't think the movement is fine at all.
It's just that they need to encourage cleverer play.
Not really.
Like, more loops and careful movement.
Well. I guess?
They can move as slow as they want.
Well, I suppose.
As long as it encourages decent movement and complexity, like? It's fine.
I suppose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch the Spurs and Rockets game?
Yeah. Did you see that Kawhi Leonard is injured?
Yeah. It will be tough for San Antonio to win without him.
Agreed but the Spurs are tough.
James Harden will have to have a good game for Houston to win.
True, they will be eliminated if they lose.
Harden needs to get help from his teammates.
I think Eric Gordon will come up big for Houston tonight.
Who is going to step for San Antonio?
I think Danny Green will make some big shots.
He's had a good series.
I think LaMarcus Aldridge will have to carry the team, though.
Agreed. He signed a big contract and needs to step up.
Who do you think wins?
This is tough but I can't see the Spurs winning without Leonard.
Agreed, it could be a blowout.
I disagree. I think it will be a close game.
I think it will be 107-90 Houston.
I think the Spurs will win in overtime.
I hope it is a close game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know about the latest game.
With who?
Celtics.
What about them?
You can tell they're losing their touch.
Because of the brain drain?
No, defense.
Their playbook.
Yeah.
They've got a weird playbook.
They don't know what they're doing.
They have weird ideas.
Definitely.
They always try dumb plays.
Oh, god, yeah.
They love to do that.
I don't like them.
They're interesting.
Are they?
They always do something different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you go to the game last night?
The basketball game?  Where was it?
At the high school.  It was a home game.
No, I had to work.
Oh, you totally missed it.  It was awesome!
Oh, yeah?  We won?
Yeah, the score was 87-42.
Wow.  That means the team is heading to the playoffs, right?
Yeah, the first round is next week I think.
Well, I'm going to have to make sure to take off for that one.
Yeah, that one is an away game, but we can ride together.
That sounds good.  So, I guess they buckled up on their defense?
Well, yeah.  The score at halftime was 42-30.
Seriously?  So, they only allowed 12 points to be scored in the whole second half?
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you it was awesome!
Wow, the other coach must have been livid!
Oh, he was, you should have heard him!
Those poor kids on that team though.
Well, at least their season is over and he won't be yelling at them anymore.
I guess if you look at it that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game this Saturday with the Warriors?
No I didn't, who was playing this weekend?
The Warriors against the San Antonio Spurs played last night, it was a great game.
Really, what was the score?
The Warriors pulled out a win, 120-108.  it was really well played.
Nice, I like games leek that, close but not too close!
David Lee injured his knee, he had to be taken out for that injury.
Ouch, I will have to watch the replay on that one.
Yeah , he won't be playing in the Western conference finals.
Wow, I can't beleive anotehr player of theirs was taken out due to injury.
They had to take him off the court in a wheel chair
I am sure he was pretty ticked.
Kevin Durant was a strong player in this game.
How well did he do?
Kevin scored thirty-three total points in this game.
He sounds like an MVP player of the game.
He was outstanding to watch, the heat didn't seem to get to him, he remained calm in the game.
I will go home and see if I can find anything online with some replays!
You should, it was really fun to watch.  Are you going to come over tomorrow night to watch more?
Yeah sure, sounds great.  See you then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Celtics will get the first pick in the draft.
Oh really? Any word on who the might select?
Either Markelle Fultz or Lonzo Ball from what I've heard.
Cool. Who got 2nd dibs?
The Lakers.
I bet the Knicks pick 3rd right?
Nope. They're 8th.
What? I thought they'd be in the top five atleast.
The Celtics only had a 25% chance of being first.
I didn't expect them to have first pick with those odds.
The Nets will make two first-round selections at picks 22 and 27.
Good for them I guess.
Guess which team rounded out the bottom.
The Bulls?
No, they're 24th in line.
What about Orlando?
25th. You're getting closer.
I give up? Who is it?
The Jazz.
That's surprising.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know what direction the Dallas Mavericks organization is going?
I don't either. I mean Nowitzki is still there maybe they're waiting for his era to be over.
Yeah, but I don't think you can afford to do that
You're right! Especially in the Western Conference.
You cannot afford to be mediocre. Either you suck or you add pieces to get better through free agency
When you look at their roster. Where's their future?
Exactly. I mean Harrison Barnes is a good player, but not great
And Wesley Matthews is a good defender, but a horrible shooter
This roster has holes every where
Yeah I mean they did pick up Nerlens Noel, but has he already maximized his talent?
I thought he would be a little bit better than he is but maybe he needs more time.
You could be right, but when I see him play I just don't see it.
Keep in mind he did deal with some injuries. I think he deserves a little more time
Perhaps, but they need way more than what he can offer
Yeah he is a decent piece but they need star power
Who wants to come to this team the way that it is presently constructed.
That in lies the problem doesn't it.
It really does. I men they have some okay complimentary pieces but it's just not enough.
They need more scores and three point shooters on this team
My thoughts exactly. They got a lot of work to do, but I do love their owner, Mark Cuban.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you watched the nba lately?
not really, why?
seems to be a lot of dramas going on
what kind of dramas?
injury, trash talking, the usual.
have you played basketball lately?
yes, I went to the court the other day.
were you with anyone else?
yeah, just some buddy shooting hoops and free throws
I was thinking of setting up pick up games
that sounds like a good idea
when are you free?
I am free most nights
what about weekends?
I am free on the weekends too
so then let's set up weekend pick up games.
like five on five?
yeah, that works.
who do you want to invite
whoever wants to play
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, wanna catch the next Lakers game?
Yeah! When is it? I haven't been to a game in forever!
It's this Friday night against the Jazz.  I know how much you hate them.
Oh my gosh I'd love to go, but I have a football game that night, and won't be free until 10pm.
That sucks, I don't think you've been to Staples Center yet huh?
No! I've been dying to go now. The last Laker game I went to was at the Forum.
Damn that was a long time ago.  Are you serious that you haven't been to Staples Center yet?
No, that's why I'm so mad I can't go to the game.
That sucks, it's an amazing arena, with bars all over the place.
How is the parking and the prices of the concessions?
Parking is ok, but a bit expensive. They have lots of great concessions, but of course they're way overpriced.
Well, another reason why I'd rather enjoy the Laker game at home.  Cheap beer and no lines to the restroom.
Yeah, you're right.  So have you been able to follow the Lakers at all?
Well, I don't watch the games on TV like I used to, and I heard that Jeannie Buss is now the only owner.
Yeah, I know, who would've thought that she would be able to push out her brothers?
I know.  At least she'll keep Phil close by right?
Yeah her and Magic should be able to bring greatness back to LA
I certainly hope so, it's been too long since we had the Championship.
Yeah well if they make it you better go with me to the playoffs!
Well, if you have tickets then I'll be there with all my Laker gear!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you see what the Warriors are doing?
Yea, they haven't lost in the playoffs.
Are they even gonna lose? This is amazing.
I doubt it. Look who they have.
Yea, but the Spurs are a team and they still can't come close.
Steph, Klay, Durant, and Draymond. Need I say more?
True, true, but nobody can win a game!
Yea, well those guys are games. You wanna go against them?
I sure dont, but Lebron does.
Yea, Lebron wont lose in 4 to them.
I agree too much pride. Can you take them down though.
Not by himself no.
It would take a great series by Kyrie.
More than that.
You're right. Guys off that bench would have to really show up.
Yea, they would have to do even more than show up and chip in.
I agree. They would have to be stars.
Yea. I dont know if they can do that.
Neither do I, but we will find out.
Yes we will. yes we will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that the Spurs lost to the Rockets?
I did, but I still think that the Spurs will win the series.
I saw that the Utah Jazz were eliminated last night?
They were, but they showed a lot of heart.
I think that the Lakers will be bad next year.
Probably, but maybe they will get a good draft pick.
Russell Westrbrook should win the most valuable player award this year.
I disagree, I think that James Harden should win.
Who do you think will win the sixth man of the year award?
I think that James Johnson will win.
Do you think that Lonzo Ball will be a good professional basketball player?
I think he will be average at best.
Do you think that Chris Bosh will ever play professional basketball again?
I think that he will retire.
I think that Kawhi Leonard should win defensive player of the year.
I think that Draymond Green is more deserving.
I hope that The Cleveland Cavaliers do not win the championship this year.
Me too,  I hope that the Spurs do.
I was sad to see that Tony Parker is injured for the rest of the playoffs.
Me too, he was playing really well in these playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are you crowning for MVP this year?
Harden had one of the best seasons ever.
He played out of his mind.
I think that has to do with the guys around him.
Yeah they werent that good.
So he was taking the majority of shots.
The offense ran through him.
You also cant discount Westbrook either.
I think he was in a similar situation.
The amount of triple doubles he had is astounding.
Well for a guy with no other options it was par for the course.
Could Oscar Robertson do that in todays NBA?
Probably  could still do it.
So we have it narrowed down, who you giving it to.
I would say Harden.
Its good that its a debatable question.
I think James is mad he wasnt on the list.
I mean as far as value to his team, i dont know.
Harden was the team.
And so was Westbrook.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the crazy dunk LeBron had?
Wait, what game?
Two days ago. With the Heat.
What was crazy about it?
He broke the backboard.
What?
He broke the backboard again.
Didn't they change the glass.
Yeah, but he broke the backboard.
Jesus.
I know, it's nuts.
They won, right?
Yes, they extremely won.
No overtime, right.
God no.
That's insane.
I screamed.
Seriously?
I actually screamed.
That's nuts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you have between the Spurs and Rockets tomorrow?
Spurs all the way, I can't stand Houston.
My heart says San Antonio, but my mind says Houston is going to take this series.
What makes you say that?
I think the Houston offense is just too much for the Spurs. It's too fast and too strong.
Well, the Spurs did win 3 out of 4 during the regular season.
The regular season doesn't matter anymore though, the playoffs is its own season.
You don't think Kawhi Leonard can outplay James Harden?
Maybe he can, but what about the rest of the team? In the last game, the Rockets were looking like they had too many weapons to stop.
Sure, but the two games before that were all San Antonio.
That's true, but as the series goes on, I think the Spurs get more tired. They have some old players.
True, but I think there are enough young players that can get minutes and be effective, too.
Only if Popovich decides to play them. He is stubborn about going with his veterans.
That does frustrate me at times, but he has shown that he knows what he's doing.
Anyway, I will be rooting for the Spurs, even if I don't think they'll win. I can't stand Harden.
Me either. The NBA really needs to look into how he tries to bait the refs into calling fouls and change the rules this season.
That would be nice, but it would be even nicer to have him embarrassed by the Spurs.
Amen to that.
Anyway, whatever happens in this series I still think Golden State will destroy either team in the next round.
Unfortunately, I think you're right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Daren did you watch that blowout yesterday ?
No what happened?
It was the phoenix suns versus the Indiana pacers
Was it that old video you were telling me about on Sport Center.
Yes, it was so good.
No i didn't get a chance.
Well Reggie Miller really made his team look good he was playing against Charles Barkley
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the playoffs?
Which playoffs?
Professional basketball playoffs.
No, not so far. Have you?
Yeah, my team is in the semi finals.
What is your team?
The Miami Heat.
Why do you like the Heat?
Mostly because I grew up in Miami.
That makes sense.
Do you play any ball?
No, not really.
That's too bad.
Why is that too bad?
Me and some guys play a game on Wednesdays.
Oh, that could be fun.
You want to try it?
Sure, why not.
Okay, tomorrow at the court right over there around noon.
Sounds like fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the Spurs Rockets game tonight?
I think the Rockets will win.
Why do you think the Rockets will win?
Because they have to win or they are out and they are playing at home.
Do you think it will be a high scoring game.
Yes, I think the Rockets are going to try to run and will hit their 3's.
If they do win tonight, do you think the Rockets will win the series?
No, IO think San Antonio will win the final game.
Why do you think that?
Because they will be playing at home where they are very good.
But the Rockets were a good road team.
Yes, but the Spur's coach is one of the best in the league.
do you think the Rockets have a real chance to win the series?
Yes, but they will have to hit their 3's.
If the Rockets do win the series, do you think they can beat the Warriors?
No way.  golden State is too good.
Do you think the Spurs can beat the Warriors?
Yes, but it is not likely.
Why don't you think so?
Because the Spurs are much older and slower.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the NBA playoffs?
Yes, the San Antonio Spurs beat the Houston Rockets pretty badly!
I think the Rockets would have done better if James Harden played better tonight.
Yes, he played well during the regular season, but did not perform as well during the playoffs.
Now that they beat the Rockets, how do you think the Spurs will do against the Golden State Warriors?
Both teams are excellent.  That is why they are the first and second seeds in the Western Conference.
I think Golden State will win.  They swept the Utah Jazz easily to get here.
Well, Golden State did win 67 games in the regular season.
Stephen Curry has made Golden State a team that always wins a lot.
But San Antonio won 61 games this season.  They are also very strong.
Kawhi Leonard has done very well for San Antonio.
I think the Warriors win in 6 games, but it will be a close series.
I see the Golden State Warriors winning the championship too.
I agree.  I think the Cleveland Cavaliers will be their opponents in the finals.
Cleveland will win the Eastern Conference, but either the Spurs or the Warriors will beat them.
I think Cleveland just needs more strong players besides Lebron James.
But Kyrie Irving is a another good player for the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Yes, but he is very young.  He will be better when he is older.
Either way, I cannot wait to see who plays in the 2017 NBA Finals.
Me too.  2017 has been a great year to watch basketball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Golden state Warriors versus the Utah Jazz Playoff Game 3?
Yeah.  It was the closest game yet. The Jazz seem to be losing by exactly 11 points each of the past 2 games.
It was amazingly close considering the Jazz  have been playing without Guard George Hill for two straight games.
I think the Warriors would have blown the Jazz out if Draymond Green didn't get in foul trouble and if steph' and Klay weren't throwing up bricks all night.
True.  Steph' Curry and Klay Tompson were really ice cold shooting.
Yeah,.  By contrast Jazz Shelvin Mack was THE playmaker for the Jazz- scoring, playing hard defense while most of the other players seemed to not be interested.
The Jazz played well the 1st half leading by 2 points.  But after that, it was all downhill.
The Jazz couldn't hit the broad side of a barn in the second half............
While the Warriors were getting the ball to Durant and playing the type of ball that got them into the playoffs again.
Rudy Gobert and Gordon Hayward were indecisive and gave open shots to guys like Joe Johnson who never shot well.
If the Jazz get Gobert and Hayward involved and let them shoot at will they have a chance of extending the series at least one more game.
The Warriors are a good defense team but the Jazz were ranked higher  defensively during the regular season.
That means nothing in the playoffs...............
It looks like Rudy Gobert will be playing in the next playoff game. Hopefully he'll bring his shooting ability with him.
He's only scored 21 points on his best game so far this series!
I know but he is a rebounding machine- 15 rebounds in his best game.
Rebounds are good but if a team can't shoot............
Utah shot 7/22 from outside in this game which is not very good for them.
If steph' Curry and Kevin Durant score 30 plus points each in the next game the party  is over for the Jazz.  I see a Warriors sweep coming!
Rudy Gobert and Gordon Hayward need to be on fire shooting for this next game.  I think that they will be and will carry the Jazz to victory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Boy the Celtics just weren't ready for the Cavs
The Cavs just have too much firepower
Yeah, as much as I love Isiah Thomas, he doesn't have enough help
I mean the Cavs are just bullying them
I don't think the Cavs ever took the Celtics seriously
I don't believe they did either.
Watching these games feels like a scrimmage
I mean they were beating this team by 41 points at one time
On their home court!
Exactly! This seems like practice for the Cavs
So that they can get ready for the real series against the Warriors
I agree with you. This was fine tuning for the Cavs
That's why the Celtics should have made some deals during the trade deadline.
Yeah if they could have added another star, it could've made a difference
But for now they are over matched and overwhelmed.
For sure. I mean they have had a great season
Especially considering the tragedy that Isiah Thomas went through.
I don't know how he played so well after his sister died.
Yeah kudos goes out to him. He is one tough cookie.
I guess you have to be tough when you are only about 5 feet and 9 inches.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i have to say the golden state worriers are the best team in the NBA.
i disagree the best team is the Cleveland cavaliers.
How? Curry ans the warriors have the most games won in NBA history.
True, but if you look at the stats the cavs can actually close out a game may i remind you of the finals last year?
dont start with that it was last years, its a new season
but your telling me that the warriors are the best Nba team How if the blew a 3-1 lead?
shut up we get it
im just saying you cant say they are the best. besides if steph were to leave they would be better off without him
no he holds the team together best 3 shooter of all time.
yeah but where is his all around skill he is decent at best all around player
well kevin durant can do it all
he is a bitch he is only in it to win a ring he gave up on okc like a child not getting his candy
well klay thompson is a beast
klay thompson should leave the warriors he can lead a team
they are like Mj and Pippin
dont even compare them to the bulls
they beat the bulls win streak last year they are not to compare
the 91-95 bulls were the ultiment winning machines
they couldnt beat the worriers
look i cant talk to you your a worriers fan that is ignorant to the whole NBA players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the basketball game last night?
Yes, and I couldn't believe how bad the calls were.
It seemed like the refs were oblivious when a player deliberately elbowed someone.
I don't think those refs would have noticed if one team had 7 players on the court and the other team had 3 players.
You're probably right.
I hate poorly refereed games. It takes the emphasis off of two teams trying to prove who is better, it's just which team gets luckier with the ref's calls.
Have you ever seen murderball?
What the heck is muderball?
Disabled athletes who are confined to wheelchairs play against each other. Some have other disabilities, too. The games are absolutely amazing.
How can they play basketball with wheelchairs out on the court?
They're special wheelchiars, designed to go faster and turn sharper. Those athletes aren't just playing basketball like regular teams, they're pushing their wheelchairs as fast as they can go the whole time.
You must get some serious upper body workout from that.
Exactly. I love watching those games because the dedication and athleticism of the players is so awesome. It really is inspiring.
Last night's game had fouls, Do murderball games have fouls?
They have brutal fouls. If somebody gets thrown an elbow when the ref isn't looking, it can even knock the player's chair over on the court and knock the player to the floor.
Sounds like murderball is more punishing on athletes than ordinary basketball.
It's gaining in popularity and has become an Olympic sport because the games are so exciting. They're addictive.
Do they have women's teams too?
Of course! Just like there are women basketball teams, there are women murderball teams. They don't get any breaks because they're women, they train and play just as hard as the women.
You've got me really interested in finding out more about this. I want to see a game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like basketball?
Yeah, definitely. I played in high school and I like watching it.
Oh cool, I played in high school as well, but only junior varsity.
That's cool. I played through high school on both junior varsity and varsity.
Oh wow, you must have been pretty good.
I was alright, but nothing special. Do you follow professional or college basketball at all?
Yeah, I mainly follow college basketball, but I pay attention to the NBA on and off.
I'm kind of the opposite. I am a die hard NBA fan and sort of follow college basketball.
Oh okay, yeah, it's just hard for me to get super interested in the NBA. The season is fairly long and my team isn't very good.
Yeah, I can see that. I'm a fan of the San Antonio Spurs, so it's been easy to get excited about the NBA in recent years.
Well yeah, the Spurs have been at least a decent NBA team for the past 20 years. They've won like 4-5 championships in that time or something like that.
Yeah, they're great. They have a great coach and have been really good about managing personnel.
I'm a fan of the Charlotte Hornets, who aren't very good and haven't been for a while, so it's hard for me to get excited about it.
Yeah, that's understandable
My college team is the North Carolina Tar Heels, who have had much more success in college than the Hornets have had in the NBA.
Oh yeah, that's one of the more famous basketball schools. Didn't Michael Jordan go to school there?
Yep, and we won the national championship this year, which was awesome.
Oh yeah, I remember that. That must've been exciting.
It was awesome and I got super pumped when they won.
Yeah, I can imagine. Unfortunately, I don't think the Spurs will even be getting to the championship series this year, but maybe next year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think's going to win the NBA finals this year?
It has to be the Warriors right, they are too strong. Who do you got?
I like the Cavs, they still have LeBron, the best player in the world.
Yeah, but the his team gas looked good in the playoffs but they been some bad teams.
Indiana and Toronto are not bad teams!
Yes they are, they wouldn't even sniff the playoffs if they were in the Western Conference.
Yes they would. Who has the Warriors played anyways?
The Blazers and Utah. Utah is a great young team and the Blazers have Lillard.
True but you can't seriously tell me that either team is better than Toronto.
Toronto has no heart, they choke in the playoffs.
Just like the Warriors last year.
No you didn't! Ok last year was bad but this year they have Kevin Durant.
It won't make a difference because LeBron has owned him in the playoffs.
Yes, but he was on a different team and a different system. The warriors are too efficient with too many weapons right now.
Why don't you talk to me if you get past the Spurs, because it's not given that they can even beat them.
Oh please. The old and slow Spurs without Tony Parker and a hurt Kawai.
Hey they beat them 2 out of 3 this year and the Spurs are 8-1 without Kawai.
The first loss was the first game of the season when they were still figuring it out and the last one they didn't even play their starter. They have too much talent and look better than the Spurs all around.
Ok let's make a bet, $20 says the Spurs or Cavs  beat them this year.
Make it $100 and it's a bet. Unless you are too scared.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe the fans booed KD?
Well, they figure he left them out of greed, when really he went for opportunity over at Golden State.
How great is the OKC Thunder?
They could do better, but the season is young.
Did you see that half-court shot?
Yes! But what about the foul by Bird?
You think John's gonna make the free throws?
I don't know, he flubbed that lay up.
Did you see the Bulls play last night?
No, man, I was watching the Knicks.
The Laker game was super great.
Right? Did you see that three point shot?
KD looked tired last night, but still scored the most points.
Golden State is lucky to have him.
You think our team will make the playoffs?
No, but the Thunder will.
Man, I can't believe all the travelling violations last night.
For sure, it's like they forgot how to dribble.
The Mavericks looked good last week.
Yeah, but the Jazz looked even better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how did you like that Carolina game last night?
Oh my! It was so intense!
I know, I can't stand Duke and it was so nice to see them lose.
Yeah it was. I could not believe Butler did that to Hansbrough
Yeah that was so cheap!
I hope he gets suspended from a few games for that one
Me too! Hansbrough is going to have to play through the whole tournament with that guard over his face now
Yeah hopefully it wont interfere with his playing ability
I doubt it will since he is so good anyway. He can still power through from inside the paint.
Yeah that's true. Do you think they're going to win the tournament?
I always have UNC down to win the NCAA!
Me too, but we will see this year. It always scares me!
Yeah but the team is so strong, no one can stop them.
That is true, Lawson is such a good point guard
Yeah he is.I will be so sad when they all go to the NBA
Me too but hopefully a few will stay around to finish up college first.
yeah that is the smart thing to do but when the money calls, you gotta take it while you can.
This is true!
Well, Fingers crossed that we win the tournament over the next few weeks!
Exactly! I have my toes crossed too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you're a basketball fan, right?
Yup! I've been following basketball for years.
What's your favorite team?
The NY Knicks.
Have they been doing well lately?
... No. Definitely no. They've been a trainwreck.
That bad?
Unfortunately, yes.
Why have they been doing so poorly?
Mainly really, really stupid trades.
Ooh. That bad, huh.
Yup. And wasting most of their money on a well-known player who's now past his prime.
But isn't paying for well-known players pretty common?
Probably, but I think there are better team-building strategies.
What would you recommend?
Building a team of good, young players.
Why would you reccomend that?
Several reasons. They're cheaper. They can build a good camaraderie as they're all new.
Anything else?
And when they become well-known players they hopefully feel some loyalty to the Knicks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so ready for next year's college season.
Why do you say that?
I believe any number of teams can win the title.
Who do you think will win next year?
The Kentucky Wildcats have the best freshmen class coming in, so they have a great shot.
I agree a little, I guess. I just hate the one and done guys.
i don't like it either- I wish they would make a rule requiring players that go to college stay at least 2 years.
That would be great, but don't think it will happen.
Coach Cal gets the blame for this, but many coaches want these same players.
Even Coach K from Duke recruits the same players.
But, because he is Duke's coach, he doesn't get scrutinized like Coach Cal.
I just get tired of 40-50 freshmen declaring for the draft every year.
Yeah, I love UK, but would like to see these kids play for more than one year.
It takes me a month to get to know the players every year.
I miss the old days when you could watch them grow over 3-4 years.
Unless the rules change, you won't ever see that again.
Can you imagine LeBron playing 3-4 years of college and how much fun that wold have been?
He would have set multiple records in college.
No doubt.
Guess we will have to setttle for watching him win another NBA title thsi year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the NBA should do away with a salary cap?
Yeah I think that it needs to be reworked.
So you wouldnt eliminate it altogether?
No I think that it could cause problems.
Teams would just join up together?
Yeah it creates a balance that you need in the league.
I can see the problem being that teams would try to skip on salaries.
Like the sixers have been?
Well there is a floor that you have to spend
I would rather see super teams to be honest
Baseball doesnt have the problem
They had it for years
But they still have no cap with no problem
Eventually things would work out but it may take 20 years
Then they should start the process now
They already allow teams to keep their own guys regardless of the cap
I know and it makes for a very confusing cap
I think there are several solutions
None of which we ever see implemented
Just have to wait and see how salaries rise or fall
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am always fascinated to tune into a basketball when they are in the play offs, do you?
I too am fascinated by the play offs, though I also watch extensively lots of games leading up to the play offs.
Yeah I get that, I wish that I could watch more often, though time and circumstance may not always afford me that opportunity.
Who are you hoping will make their way to the play offs this season?
I'm a huge fan of the Chicago Bulls.
They are one of my favorite teams as well.
Oh really? Great! Great minds think alike.
Oh yeah we do! I even got season tickets for them as well.
Season Tickets! My how I envy you.
Yeah, well I know someone, who knows someone, and they make sure I can purchase at a very reasonable price.
There's is something that I'd love to have, but to purchase a season pass, I'm hesitant and unsure how many games I'd actually be able to attend.
I hear ya, if you know that more than likely you will not be able to attend over half the games, then it wouldn't be feasible to have season tickets.
You are so correct on that call.
I'm such a huge fan, I make sure that my seating is as close as I can get, third row.
Wow, that's spectacular.
Yeah, any closer like the first or second row when mean forking over a lot more cash.
I hear ya, I feel ya, I know exactly what you mean.
Though the third row gives me ample opportunity to get a close up view of all the best plays.
That is so true, my friend.
Indeed, and I am so stoked about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch the Spurs game on Monday?
Yes I am, I want to see if GS will rest some players.
Do you think the Spurs are looking at the long term picture rather than the now?
Yeah, if not they would be playing Leonard now.
If you had to pick one to start a team around, right now....Lebron or Curry.
This is a hard one but Lebron, he is still the best and most dominate.
Do you ever think the draft is rigged?
All the time how else do you explain how some teams end up with the top 3 pick when it just seems to "fit".
I understand it but I can't believe they took  Kanters passport away and detained him.
Crazy right, I don't think a terrorist would be 7 feet tall.
Did Lebron get snubbed?
Yeah, but I think he's at the point that he cares much more about the NBA Championship.
Should the 76ers trade down?
Yeah, they are rebuilding and can get a lot more with say 2-3 major picks than just 1.
Out of d James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard  who do you think will win?
Russell - its a numbers game and they seem to want to spread the MVP around now.
LeBron is a lot like Shaq; you can give him the award every year if you wanted to.
Yeah, but I feel like you should still give it to the most deserving even if its the same person over and over.
He's going to be a man on a mission now.
Oh yeah, Lebron is definitely going to be playing to prove something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the NBA playoffs?
Yeah, I haven't missed a game yet!  Who are you pulling for?
I am a Celtics fan, but I've watched every game also.  Who do you pull for?
I am pulling for the Warriors.  I hope they pull it off this year!
They have a good chance.  Did you watch the games yesterday?
Yes, the Celtics got crushed.  There haven't been many good games in the 2nd round.
I know, the first round was pretty good, but this second round has been mainly blow out games.
I think it will be the Warriors and the Cavs in the Finals.
I agree.  It sucks that Tony Parker got injured.  That killed the Spurs chances
I know, it was tough to see.  He is such a great player.
Did you see the Wizard playing who got ejected vs the celtics in game 3?
Yes!  That was crazy.  I can't believe he lost his cool like that.
I know.  You can tell he is a young player.
Agreed.  Who do you think wins the MVP this year?
I really hope its Curry again, but it may be Westbrook.  He was insanely good for the Thunder.
I hope it's Curry too, but Westbrook does have a good chance.  So many triple doubles
I really don't want it to be LeBron James though.  I am biased because how he kills the Celtics, but i don't like him
He will definitely be a top choice, but I think it will be Curry or Westbrook.
Hopefully the Finals will be some good games and go to 7 like last year.
As long as the Warriors win this time, I agree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you loving playoff time or what?
No, not really.  My team was put our first round.
Oh yeah, who's your team?
The Memphis Grizzlies.  Yours?
My team is the Warrior's
They are so stacked that it's unfair.
I would agree, but I love it.
I am sure you do.  You even got Matt Barnes from us.
That's right.  He was a welcome addition to the squad.
Yes, we miss him.  Do you play any basketball video games?
I sure do.  I am a 2K fanatic.
Oh wow, I am as well.
That's hilarious. I spent over $600 on VC for NBA2K.
Haha, my wife hates when the theme music comes on for NBA 2K
Do you use the Grizzlies on there?
Nope. Warriors, haha.
It's the only way to go.  They are dropping 3's all day.
As stated, it's unfair how great they are.
It's a great time to be a Warriors fan.
The Grizzlies will take them down again next season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why was the western conference so bad this year?
Its hard to say normally we see this sort of play out of the East
Do you think its just spreading to the NBA?
As in it being too top heavy?
Yeah just about that.
I can see where people think that it is a very top heavy league.
Some of the teams are playing like crap to be honest.
The Clippers had a very strange year.
And the Mavericks were terrible
You could see the direction they were headed though in the beginning of the season.
They are still relying on Nowitzki.
At some point they have to move on
I just dont see them doing that ever
So he retires on his own terms?
That and hes probably going to do it in the middle of a season.
I dont know how he maintains it
I think he wants to break records
At the behest of his franchise?
I admit its selfish
He will always be the greatest euro player
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the NBA playoffs?
Yeah, I can't believe the Cavaliers are sweeping their way through the East.
Do you think any team can stop them?
I think the only team that has a chance in the East is Boston.
I think so too. Isaiah Thomas is putting on quite a performance.
What do you think about the Western Conference?
I'm a big fan of the San Antonio Spurs, but they're having a bit of trouble with the Houston Rockets.
How about the Golden State Warriors?
Hopefully the Spurs can give them a hard time. They're just such a good team.
How are you supposed to stop that team?
Especially since they picked up Kevin Durant in the off-season last year.
It's starting to look like another Finals rematch.
Yeah, I think in the end we're going to see the Warriors play the Cavaliers again.
Who do you think is gonna take it all?
I think the Warriors are gonna win this year.
How come?
I think if you compare the teams side by side, the Warriors are just better in almost every way.
I think LeBron can give them a run for their money. He's carried Cleveland before.
There's only one way to find out.
I can't wait for the Finals!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is this the last stand for the Cavaliers?
Why do you say that?
I dont know doesnt seem like they are built for the future.
As long as James is there they are fine.
Some of the guys may want to leave for bigger deals.
And then they shuffle in the next round.
Irving will be there but I dont know about JR Smith
Smith? Please, James gave him a career.
I will agree on that but I just think it might be over.
Its over when he leaves until then enjoy the ride.
Well as a Bulls fan I am not enjoying anything.
Yeah well hold tight cause its his league until otherwise.
Jimmy Butler has something to say.
Its just chatter, LeBron is better than him.
Yeah I subscribe to that.
What a time in the NBA though.
Not really its just a couple of good teams and everyone else.
This is true but I dont think for long.
The Warriors take over or may have taken over.
If Cleveland wins this year, they are the cream of the crop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello.
What's up?
Nothing, you?
Not much.  You into basketball?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you have a favorite team?
I guess I like the Knicks.
Ouch.
Why do you say that?
They're awful.
Well they are that.
Have you seen a game live?
No I never have but I want to.  You?
I've seen a few Wizards games.
Did you have fun?
Oh man it was great.
Cool, I should really try to see one.
You should.  Good talking to you.
Good talking to you too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the MVP race this year?
It's going to be close.  Harden or Westbrook probably, right?
Who do you think will win?
Well there are two questions here.  Who do I think will win, and who I think should win.
Okay, who do you think will win?
I think it will be James Harden.
Why Harden?
Well to be honest his individual numbers aren't that much worse than Westbrook, and his team had more success.
That is true.  And to some degree the MVP award does reward team success.
But I think Westbrook should win.
Do you think he should win because of his triple double average?
Yes, definitely.  This was a historic season that should be rewarded.
What do you think about the argument that he was just racking up stats for the sake of getting a triple double?
I think that's a silly argument.  Every player racks up stats to some degree.
That is true.  And it's not like it's easy just to get triple doubles, no matter how much you try to rack up stats.
Exactly.  Everyone would do it if it were that easy.
Ok, truthfully I think Kawhi Leonard should be MVP.
Interesting.  I mean I am sure he will get some votes.
I think he's the whole package.  Good player on both offense and defense, and his team has had success.
I guess you could argue what else would you want from an MVP, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How can you watch this stuff? It's so boring.
What? Basketball? It's am exciting game
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won the game?
The lake
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so sick of Lebron.
Yeah me too.  He just keeps crushing the terrible East.
Yeah like that is some huge accomplishment.
Yeah I mean Isiah Thomas at 5 foot 9 also has been killing the East.
Kind of shows you just how terrible the East is.
Yeah and soon Carmelo is going to head West too.
You think so?
Yeah he is going to end up on the Clippers I bet.
Oh! I like the idea of that. You think they will have to get rid of Blake?
Possibly, or at least Reddick.
Yeah I wonder where he will go then.
I hope he goes to Milwaukee to add some shooting.
Oh I love that idea too.  Riddick in Milwaukee would be fun.
Yeah that might make the East a little better too.
Well, I don't know about that.  The bucks seem fake to me.
Yeah I could see that but I think you are only saying that since you are a Chicago fan.
Don't get me started  on my dumpster fire.
What? You aren't happy with Butler?
Well, I just think he is over rated.
I could see that.  He definitely loves ISO ball too much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're telling me that a healthy San Antonio or Houston couldn't at least make the series competitive?
Houston vs. the Cavs would have been a great series, they battled every time they played.
Cavs fans will be in for a rude awakening when they get to the finals and realize that the Warriors aren't the Celtics.
All I'm saying is that the Warriors aren't going to leave Kyle Korver open for 3 every possession.
The Cavs are way too explosive in offense!! Before the series I thought it'll be Cavs at 5 but now it is clear it will be over after 4 games.
The celtics are not ready yet and i think no one can doubt it. There are obvious lags in rebounding.
The Celtics need to draft Fultz and move Thomas while his stock is high.
But can you imagine Fultz AND Thomas together?
The NBA is way to predictable. They need to implement a hard cap with no luxury tax.
Your right, Spread the talent around create parity and make the NBA competitive.
The thing that kills me is that Cleveland fans forgets that Lebron abandon them to win a ring with another team.
Jordan, Kobe, Duncan, Pierce NEVER abandon their teams to win a title..THEY played against the BEST because they wanted to be known as the BEST.
As much as I love the NBA I'm starting to find the games unwatchable. There's just no competition.
I agree, but I will still continue to watch....I just hope they make some changes.
I know its based on the record but HOW was Boston a #1 seed.
A #1 seed should NEVER lose by 50 points....that just isn't fathomable.
Celtics are nowhere near as talented as the elite teams, yet accomplished a lot.
Of course though, no respect is given. Wait till we see who they draft.
The Celtics already got what they wanted this season: Got a first seed, Made it to conference finals and got the first pick in the draft.
I would say this was a success, the only thing better would be a ring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Hawks organization is influx
Yeah they really are. Where do they go from here?
Milsap is got to be their top priority
Indeed. He is their best player
Yeah. I also like that kid Schroeder. He is going to be a superstar in this league
I don't know about superstar, but he will be a very good player
They need a couple of more pieces though
Yeah I agree with you. They have to add some shooters
Yeah, especially since they gave up Kyle Korver
I didn't understand that move at all
That's what I'm saying this organization didn't know whether to blow this team up or to try and win games
They went out and got Dwight Howard last year, I'm sure he doesn't want to be a part of a rebuilding project.
Exactly. When Howard's not happy he can taint a locker room
Yeah he's done that before. This is not a good look for the Hawks organization
It really isn't. No way any team takes on that massive Howard contract though.
I have to agree with you on that one. They are going to have to work around him.
At least he is still pretty good defensively. He still can defend the paint and he's a good rebounder
Yeah he is, but you can't go to him in the post
No you can't be he's been like that for a while now
Yeah, so they knew that when they signed him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It looks like it will be the Warriors and Cavaliers again in the NBA Finals this year.
Yeah, this is the third year in a row now.
It should be a good tie breaker. Who do you think wins?
It's tough to say, both are playing great basketball right now.
Definitely! The Cavalliers just beat the Celtics by like 40!
Yeah that was crazy.
I think Kevin Love will be the X factor for the Cavaliers this year. He was injured their first year and didn't play that great last year.
Yeah he will have to play well this time. It's going to be a tough match up against arguably the defensive player of the year, Draymond Green.
That's true. Now that the Warriors have Kevin Durant he will likely guard LeBron.
Yeah, and they still have Andre Igoudala off the bench to guard LeBron. He won't start this time.
I still don't think they can slow LeBron down, the guy is just too good.
Probably not but now he will have to guard Durant which will wear him down.
True, in previous years they didn't have to worry about Harrison Barnes offensively. But Durant is one of the best in the league.
Im more interested in the Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry matchup again.
Man Kyrie was insane last year. They had no answer for him, and the game winner in game 7 was beautiful.
Curry isn't known for his defense, I would expect more of the same this year.
That's where Klay Thompson will have to step up.
Yeah but he couldn't stop kyrie either last year.
Good point. I can't wait for the Finals to start!
Same here, only a couple of more weeks to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Spurs game last night?
No I did not.
It was amazing basketball.
Oh really, why is that?
Well not in the conventional sense.
Go on.
It was a defensive show.
Oh nobody likes to watch that.
Well some people do.
Okay it lacks the flashy offensive plays that make highlight reels.
Yes that is exactly correct.
Wow that Greg Popavic is amazing.
Yes he runs a defensive powerhouse.
He must be a genius.
Yes, and you should have seen the way Ginobili locked down his defenders.
Yes he usually opts to attack, harass and stick to them like glue.
Yes he is so great.
I want to watch him play like that.
You have to watch the playoffs, that is when they play harder.
Ok I will do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When is the draft?
Its June 22nd  at 7 EST.
Where is the draft again?
Brooklyn at the Barclays center.
Who do you think the Celtics will draft?
I know they WON'T draft Ball, they don't want that train wreck.
I can't believe the way Ball's dad is acting.
Oh I do, he's a spoiled child.
Does Markelle Fultz or Lonzo Ball have the edge on top of most draft boards?
Fultz by far, even if Ball is the better player- all the off the court issues are a MAJOR concern.
Do you think Curry would be a different player if he didn't stay in college?
I think he IS the player he is because he stayed, no he won't have the lifetime stats in the NBA but his NCAA experience has helped him so much.
Best big man of all time?
Its easy to say Shaq or Jabbar, but you also have to think of others like: Malone, or Ewing....can I pick 3.
Do you think Thomas has been playing with his hip strain for awhile now?
Yes, I do....I think his sisters death has effected him a lot but that shouldn't make him slower off the dribble like he has been the past few weeks.
Should the Celtics keep the #1 pick?
I'm torn, I think they could trade and get an established player but also I would love to see Fultz with this group of players.
Will Lebron beat Jordon's 30 point game streak?
I think so, especially now that he's playing with a chip on his shoulder due to the MVP voting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow dude did you see that Warriors Knicks game last night?
Lol I bet the Warriors won by 60.
Actually the Knicks were up for most of the game
On the Warriors?  Did their starters take the night off?
When I first looked at the score, I was thinking atleast 2 or 3 had to be resting but nah, only one was out with a strained hamstring.
The Knicks actually played defense?
I mean it seemed better than their norm, but they just can't stop any ball penetration. It was mainly just the Warriors building a house with all those bricks.
Hahaha
That one 7 footer for the Warriors missed 3 layups, was going full Moses Malone with the rebounds but missed 3 wide open chippies.
Hes 7 foot tall just dunk it with two hands...
To make it worse the Knicks got the rebound threw it up the floor and got a 4 point play from a 3 in the corner.
4 point play?
Yeah dude where you get fouled on a 3 and make it.
Oh, right...remember I'm still getting used to the 3 even being a thing as old as I am.
You're so dumb..anyways..so the Warriors ended up coming back from a 16 point deficit in the 4th...the Knicks looked tired
Yeah they have no bench, kind of their problem really.
It was hard to watch kind of...was man against boys out there with the Warriors just making every shot they looked at.
I know that feeling...they do that to my Bulls all the time.
So the moral of the story...you can play above your talent level for a while...but the Knicks will always be the Knicks.
I feel sad for New York.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Celtics can beat the Lebron?
No chance. They can push them to six games though.
I don't think any team is going to give the Cavs a game until Golden State.
Yeah, and even then I don't think Lebron and the Cavs have much of a chance.
Don't underestimate Lebron.
There's no way they can hang with the Warriors for 7 games.
Probably not. The Warriors have too much firepower.
Yeah, and the Cavs don't have any if it's not Lebron or Kyrie.
Do you think Lebron is the best player in the game?
Yeah, he still is, at least for one more year.
Next year I think Kawhi overtakes him as the best.
He keeps getting better every year.
I know. I hope he shuts down Durant in the upcoming series.
I do too. I think San Antonio can win 1 or 2 games.
Even if Kawhi shuts down Durant, Steph and Klay will score at will.
That's why nobody will beat Golden State.
There are 4-5 guys on the team that could be number one options elsewhere.
Most teams are lucky if they have two of those types of players. The Warriors have 4.
And some teams don't even have one.
But if your team has one, and he's the best player in the world, don't count them out yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many points did Durant end up scoring in game 3?
I believe he ended up with 33.
Do you think the Celtics will match up better without Thomas playing?
I think they might because they can't rely on him all the time and someone will have to step up.
Would you have ever thought we would be in the conference finals and still have two undefeated teams?
Never, one maybe but not two.
Do you think either team and finish up and run the table 16-0?
No, because eventually they will have to run into each other and it will be a battle.
Do you feel the series would be different if Leonard never got hurt?
Of course it would be, he was a first team candidate all season long.
What was Curry's stats for game 3?
He end up 21 points and three 3-pointers.
How many points did Rick Barry have before Curry passed him in game three?
1,776 Curry is sitting at 1,795 .
The problem the Spurs have is you can't win when you allow the other teams starting 5 to be so dominate.
Your right, all 5 of the Warriors starters scored in double figures.
What was the turning point of the game, in your mind?
I think the biggest "rush" was when Durant went on a 19 point surge throughout the 3rd quarter.
Are you excited for another almost inevitable classic of GS vs. Cleveland?
Oh yeah! Bring on round 3!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see last night's basektball game?
I did. I thought the Spurs were going to win.
I thought they were going to win also until that guy got hurt.
Who was it that got hurt? I didn't see the play.
It was the big guy that plays center, David Lee.
Oh! What happened to him?
He was going up for a shot and he landed on some guys foot, hurting his ankle. Do you know how many points he had?
I heard he had ten points. What about Durant? DId you see him?
Yeah, he was amazing with all of those rebounds.
And he had 30 points and 10  assists in the second half.
No one on the Spurs could guard him.
What do you think are the Spurs chances of winning the series?
I don't think they will win the series, I don't know if they will win one game.
So it will be another Warriors/Cavs finals?
Yes! for sure. I think the outcome will be different from last year.
So you think the Warriors will win it all?
Definitely! They have much better players now
I think you are right.
Warriors in 6 games.
I think the Cavs will win in 7.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who has the best uniform in the NBA?
I like the Celtics uniform a lot.
Yeah, that's a classic.
I think the Bulls have nice uniforms as well.
I really like the black alternate uniform the Bulls have.
I think the Lakers uniforms are overrated.
What do you mean?
I think the gold and purple colors look pretty cheesy. We've just become used to it.
I can kind of understand that. Those colors are pretty bold.
It's also really funny that they kept the Lakers name even after the team moved from Minnesota.
Yeah, there are a couple even more extreme examples of that sort of thing.
Right. The Utah Jazz and the Memphis Grizzlies come to mind.
Utah isn't exactly known for pumping out great jazz music.
And when's the last time anyone saw a grizzly bear in Tennessee?
I guess it's a little too late to change the names now though.
Yeah. They've been able to make it work I guess.
The Grizzlies were originally from Vancouver, right?
Yeah I believe so.
I wonder if Canada will ever have another NBA team besides the Raptors?
I don't know, but I think it would be pretty cool if they did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will coach the Knicks next season?
They will probably keep Hornacek.
Will Carmelo Anthony be on the team next year?
I think he will ask for a trade to a team that could contend for a championship.
Which team will draft Lonzo Ball?
I've herd that the LA Lakers will draft him.
Will Lonzo Ball's father be a distraction for his NBA career?
It's very likely, hopefully Magic Johnson can deal with him.
Will the Golden State Warriors make it to the NBA finals this year?
It looks like they wlll beat the Spurs.
Will Cleveland beat the Boston Celtics to make it to the NBA finals?
Yes, they should be able to beat them easily.
Could Cleveland win if Kyrie Irving wasn't on the team?
I don't think so, he's an important guard on the team.
Will Draymond Green be able to keep his temper in check?
Hopefully he can because Golden State needs him.
Will LeBron James retire if Cleveland wins again this year?
I think he will play for at least 2 more years.
Who will be the number one pick of the NBA draft this year?
Some people predict it will be Markelle Fultz.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you see the basketball game last night?
Yeah, not good.
The refs were terrible
they missed some really important call
I really hope the refs call a fair game tomorrow
They sure couldn't do any worse
The Balsac's sure could have shot better
You have to admit Mentsrals played played some pretty good defence
Yeah I agree DiaPHramn played one hell of a game
Yeah nothing was getting past D
I think Pen is going to have a good strong gave and will play hard
I agree he looked a little limp last night
Yeah I think Coach V will really get him up for tomorrows game
Yeah I heard a rumor that he has a new strategy for tomorrow,
I hadn't heard that Yeah what is the new strategy?
Instead of the Triangle Offense hes going to use what he call 4 Play offense
Wow sounds interesting do you how how it works?
Yeah you move the ball around and try to make as much contact with defender to get them to open up
Sounds like good strategy to me for our sake's I hope it works
Yeah my guess is if does work the whole league will adopt it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Wade is playing on the Bulls now?
Yes I noticed.
He is from there.
Yes I think thats great.
Yes he helped out that city by giving money to the needy.
And Lebron plays for his hometown team too.
Yes it adds an extra element of meaning in the NBA.
Yes it directly addresses what people say makes college ball better.
Yes its not entirely about the money.
Yes there is some pride and geographical or logistics involved that is meaningful.
I wish every player had to do that.
Yes that would be funny.
It would certainly change things.
The player must have chosen to reside in a particular city to play there.
That is an interesting idea.
Yes it is.
I'm sure that is a factor in the draft negotiation process.
Yes it probably is.
There is a lot that goes into what makes the NBA so great.
Yes it is the best basketball league in the world.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow! The Cavs are doing really good.
I know.  "Defend the land".
They just beat Toronto.
And in only 4 games!
They make it seem so easy.
It might look easy but II am sure it isn't really that easy.
I wonder who they will play next.
Time will tell.  We have to wait to find out.
Who do you think will be in the final game?
Cleveland, for sure!
And who will they play?
I do not know.  I hope it isn't Golden State.
Well, I think it will be Golden State.
A repeat of last year!
Another championship for Cleveland!
That would be great!
That means another championship parade.
Let's plan to go to the parade!
Go Cavs!!!
Go Cavs!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Kevin Durant was on fire last night. Did you see the game?
Nah. My mother-in-law came over and we all went out to dinner.
You missed a decent game, bro.
How many points did Durant score?
16 points in less than 3 minutes.
Not too shabby.
Yeah, I like to call him a 'stealth scorer'.
You trademarked that?
Haha. Not yet.
So how many points did he end up with?
33. That 16 was during the third quarter.
I saw the recap on the news. The Warriors are about to sweep the Spurs.
It looks that way. It's a bit disappointing, though.
How come?
I prefer close games, especially during the playoffs.
Not a fan of blowouts, huh?
Never have been. It's like, no contest.
Who knows. Maybe the Spurs will turn it around and tie-up the series.
That would be awesome, but I doubt it'll happen.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know basketball was invented entirely in the US?
Yes, In Springfield.MA.
Yep. I used to live there.
No kidding.
Nope. I went to Classical High back in the day. They changed that to Central high. That was back in 1986.
Did you play basketball?
No. But I guess I was a fan. It was well known that Basketball was invented there, so it was pretty competitive to get on the team.
I can imagine.
There's a museum dedicated to it.
I heard, I wanna go check it out soemtime.
It first began because it was cold and rainy but Dr Naismith wanted to keep his physical ed class active.
That was, what? Back in 1900s?
1891. December. he wanted a game that will keep students occupied during the cold winter months. And it gets COLD in Springfield.
Interesting.
The very first basket was made from hanging or nailing a peach basket to the wall at 10 ft height.
Huh.
That proved a stupid idea, because you have to climb up to retrieve the ball every time someone makes the basket.
Haha, that does seem kinda silly. They should've removed the bottom.
And that's exactly what they did. Ball would get stuck, and they would use a stick to poke it over and out of the basket.
That's still dumb, they should've attached a net or something to let you see the ball went into the basket and allow the ball to fall through.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Lebron is going to win the NBA Championship this year?
I am not sure, I do not think the Cavs have enough good players around him.
Yeah, but they added Kyle Korver and have been shooting threes great.
That is the key if they can shoot well I think Lebron can win another championship.
More threes than the Golden State Warriors at least.
You think the Warriors will make it to the Finals?
Yeah I think the Spurs will lose to the Rockets, and the Rockets cant beat the Warriors even with James Harden.
I would love to see that Western Conference Final of Harden against Curry.
Who do you think is the better 3pt shooter?
I definitely think Steph Curry is the best shooter in the game.
You think he will do better this year in the Finals if they play the Cleveland Cavaliers again?
Yeah that was a fluke for Curry to play that poorly last year.
I know I still cannot believe that they lost after being up 3 to 1 in the series.
That was an epic comeback from the Cavaliers to be able to do it.
There is no way that even with Lebron they come back without Kyrie Irving.
I agree Kyrie Irving was the most important and valuable player in that series.
If he plays like that again I think the Cavaliers would beat the Warriors in the Finals.
Not if Curry and Thompson play at the same level, the Warriors have to many weapons to only the Cavs Lebron and Kyrie.
Yeah but Lebron is like three of the Warriors players, he is the best in the world.
I agree he is the best in the world, if they play in the finals again it will be a great match.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NBA games frequently?
Yes, I am a big fan of LA Lakers. How about you?
I like Golden Warriors. What is your opinion about it?
Well, it leads the league but I do not like it.
Why don't you like Warriors?
It is unbeatable, and it has several players which can be top 10 of the league. I do not like to see them playing in the same team.
I understand, but don't think watching Warrior's games is so fun?
Maybe, but I feel sorry for other teams which play again them, They become so weak.
Not really. Do you know that Warriors was defeated by Caveliers last year in the NBA final?
I watched the finals. King James is King!
Are you a fan of King James?
Not really though. If King James can join Lakers, I would become a big fan.
I do not believe that would be true.
Why do you think so?
Well, LeBron James is turnning 32 this year. Lakers has no hope to win the championship in the next few years.
But Lakers is located in LA. I know many players want to be part of LA Lakers.
There are two teams in LA.
Clippers? Well, I am not a fan at all.
I see. Lakers is in your heart.
Exactly, and I am willing to see Lakers to go to the NBA finals again in the next few years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Good, you?
Not bad.
Good.  Do you like basketball?
I do.
Cool me too.
Who is your favorite player?
Lebron of course.
Ah, I should have known.
Yeah, he's the king.
I like Steph.
He is great too.
It will be cool to see them play in the finals.
If they both get there.
Yeah of course, but it sure looks like they will meet up again.
The Celtics might stop them.
I don't think so.
We'll see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to the game Friday night?
What game?
The Cardinals game!  They're playing the Hawks.
I don't know, I was thinking about it but it kinda depends if Jimmy goes.
They're supposed to win this time.
Who's supposed to win?
The cardinals.
Oh...Have they been having a good season?
Well, not really.  Since they lost Wilkins it's been kinda downhill.
Wait, they lost Wilkins?  How did that happen?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the NBA playoffs this year?
Sort of, but it hasn't been very interesting yet.
I know.  The Celtics might as well just stay home.
They must be dreading the next game.  How embarrassing!
I used to really like watching the Celtics back when Larry Byrd played.  I guess that was 30 years ago or more.
Me too because my ex-husband was a huge Celtics fan. His whole family loved anything IRISH!
The NBA seemed so much more interesting back then.  Have we changed or has the NBA changed?
Well, I know my love for sports hasn't changed, so maybe it's the NBA.
That was back when the OTHER Isaiah Thomas played for the Pistons. But I think his name was spelled differently.
But I heard he IS named after the Pistons' Isaiah. I think because his father lost a bet or something like that, and then his mother changed the spelling.
I got interested in the NBA again last year when I saw Seth Curry making so many 3 pointers. I would tune in just to see how many he made.
He definitely made it entertaining.
I guess it will be Golden State and the Cavaliers again this year in the finals.
You're right.  If not I would be shocked.
Which team would you want to win?
I guess I would want Golden State this year.  I'm getting a little bored with LeBron.
He sure is great though.
Really I just hope they are good games.  I miss the old days when I really cared!
I am going to watch the next Celtics game.  I'm just curious if they can even compete.
It's kind of like watching a train wreck!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about this years playoffs?
Eh, not that good.
Why don't you think so? Its okay
Eh, just no real competition.
Yea, you do have a point about that. Lots of blowouts are happening.
Yea, the Celtics are the best team in the East and look at them.
Well, "best" is relative.
What do you mean?
Well, we all know the Cavaliers are better.
Well, they do have the best player in the world.
Yea, that helps a little bit, but Kyrie doesn't hurt either.
Even the West has no competition though.
What am I gonna watch? The spurs lose by 40?
Yea, that isnt usual for them.
Who can beat Golden State for 48 minutes 4 times out of 7?
Nobody, thats the problem.
Then why watch is my argument.
Yea, I completely agree with that one.
We just need more competition next year.
That we do. We'll see what happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Warriors play last night?
Yes, it was an awesome game!
Even better to see it in person.
What?! You were there?
Yes! Up in the nosebleeds, but the atmosphere was awesome.
That's amazing, especially to be there for a playoff game.
Yeah. I always thought Steph, Klay, and KD were fun to watch on TV, but it is nothing like seeing it in person.
I can only imagine. I forgot, how many points did Steph end up with last night? I know he's been in a slump.
Well he broke out of that slump last night. He finished with 38.
That's right! And Klay had 42, right?
Yes, and add in Durant's 34 and you had quite the trifecta.
Getting Durant in the off-season was such a good move for them.
I know! I'd take him over Bogut hands down.
Yeah, I was wishy-washy on him. I miss Barbossa though.
He could come in at clutch moments, but I'd still take KD.
Oh, definitely. He really helps pick the team up if Klay and Steph are off.
He does. But on an "off" night you are still getting 28 points, I mean how bad can it be?
Very true! It looks like we may have a Warriors/Cavs rematch this year for the championship.
I hope so! That would be one heck of a series.
Yes! Let's hope the Warriors don't blow it again this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Should the NBA realign?
Just have one big league?
No just go into a conference?
So eliminate division winners?
Yes that way seeding would be correct
Yeah I think thats the way it should be
Wow we agree on something.
Yeah I think the emphasis on winning the division doesnt matter anymore.
If a team is good home court shouldnt matter?
I mean that in a way where its not important as you think
So we overvalue home court?
I think so.
Thats pretty different.
I think thats a pretty good observation.
Yeah you can see where the league is headed no one has an advantage.
The Cavaliers could win on any court
Thats why they didnt care about regular season wins.
Wouldnt it matter in the Finals?
They should flip a coin ever year
Or have it rotate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Minnesota Lynx win last night?
No, I don't watch women's basketball.  It's boring.
Are you kidding me?  So have you ever even seen them play?
No, why would I watch them?  Women are so much less aggressive and can't make shots
They are more skilled than you think.  You should give them a chance.  Watch a game.
Meh.  Maybe I'll turn it on for a few minutes next time.  When's the next game.
I'm not sure.  They don't always televise them.  Watching live in person is better anyway.
Why is that?
The Lynx have an amazing fan base and the energy they bring to the court is fantastic.
Where do they play?
They usually play at Target Center, but this year they are playing at Xcel because Target Center is being remodeled.
Target Center is a way better place to watch a basketball game.
I completely agree.  I can't wait until they're back there hitting threes!
Who do you think is their best player?
They've got so many great players it's hard to pick just one.  I'd probably say Maya Moore.  She's so talented.
Oh yeah?  I think I've heard of her.  Who else?
Lindsey Whalen.  Simone Augustus.  Syliva Fowles.
Why are the scores so low compared to men's basketball?
Well, the games are shorter, for one.  Also the women are a little shorter than a lot of male basketball players, so the men have it a little easier in that regard.
Oh, I see.  I didn't know the games were shorter.  Good to know.  I may just have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you able to see game 3 between the Warriors and Jazz?
Yes, the Jazz lost the game.
Who led the Warriors in points?
Durant scored 38 points.
Wow, who was the Jazz's leading scorer?
Hayward poured in 29 points for the Jazz.
Which player led the Warriors in assists?
Draymond Green had 5 assists for the Warriors.
Okay, which player led the Jazz in assists?
Hayward had 6 assists for the Jazz.
Which Warriors player got the most rebounds?
Durant had 13 rebounds for the Warriors.
Conversely, which player on the Jazz had the most rebounds?
Rudy Gobert had 15 rebounds for the Jazz.
How many threes did the Warriors make?
The Warriors made 9 three pointers.
How many three pointers did the Jazz make?
The Jazz made 7 three pointers.
Lastly, what was the final score between the two clubs?
The Warriors scored 102 points while the Jazz made 91 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the Celtics and Wizards series?
Yeah, it's been pretty incredible so far.
Who do you think is going win?
I think the Celtics will take it in seven games.
I hope they do but the Wizards have been pretty tough the past few games.
Yeah they have. But Boston has home court advantage.
Yeah all the games have been won by the home team this series.
What do you think about Kelly Oubre getting suspended?
I think he deserved it. It was a bad choice to push Olynyk like that.
Yeah, he should have just backed off.  The pick was hard but legal.
Do you think either team stands a chance against the Cavaliers next round?
I don't know. I think they might win a game or two but the Cavaliers are really good.
Yeah, The Celtics would have home court in that series, do you think that would make a difference.
Yeah a slight one but I still think the Cavaliers would win.
Who do you think is gonna come out of the West?
I think the Warriors for sure.
I think the Rockets could possibly beat the Warriors but probably not.
Yeah. I think the Spurs are too old and too injured to keep winning in the playoffs.
Yeah. I had them winning this series with the Rockets but now I'm not sure.
We'll see in the next few days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the basketball playoffs at all?
Yeah! The Cavaliers swept the Raptors.
The Cavaliers will probably end up playing Boston.
You think so?
Yeah. I don't think the Wizards can beat Boston.
I think they can, the series is still pretty close.
The problem is, all Boston has to do is win one more game and then they advance.
Yeah, that is true, do you think it will go to game 7?
Probably not. I think the Wizards will lose to Boston in game 6.
That sucks man, I know that the Wizards are your team.
Yeah, but I think the Cavaliers will definitley beat Boston.
I think so, too. I think Boston is overrated.
Who do you think will win the whole thing?
I am almost positive Golden State will.
Yeah, I think so too. They are just too good.
I wonder how long they will be this good?
I am not sure. I mean if Curry continues to play for them they could be the Patriots of the NBA.
Yeah, I agree. We'll have to see.
We should watch the finals together. I'll text you later about it.
Okay, sounds good. Talk to you later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Porzingis long for New  York?
I mean he should be.
I cant believe theres talk of trading him
The franchise in disarray
I am shocked that Phil Jackson doesnt have a better hold on it.
He is a better coach than personnel guy.
I think thats evident.
I do not know what they are going to do.
Will they be competitive soon
Not when stuff like this happens.
I mean Kristaps fell to them and they are bungling that.
I think the Anthony situation did alot of damage.
To the coach or who?
To the organization as a whole
Guys dont want to be in that dysfunction.
Nope and we can see it playing out right now.
Yeah I think that its the end of the line for them.
They need to bring in a big named coach
And trade Melo?
Yeah he has to be the first move
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of basketball?
Yeah, I am.
Oh, did you used to play?
Yeah when I was a kid.
Were you any good?
Yeah, I was. I used to play against older people.
Cool! Did you watch the NBA?
Yup, a lot.
Who was your favorite team?
The Detroit Pistons
Seriously? Didn't they suck back then?
No! They had a young Grant Hill who was awesome.
You mean the washed up guy with all those ankle problems on the Suns?
Yeah, but he was totally different back then.
How so?
They used to call him the next Michael Jordan.
No way...
Seriously. He was the next big thing. He was awesome at Duke too
Ugh, Duke...
Yeah, I hate them too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like talking basketball.
Yeah, me too.
So, you been watching the games much?
Well, I tried to keep up with Notre Dame, but they're not doing so great.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, they lost four of their last five games, including two at home to two ranked teams
Wow, that's not very good.
No, it isn't, and it's pretty discouraging as a big fan of the team.
Can't be all hopeless, though, huh?
Well, Mooney isn't doing to bad.  Been pretty excited to see him on the floor.
Yeah, I've seen him, that guy is TALL, even for a basketball player.
Yeah, I believe he's like six foot nine or so.
Well, could definitely catch some rebounds.
That's for sure.
Maybe they need a change in strategy.
Yeah, I think so... heard some people suggesting they try the 1-4 offensive set
You think that would work?
At this point, it couldn't hurt but that, to me, isn't the real problem.
What is?
I think they keep passing on "good" shots to try and get "even better" shots.  Sometimes, you just gotta cut loose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your top 5 NBA players right now?
I got LeBron, KD, Kawai, Curry and Westbrook
What about Harden? He's the MVP and he can't make your top 5?
First, he's not the MVP, it's Westbrook. Second, his stats are inflated because of the system.
He's getting triple doubles left and right and he led his team to the third seed. It doesn't matter the system those are MVP credentials.
Are you kidding me the Rockets just let him the hog the ball every possession. It's easy to get stats like that.
You are crazy trying to tell me that Harden isn't the MVP because he's a ball hog then turn around and say the ultimate ball hog, Westbrook, is the MVP!
Westbrook has to do it because his team sucks, there's no one else who they can rely on to get a shot on offense.
What about Kanter and Olidipo
Olidipo is inconsistent at best and Kanter doesn't even start.
Who does Harden have then?
Gordon, Lou Williams, Ariza, Ryan Anderson
Ok fine but Harden beats Westbrook in win shares, points per game and is more efficient on offense.
Westbrook is averaging a triple double and Harden is not. Case closed.
Look Harden's the MVP because he's the best player in a contender and Westbrook is the best player on an average team.
The MVP should be the best player on any team, Not the best player on the top teams, it's not very fair.
You sound crazy, you shouldn't even be allowed to talk about basketball.
Really? Ok who is your top 5 then?
LeBron, KD, Kawai, Curry and Westbrook
That's the same as mine. I hate you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Well, you?
Not bad.  You a basketball fan?
Yes I am.
Who is your team?
I like the Celtics.
Cool.  I like the Cavs.
Oh I see.
Yeah it looks like we might might you guys in the semis.
It does look like that.
I think we're going to get you guys though.
We will see!
Lebron will dominate.
We have the answer for lebron.
I don't think so.
Guess we're going to find out.
May the best team win.
agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best player ever?
Hmm, maybe Wilt Chamberlin.
What about Michael Jordan?
Only won six championships.
Wilt wasn't really that great, just really tall.
That's part of basketball, you just gotta score.
Lebron is better than Wilt.
No way, Lebron has lost in the finals a lot.
Yeah, but his teams sucked. Lebron in the early years had terrible teams.
Wilt scored 100 points in a game.
Players today are really more athletic, and defenses are alot better.
Well ok, who do you think is going to win this year?
It's going to be the Cavs, Lebron is the best player in the league right now.
Warriors have 3 of the top 5 players, they'll win.
Lebron can take over a game all by himself.
I think the Warriors will be able to play as a team and outscore Lebron.
Did you see the cavs vs Boston? They dominate them.
Warriors won the most game and are undefeated in the playoffs.
Spurs were beating on them until Kawhai got injured.
I don't know, I still think the Warriors will win
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Markelle Fultz that much better than everyone?
I'm not sure Lonzo Ball seems pretty good too.
Yea, I just don't know much about those top guys.
I know Lonzo Ball has a crazy dad.
He sure has that. What is with that guy?
I don't know man. He's a little too confident in his kid.
Just a little bit. Its ridiculous.
Yea, I agree. I feel bad for the kid.
I don't. He's about to get paid.
Yea, he is in a big way, but I don't know if he will live up to it.
We'll you never know with these guys. You just cant.
That is true. Its all a gamble.
Yea, thats why its called a draft.
I agree. Hopefully the top 3 at least are gamers.
Yea, we will find out in about a month.
Yea, about that. I just hope the sixers get a good player.
They should at number 3.
Yea, no Fultz, but thats okay.
Seems like the top ten is pretty good.
Yea, but usually a few don't pan out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you see the Nets  ever getting back to success?
In what respect?
Perennial playoff contenders.
Geez its tough to envision that right now.
Is Billy King the worst GM Ever?
I mean theyre trades really hampered them.
If losing the pick to the Celtics wasnt enough.
They lost next years pick too.
Thats what I am saying.
Not sure how you overcome that.
Its going to be a long rebuild for them.
Do you think theyll weather the storm?
No, theyll be bad for years to come
Over a decade?
Itll probably take that long.
Unless they can get free agents.
Yeah but thats not how the NBA works anymore
Sure it does.
No you have to draft some of your guys.
I dont think you have to
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Warriors and Cavs sure are dominating the playoffs so far.
Yeah, nobody has been a challenge, they've both won every game so far.
I guess the rest paid off for Lebron.
Yeah, he's as dominant in these playoffs as ever before.
What about Durant? Looks like the warriors made a good move in picking him up.
Yeah, seems like he was worth giving up some of the depth they had.
They still have some good role players. Javale Magee is playing great.
Yeah, he's great on the boards and I love when he dunks those lobs.
David West has been giving the Warriors good minutes lately too.
Yeah, well, seems like they just have too much talent to lose this year.
True, even if Curry or Thompson aren't playing well Durant and Green can take over the game.
Yeah, it helps that Durant doesn't rely on the three as much.
Cleveland made some good acquisitions this year as well.
Yes, Korver and Williams have become a major part of their regular rotation.
Korver had 18 points in the last game against the Raptors.
Yeah, signing Bogut didn't work out too well though.
No, can't believe he broke his leg right away. I think they're still set up pretty well though.
Yeah, it's hard to imagine anyone can stop either the Cavs or the Warriors.
No, especially since the other teams look like they could both be in seven game series.
Yeah, once they advance, the Cavs and Warriors will be waiting and well rested.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Free throw shooting is terrible in the league anymore
Why do you think that happened
Guys dont care about shooting
That cant be true
Sure it is, look how many guys just drive the lane
Then you have guys like Steph Curry
OK and thats one guy
I see where you are trying to corner me
Not that, its just hes one example out of 150 you can come up with.
Well its important to know theres no way guys cant shoot.
Teams are always searching for shooters.
I think the Sixers are example one of that.
Yeah they need a scorer but more importantly a scoring guard
I have seen Embiid throw up 3s
I am sure the team hates that
He can get back on defense quicker
But then you have your guards trying to rebound.
If theres a better method tell me
Thats not what I am here to do.
Well the NBA needs better shooters I can say that
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are the Spurs the best ever?
Like as a team or a franchise or what?
I mean like all around.
Well theyve been doing this for 20 years so theyre the current dynasty.
Change the players, dont change the winning.
Its amazing in todays world.
So are they the best dynasty ever?
I dont know the Celtics and Lakers won alot more.
Different time, not as many teams.
Yeah so the teams were better and more stacked.
True but the Celtics just won year after year.
This is true but the Spurs have won in an era that has one and done mega stars.
Yeah I just dont see it.
Think about it, the Spurs havent created a 3 man team like the Cavaliers and Warriors.
The Warriors drafted all their guys much like the Spurs.
Yeah Cleveland and Miami and Boston all did it with free agency.
So are you ready to crown the Spurs.
Once they win 5 in a row.
Could they beat MJs Bulls?
Never, he was the GOAT!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to see a rematch in the Finals?
Not really. I would rather it be Spurs and Wizards.
Hate LeBron that much?
I just am bored with Warriors and Cavaliers
The NBA needs a rivalry like this.
They do but I hate these superstar teams that has become the NBA.
I think that if you go passed that, its good for the NBA
Not really because if youre a team that is middling, you can never be great.
Sure you can, go through Free Agency.
Well if you have an owner that does not like to spend.
Well then he or she shouldnt be owning a team.
The goal is to win championships.
Yeah and that cost money at times.
I agree with most of what you are saying.
So say its Wizards and Spurs. Who do you want?
Spurs just to have Pop show he can win with anyone.
He might be the best coach of all time.
I dont know hes definitely up there though.
I would like to see him coach the 76ers.
Even he couldnt do that, he is not Jesus.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the Celtics player?
Yeah, he is out for the rest of the season.
Wanna go to the bar and watch the NBA finals?
Sorry,m hanging with my girl tonight.
Who is your favorite NBA team?
Oh, it is easily the Chicago Bulls.
Do you like college basketball?
Not really, I like the NBA more.
Did you see the basketball game last night?
Yeah, it was pretty intense!
Will you come to the game with me tonight? It is my old high school.
Sure, I like watching high school basketball.
Who do you think is going to win the NBA finals?
I dont know who is playing.
Who is your favorite NBA player?
Oh thats easy, LeBron James.
Micheale Jordan was the best basketball player ever.
You wont hear me argue!
How much do you like basketball?
It is my favorite sport!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been keeping up with the playoffs?
Yes, somewhat who do you think will win it all?
I like the cavaliers chances a lot, with lebron its just hard to count them out.
Yes thats true, but the warriors may have even more power seeing that they just added kevin durant.
Yea, true that was a crazy move by them they have like three stars now it's crazy.
That's true it seems like lebron is better at getting his group motivated.
True, I believe the warriors gelled pretty well though seeing that they made it to the playoffs.
I think they did as well but we are yet to see how they can come together on a big stage.
Yea thats true, also lebron has most of the people he won a championship with back for this run.
Yes, and they all have experience with winning the championship so I believe it will be less nerves.
That is true, Steph has a lot of experience with this too as well as his teammates.
Yea, but kevin durant has not even been to a championship before so how do you think he will fair?
I didn't think about that, he has usually choked in the playoffs so hopefully he can get it together.
I don't think he will, I believe if they do win it all he will have to get carried by the team.
I hope not, that would be a big embarrassment, I believe he will be able to turn it on if it came down to it.
Maybe he will, Draymond Green does hold him accountable they have been seen getting into arguements on the sideline.
Oh yea! I saw that, yea he is not having it this looks like it will be a good championship if they are both in it.
Definitely, I can't wait how many games do you think it will go to?
It would be very surprising if its a sweep, I see it going seven games.
Yea, I hope it does I know I will not want it to end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch that game last night between the San Antonio Spurs and the Golden State Warriors?
Of course, I wouldn't have missed it.
Game 3 of the series is pretty big one.
Yeah, with the Spurs being down 0-2 in the series this one was cruicial for them.
They really needed this win to stay alive, but it just wasn't happening for them.
The Warriors were just too good!
Did you see Durant last night?
Sure did! He was on fire!
I think he ended up with 33 points. He was hitting everything!
Don't forget the 10 rebounds he got too.
I think injuries were what got the Spurs.
Yeah, with Leonard out, they were hurting.
Popovich said Leonard wasn't playing but I wasn't sure.
Me too. I was hoping it was just talk.
Then Lee went down in the first quarter.
I know! He came down hard on that left knee and didn't come back.
Well, I guess game 4 could possibly finish the series for them.
Not sure if the Spurs can come back from this.
Looks like it's probably going to be the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Round 3.
Wonder how that will turn out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Chris what is up you been watching the playoffs.
Nah man i am bummed cause i was supposed to go but i cannot go now.
Why were you not able to go
My car broke down so no way there now.
You should still watch them the first game was Lit.
What do you mean by Lit?
It was exciting i nearly fell of my chair
Well you put it that was i might want to watch it.
Most definitely you need to watch it!
Can i come by next game and we throw a little party?
I might do that it would be awesome to have a ball game party.
I know right it would be cool as i have not watched the playoffs yet it will be exciting
What all would you want to do?
Just make some food and have some drinks and have a good time.
Sure sounds sweet man
When is the next playoff game?
It is next Tuesday
Perfect i am off that night.
Lets do it then will be a awesome time.
Sure will be perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe these NBA playoffs.
What about them?
All the favorites are winning.
Yeah, it's been blowout city.
Do you think the Spurs even had a chance with Leonard playing?
I don't think they did.
Neither do I. The Warriors are just too good.
I know. They have four all stars in their starting line up alone!
It's insane. Maybe the best team ever?
I guess you could make the argument.
Think the Cavs can give them a run for their money in the Finals?
Maybe. They're also playing lights out.
It should be interesting. Lebron is an amazing player.
He sure is. Single handely beat the Celtics himself the other night.
What a blowout that game was is.
Yeah. 72-31 at the half!
I couldn't believe it. So embarrasing.
Yeah. NBA just needs the Finals to happen already.
Want to have a NBA Finals watch party?
Sure! That'd be awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Rockets are going to win the Finals this year.
There is no chance of that.
Why do you say that?
Because the Spurs exist.
They are going to flip this series and come back.
Even if they do they have to beat the Warriors.
I think Durant is going to go down again and leave the window open for the Rockets.
Even if that does happen the Warriors would still beat the Rockets.
No way their bench is too weak.
OK, lets say I agree.  What about the Cavs?
Well I think Lebron is wearing down.
What tells you that? He has been the most dominant player in the playoffs clearly.
Maybe, OK now I am just getting depressed.
I didn't mean to do that but speaking of worn down have you seen Harden lately.
Hey hey! Never doubt the beard.
I am doubting the beard.  He looks exhausted.
Yeah his usage is way too high.
Exactly.
OK so maybe I'm over confident.
Maybe, you are 100% over confident.  No chance they win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Are you watching the NBA Playoffs?
Yeah, I am!
Who are you watching?
I have been watching the Spurs series and the Celtics series.
Oh yeah? Me too!
The Celtics and Wizards have had an awesome round so far.
Yeah, the Celtics are a bit of an underdog.
Yeah, I don't think people will think they have a chance against the Cavs if they make it to that round.
Yeah, that's true.
I am still rooting for them though!
I am rooting for them too! Especially for Isiah Thomas.
That guy has been so amazing even though he has gone through a lot of rough times.
It was so sad to hear about his little sister dying in that car crash.
Yeah she was so young.
It's amazing that he was able to get up and play after she died.
Yeah, he is becoming a sort of legend in the NBA right now.
I think he only can only go up from here.
It will be fun to see how high his star rises during the rest of the games and for the next season.
I hope the Celtics take it all all the way to the championship!
Me too! Go Boston!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite basketball player?
Michael Jordan is my favorite basketball player.
Who do you think Lebron James is better than Michael Jordan?
I think Michael Jordan is the greatest of all time, but Lebron could one day become one of the best to have ever played.
Do you think the Golden State Warriors are the best team in the league right now?
With Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, they are probably the best overall team this year.
Do you think Lebron James will make it to the finals again this year?
If his team stays healthy, it looks like they will make it to finals again to most likely face the Warriors.
Do you think Steph Curry is a better shooter than Lebron James?
Steph Curry seems to be a better three point shooter, but Lebron is an unstoppable scorer.
Do you think the Warriors are a super team that can't be beat?
The Warriors have a lot of great players, but Lebron James and the Cavs beat them last year.
Do you think Lebron James is still the best player in the NBA?
Lebron James is probably the best overall player in the league at the moment.
Do you think Lebron will surpass Michael Jordan as a player?
If he stays healthy and continues to play on championship teams, he has a chance.
Are you excited about the playoffs this year?
Not to much.  Waiting for the Warriors versus the Cavs in the finals.
Do you think the Warriors will beat the Cavs with the addition of Durant to their team?
If Durant stays healthy, the Warriors are a very tough team to beat.  I think the Warriors will probably win the championship this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't care about LeBron.
You and every hot-taker.
I literally don't.
No.
I literally, literally don't care about it.
He's a good player.
He stinks.
What?
He stinks bad.
He kills.
He's lame.
The man slays. He owns.
I just don't care for him.
He's always dynamic.
Hahaha.
I'm serious.
He's not.
He's always doing something new .
He's literally not.
He's a good player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There, there. what was THAT call about?
Hang on. Let me see. Oh, it's a double dribble.
Double dribble. What kinda rule is that?
This is an NBA game and we get a double dribble call. ridiculous.
Ok. So what is it?
You can only use one hand when dribbling. If you use both hands to touch the ball, and don;t shoot but go back to dribbling, that's called a double dribble.
So what happens now?
Well, the ball goes to the opposing team at where the penalty occurred.
Well, that sucks
This wasn't even intentional, If you look at Hinrich right before the call, he fumbles the ball and drops it and accidentally touches it with both hands.
Yeah it looks like he tripped or something.
When they miss the calls is when you get really pissed
like what?
Like, when the referees missed that same double dribble call on Johnson during raptors and trail blazers game
And they didn't call it?
Forget not calling they didn't even notice. It was a ridiculously obvious too.
Well that sucks.
Wait until you catch traveling call in the NBA.
What's that?
Traveling is when a palyer carries the ball without dribbling more than 2 steps. Kimbal Walker walked 5 steps before dribbling the ball. it was ridiculous. There are a bunch more. Traveling is more common than double dribble in NBA.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the biggest problem the NBA faces today?
The lack of time players spend in college.
You dont think its arrests?
I cant remember the last time players got arrested.
OK so back to the college thing, what can they do?
Its tough to come up with a resolution
Do you think they limit how young they can be?
I think its already at 19.
So be like the NFL and make them do 3 years in college.
I think this would be the best bet for the league.
Players wont want to go overseas for that long.
Then the college game is geting even better.
It would build rivalries in NCAA again.
I think they always still exist.
Right but we havent seen a Bird/Magic rivalry in 40 years.
And I dont know if we ever see that again.
Will the players come out better?
I think with that kind of seasoning, yes.
Who would argue against it?
Players union definitely would not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm excited about the Los Angeles Lakers' future.
Me too. I love the direction that the organization is going.
I mean bringing in Magic Johnson will definitely help this team
I concur. He is just what this organization needs going forward.
They have some tough decisions to make on this roster though
Yeah they do, I mean Metta World Peace is gone
They will probably get rid of Tarik Black and put D'Angelo Russell on the trading block
You think they will trade Russell? Why?
I think they are going to draft Lonzo Ball and he will be their point guard of the future
Yeah I can see that, but it seems too early to give up on Russell
Unless they decide that he can be their full-time shooting guard
I don't know if I see that out of him.
Yeah me too, but he has to either play the one or two
Right, but he doesn't seem entirely comfortable in either position.
So maybe they start the beginning of year with Ball at the point and Russell at the 2
See if they can play together well before they make any decisions.
Exactly. Both players are pretty good size, so you could play both at the same time.
They are both pretty weak defensively but they have time to get better
I think it's an experiment worth trying.
I do too. It's going to be an exciting year for the Lakers
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about that Wizards game last night?
Nice to finally get a competitive game in that series.
Yeah but I wish John Wall had hit a regular shot at the end instead of a three-pointer. We could have had overtime.
I'm just glad the Wizards won so we get a seventh game.
Who do you think will win that one?
I think Isaiah Thomas will have a huge performance at home. I see the Celtics taking it.
Don't you think the Wizards could have another huge run like they have been having in every game in this series?
I don't think the Celtics will let that happen at this point. They closed the Bulls out pretty convincingly.
Wizards are a better team than Chicago though.
Yes but Thomas is not as distracted in this series. He might be the best player in the series.
So you think Thomas is better than Wall?
Wall is a better passer. Thomas is a better scorer.
Either one of them can take over a game though. I don't think either is better than the other.
Both of them play better at home. Since this one is in Boston I think Isaiah will be the better player.
Do you think either of them has a chance against Cleveland.
Not a chance! Cleveland is resting while these two are killing each other.
Yeah, and Cleveland was better to begin with. The regular season record doesn't mean much.
Right. Lebron takes it to another level in the playoffs.
So then you think the Finals are set? A rematch between Cleveland and Golden State?
This past year has proven anything is possible so maybe not. But I'd be shocked if you see the Spurs, Wizards or Celtics in the Finals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched any of the NBA playoffs?
Yeah, they have been great games!
Did you see Leonard get injured?
Yeah, I feel bad for the Spurs.
Did you see the score at halftime for the Cavs and Celtics game?
Yeah! It was record breaking! Poor Celtics.
Did you see Isaiah Thomas' injury?
Yeah! Poor little thing. I hope he is 100% next season.
How many games do you think the Cavs vs. Celtics series will go?
Oh, they're playing all for games even after how the second game went?
Do you think Lebron is still the best player in the league?
Of course! When is his next game?
Do you think KD is incompetent?
Yeah, he could have never won a ring on his own.
When is the next playoff game?
That is tonight! Cavs play the Celtics at home.
Do you think Paul George will stay with the Pacers?
I hope so, but I can see him leaving.
Did you know Wilt Chamberlin played professional basketball under a false identity when he was 16?
I had no idea! What an interesting factoid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best player in the NBA right now.
I think I have to go with Russel Westbrook.
Really? He had a great season but he's a ball hog.
But he averaged a triple double this season. No one has done that since Oscar Robertson.
Yes I understand that. But Lebron is Lebron.
Lebron also has a team full of stars. It's only Russ on the Thunder.
But Russ doesn't have a championship mentality . That's why KD left.
KD just wanted a ring. If he would have stayed on the Thunder his time was coming.
Yeah but he didn't want to get older and have to team travel in order to get a ring. He looks good with the Warriors.
Realistic though Russ is by far the best in the league. Look at his stats.
Stats don't get you wins.
True but he's having an historical season. We might not see this in our lifetime again.
I don't know. I just think that the Thunder are just letting Russ get these stats.
Have you even seen the Thunder play this year?
No!! But I been watching highlights on ESPN.
My point exactly. I have the NBA league Pass. We can watch the game when they play the Heat and you will realize his skill.
Don't get me wrong I like Russ like I said but I'm not interested in one man basketball.
You know he's average a triple double in points, rebounds and assist right?
Yes I am aware of that.
Well how can you play one man ball if you are averaging more than 10 assist a game?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do the Cavaliers go 16-0 in the playoffs?
No they have no shot at that.
Do the Warriors go 16-0 in the playoffs?
I cant see that happening.
Do you think both of those teams end up 12-0 heading into the Finals?
Yes but then the real season starts.
Can you see it going all 7 games.
I sure hope so.
The NBA playoffs have been boring so far.
Yeah its a top heavy league and that is real apparent right now.
Hard to believe Boston was a number 1 seed.
Cleveland wasnt concerned about seeding.
So they could have been 8th and survived.
Absolutely they have the best team in the East.
Just because James is on the roster?
Couple him with Irving, and yes.
Notice you didnt bring Kevin Love into that.
Hes a part time player.
So hes better served on the bench?
Yeah he needs a strong supporting cast around him in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cavs/Raptors game last night?
Yeah the Raptors are done.
I know. They just aren't on the same level.
Lebron is too good.
Yep and they're too deep. Did you see that 3 Korver made?
I did. They've got him, JR Smith, Frye...
It's just not fair. They have the highest payroll in the league.
They do?
Yeah, by far. Lebron is good but they also basically just bought their team.
I know that's kind of lame.
Who do you think is going to win in the Celtics/Wizards series?
I don't know. I want the Celtics to win.
Yeah, me too. The Wizards look really good though.
Marcin Gortat is a beast.
John Wall is crazy good, too.
He's so good. He can steal, rebound score.
He's a great athlete.
A little out of control, though, he gets a lot of turnovers.
They sort of lack discipline.
Yeah I guess so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man I hope that the Houston Rockets play better in the playoffs next year
Yeah this was a bittersweet year for the Rockets
I agree. I mean a lot of people didn't think they would have a good year
Yeah most pundits predicted they would finish toward the bottom of the standings.
Yeah they really surprised a lot of people with their play this year
I mean most people didn't foresee them winning 55 games in the regular season.
True and a lot of people didn't like the D'antoni hire as head coach
Yep. But he proved them wrong. They have a great system.
Yep it is a fun brand of basketball to watch
But in the playoffs they played a bit mediocre
They really did. I mean they got passed the Thunder, but not in typical Rockets fashion.
True. They struggled a bit from the outside, but they did find a way to win that series.
The most disappointing part of the playoffs was the Spurs series.
I agree. I truly believe they should have beaten the Spurs
James Harden did not play well down the stretch
No he didn't I don't know if the guy just ran out of gas
I don't know either, but he shrunk in the big moments.
You can't have your best player fail to step up during those times.
Yeah, but maybe they can build off of this experience and be stronger next year.
I hope so. It was a successful year for that organization.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you rank as the best player in the NBA today?
Steph Curry hands down.
So LeBron isnt on that list anymore?
No his time has passed.
So if you take him off the Cavaliers the results wont wane too much?
No it would dip.
And if you take Curry off the Warriors, they would maintain their position?
They probably could survive that.
OK so you are making my point.
Actually you are making mine.
LeBron is so valuable to his team.
That does not make him the best player
Theres no way they survive without him though.
Yeah but hes that way because of his surroundings.
So do the other players make Steph good?
No hes the best pure shooter ever.
Thats hard to believe.
He doesnt need to drive the ball to be effective.
Well he cant with that frame.
I still do not subscribe to your viewpoint.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Carmelo Anthony is going to be playing in New York next year?
I think so.
You don't think the Knicks are going to try to use him as trade fodder?
I think they might, but I don't think they'll get as much in return as they could have gotten two or three years ago.
He's still an All-Star!
Yes, but he's at the tail end of his prime and I think the Knicks are not going to accept that reality.
Well, you forget that Melo doesn't exactly seem happy in New York. He might ask for a trade.
Well, that would be different. If Melo pushes the issue, I could see the Knicks cutting a deal.
You just don't think the Knicks will get a player of his caliber?
Not exactly. I think the Knicks are going to over-estimate Carmelo's abilities and demand someone better than he is.
Surely they know he's not on the same level as a James Harden or Russell Westbrook!
No doubt, but it doesn't mean they won't act like they don't know. They might take a developing player, but they're not going to accept a medire one.
Do you think Melo definitely wants out?
I don't know, but I suspect he'd bolt for a chance to win. His window for a championship is closing.
Where would he go, if he went, do you think?
Maybe Boston. I can't see him landing anywhere like Cleveland or Golden State because they have no room.
The Cavs always seem willing to trade Kevin Love and Melo is friends with LeBron.
Love is a way better fit for the Cavs than Melo and I'm sure LeBron knows that.
Why Boston, then?
They're young and could use solid veteran leadership. Actually, so could a team like the Sixers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Game 6 between the Boston Celtics and the Washington Wizards the other night?
That was a really tough loss for Boston. I was hoping they would keep their lead and pull it off in the end.
Me too, I can't believe they lost by 1 point.
It seemed like the Celtics were really struggling to make their shots in the first quarter.
I know, what was strange was that they made 4 out of 17 shot attempts but we're still only down by 5 points at the end of the first quarter.
Avery Bradley's alley-oop dunk right before halftime was awesome!
That was great to watch. I was so excited when the Celtics had the lead at halftime.
One of the reasons things didn't work out for them is because John Wall had a tremendous game.
True, his shooting was terrible in the first half but he still came back as aggressive as ever in the second half.
It was Wall's 7-0 shooting run that brought the Wizard's back and tied the game.
Wall wasn't able to make his  three point shots but he had his jump shot down and it showed.
He dominated under the basket as well.
As usual, Isaiah Thomas was integral in keeping the Celtics in the game.
His step back jumper to take the lead in the last quarter was poetry in motion.
I just don't know what happened. The Celtics were up by 2 with only a little over seven seconds left in the game and possession of the ball.
It seemed like they were either frazzled or sloppy and that's how they ended up turning the ball over to Wall.
My heart sunk when Wall put up that 3 pointer from way out there to take the lead.
Me too, I was hoping it didn't go in but he drained that shot right over Avery Bradley like it was easy.
That's when they took the lead. It was over from there.
True, but the desperate shot Isaiah Thomas put up at the buzzer didn't look horribly off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the playoff game, Spurs and Rockets?
No, I haven't been following the series. What's going on with it?
Today, the Spurs won in overtime. The game was a bit ugly, but it was close and exciting.
Was Harden getting a ton of free throws?
No, just a lot of turnovers and missed shots at the end.
Yeah, I guess that can happen with a team that shoots a ton of 3s.
So the Spurs are up 3-2 now, but game 6 is in Houston.
You think the Spurs will close it out or it will go to 7?
I think Houston probably wins at home, and then game 7 will be a toss-up.
Yeah, they seem pretty evenly matched from what I've seen.
I thought the Spurs were in trouble when Tony Parker hurt his leg, but Patty Mills has filled in pretty well.
Oh, I didn't realize he got hurt.
Yeah, out for the season. Nene on the Rockets got hurt too.
Both older guys, that makes sense.
I think either team is going to have to play out of their minds to beat the Warriors though.
Yeah, they're definitely another level above these teams.
Plus they are resting right now, while these teams play 2-3 extra games.
And you said this one went to overtime, so that's even more wear and tear.
True, good point. That's the beauty of being a top seed, you're more likely to win quick and get more rest.
Yeah, good call.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Harden's beard and hair do?
I know, he looks like a point guard turned mountain man.
I think the Spurs are good enough to make it to the finals at least.
Keep wishing.  They are flimsy and prone to injuries.
The Lakers have a deep bench and will win it all.
I don't think so.  They don't work well as a team.  Too many showboats and not enough team work.
Do you see westbrooks little breakdown on the court after he was called for a foul?
I did.  It was quite a hissy fit considering he did commit the foul.
I think the may be Durant's last year.  He doesn't shine like he used to.
Nah.  He scored like 22 point last game.  There is plenty of life left in him.
Are the Thunder and Bulls ever going to play again?
I don't know but if they do I have it's in Chicago.  I may be able to get tickets.
I can't believe Curry fouled out.  He never does that!
I know, it's like the ref's had him under a microscope.
I think the Knicks should just hang it up.  They can't win for losing.
It ain't over, they just need to jell as a team.  They'll get there.
I'm going to record the Cavaliers tonight.  Don't tell me about it until I watch it!
Spoiler alert eh?  Should be a good game.  You better watch it ASAP.
Where is Dwight Howard from?  I'd never heard of him until the NBA.
He played for the  Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy.  He was an unknown until the NBA snapped him up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cavs game?
Yeah, I did.
What did you think?
I was pleased with the win.
I hope they go to the playoffs this year.
That would be really great.
Do you think LeBron is better than Michael Jordan?
Maybe technically as a player, but I think Jordan was a lot more likeable.
He was a bit more down to earth than King James.
I definitely think LeBron's choices keep him from being the icon Jordan was.
Jordan was my favorite player as a kid.
Mine too.
That stint in baseball was ill-advised, though.
I can understand wanting to try something new. He had done everything there was to do in baskeball by the time he was 30.
That's true.
I think when he returned to basketball it was more for the money than that he wanted to continue playing.
I agree. He was never quite the same when he came back.
Nothing is usually as good the second time around.
I can agree with that. Are you watching the next Bulls game?
No, I stopped following them a while ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, when is the Final Four?
It's next week, and I can't wait!
I think the Kentucky Wildcats are going make it all the way.
Well, I feel the Cincinnati Bearcats haveva chance as well.
I was shocked at how well Cincinnati has played the past few games.
That's why they've been my team for years.
They may be good, but Kentucky is a national power house.
I don't think Kentucky will get past Kansas.
Really? Kansas is on a down slide with injuries.
I forgot about that, but they still haveva great coach.
Speaking of coaches. John Calipari may be the best ever.
I feel he breaks the rules alot.
He has put two schools on probation.
But, don't get me wrong I'd play for him.
He's put so many players in the NBA it's ridiculous.
But, those kids never get an education.
Those kids will be rich beyond their wildest dreams.
But, also dumber than a box of rocks..
You got a point, but I'd rather be rich and dumb, than smart and broke.
Ok, the game's about to start, go CATS!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the basketball game last night?
Yeah it was great, I am surprised they won!
Did you bet any money on the game?
Yeah, I did. I bet around one thousand and won five thousand.
Are you going to keep betting on basketball games?
Yeah and I hope I win too.
Any other good games on tonight?
I don't think so.
I'm going to the game on Saturday night. Do you wanna come?
Yeah what time is it?
It is at 8'Clock, I can drive.
Awesome, come over at 6.
Yeah I will. It is going to be a great game.
Yeah, I hope. They need this game for the playoffs.
I think our team will win.
Me too. This is going to be a great game.
Do you want to go to a restaurant before the basketball game?
Yeah lets do it.
I think it will be cheaper than eating at the arena.
Totally.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, How about the playoffs this year?
I know right.  But it feels repetitive anymore.
I agree.  It is always Golden State and Cleveland
Yeah, though this year they haven't made it yet.
Yeah, but they will.  No one can stand up to either team.
Basketball has about become unwatchable because players just join teams to play with the best, not against them.
Everyone wants their championship. Ya know?
I understand.  It just makes it boring to watch sometimes.
So who do you have winning it all?
I think Cleveland was a fluke in the Championship last year.  So I have Golden State
Yeah me too.  Plus I just can't stand LeBron.
I actually like him.  I wouldn't say he is the goat, but he is dang good.
I don't doubt his talents.  It is his flopping and constant complaining.
Yeah, he is very bad about that.  He would make a great Soccer player!
No doubt!  All that flopping around.
How many games do you think the finals will go?
I am going 6 games. Golden State 4-2
I agree on Golden State winning it.  But I have it 4-3 in 7 games.
It very well could end like that again.
It would at least make it somewhat interesting!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, which teams should blow it up?
Clearly, the Pacers. I just don't think they have the ability to convince PG to stay
Agreed, their best chance is to convince the Lakers to give up a good piece to acquire George
Would the Lakers actually do it?
What we know from Magic when he joined the Dodgers, the man loves a splash
George would be a splash. But isn't it better to wait?
Definitely. To me, the Lakers should continue to bet young
Draft Ball?
Yes. Look into trading Russell for a shot blocker. Figure out George in 2018
That is the wisest decision, but not so "LA"
Back to exploding teams - what about Toronto?
Tough question. This team can't make the finals if Lebron is around. Is that good enough?
Even further, can it last much longer. Lowry is older.
I still don't like DeRozan's game in the post season. And Lowry hasn't been great in the playoffs
It's tough because they can't trade anyone besides DeRozan and who would take him?
I mean, the Lakers?
Hah. I hope not
Another blow up candidate - Chicago
Yep. But they won't because they are the Bulls
Trading Jimmy would give them a fresh start. Which they won't take
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be in the NBA Finals?
Definitely Golden State.
What about from the East?
Cleveland. The only question is who will win that series?
I think it will be close.
I heard Golden State will be heavy favorites.
The West is much tougher than the East.
Agreed, but the Cavs are pretty good.
Sure, but they only have 1 decent player.
True. Without him, they would not even make the playoffs.
Do you think the Kevin Durant trade was good?
Well, it has certainly worked out so far.
I think the Warriors would win the championship even without him.
That may be true, but you can never have too many all-stars.
What time is the next game?
I think the Celtics and Cavs play tonight.
Where is the game?
Cleveland. The Cavs won both games in Boston.
Wow. Their season may as well be over.
Agreed. It would take a miracle for Boston to win the series now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This playoffs this year have been really disappointing.
I agree. I dont know what happened to competition.
Lebron James and the Warriors happened.
Yea, can we just fast forward to that series already.
That would be better. Those teams are gonna be squaring off.
Yea, I just wish there was more competition.
Don't we all. They need to do away with these super teams.
Yea, its getting old already.
Yea, I don't know how they can avoid it.
Me either. These players keep joining together.
It seems like it. They want to win.
Yea, true, but whatever happened to doing it without teaming with others.
Well, it takes a team to win.
True, I agree.
Yea, I know what you mean though. Its not natural.
Yea, Lebron had to leave and then come back to establish himself.
Yea, he did that in a big way.
He sure did.
Yea, where are the criques now.
They are still out  there under tables and chairs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can I play basketball after school?
Yes. Do you like playing?
I love it.
Are you good at it?
I'm good at making baskets but I need to be more aggressive.
Why's that?
If you're not people take the ball from you.
I see. How do you get better at that?
I guess just practice. I will do that today.
Do you want me to practice with you later?
Sure. We can do that after dinner.
I'd like that too.
I have to work on dribbling too.
Is that where you bounce the bal over and over?
Sort of but there's more to it.
Is that hard to do?
Yes, kind of.
I hope you can get better at that too. We'll work on that as well.
Thanks for offering to help me.
No problem at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Golden State Warriors game tonight?
Yes, they won and swept the Jazz.
They will probably win another championship.
The only team that has a chance to beat them is Cleveland.
Cleveland may win a game or two, but that's about it.
You're probably right.
Kind of isn't fair that they had a great team and added Kevin Durant.
Yeah, the NBA is kind of always that way; one or two teams are stacked and everyone else is mediocre.
Yeah, I wonder how they managed to stay under the cap.
The cap in the NBA is a soft cap, and essentially a joke.
The NHL and the NFL have it right with a hard cap.
Yeah, it creates more balance. Did you know that only about 8 teams have won the championship since 1985.
That's it? The same old teams always seem to win a championship.
Yeah, I believe it was only the Lakers, Celtics, Pistons, Spurs, Bulls, Rockets, Cavaliers, Mavericks, Heat, and the Warriors.
That's 10 teams.
Still, that's not too much of competitive balance.
Kind of sucks that it will be one of those teams again: Cavaliers or Warriors.
You mean the Warriors.
Yes, the Warriors. Nobody will beat them.
What a boring league.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Derrick Rose is done?
Well I mean he will keep playing basketball but I think MVP Rose is gone.
It is such a shame he was so athletic and fun to watch.
Yes, but all those knee surgeries and downtimes are really catching up with him.
Yeah that same slashing speed seems to be gone.
That's what I think too. Plus he is in Knicks purgatory now too.
Yeah, no one comes back from that dark place.
Yeah and they have two super ball dominant players running the triangle.  It makes no sense.
Well it makes sense if it was 1990.
Yeah and you had Michael Jordan to make it all look good.
As good as Jordan was I think it was the fact that zone defense was illegal that made the zone viable.
Probably. I wonder why they changed that rule.
Probably because it made the game less fun to watch.
True, that is the same reason they are going to get rid of the hack-a-Shaq.
I think you are right but I wish they wouldn't.
Why? It is so bad to watch.
I agree with that but it seems like ensuring you can hit free throws should not be too much to ask of NBA players.
That makes sense but I just don't care.  I don't want to watch free throws anyways.
Yeah I think a lot of people feel like that.
They do and that is why they are going to fix hack-a-Shaq with some rule change.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the March Madness games this year?
Na, I don't really watch college ball.
You should of really checked it out! The games were intense.
Oh, how so?
So many games came down to the last few minutes.
They were that close?
Yup, all the way to the end.
Okay, that sounds great.
I know, right?
What games would you recommend watching?
Honestly, every game.
All of it?!
They were all really close to the start.
But are there any specific amazing games?
Just watch all of it, trust me.
But that's a lot of games!
But it's so worth it!
I dunno, I don't think I have the time.
Neither do I, since we're both skeletons.
Oh, right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the Celtics/Cavaliers series.
I am, the Celtics are getting killed!
I know, when is the next game?
I think it's tonight.
Is it in Cleveland or Boston?
I think this one is in Cleveland.
I hope the Celtics can win at least one.  It's a boring series if they don't.
I agree I hate when one team dominates the whole series.
LeBron is tough to beat and has been all over the Celtics.
He has been a nightmare for them.  They can't stop him.
Too bad for Boston that they lost the games where they had home court advantage.
That was their best shot and unfortunately they blew it.
I hate to say it but I think Cleveland will sweep.
I don't know, I think Boston still has some life in them.
I hope you are right, I want to at least see Cleveland challenged.
Me too, I don't want this series to be too easy for them.
If the Celtics can figure out their offense they will have a shot.
They also have to make sure the defense is flawless
Well I guess we will see tonight.
Yup, should be a great game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cant wait until next season start, my Pelicans are going to be great!
I dont know, they have really struggled for a very long time.
Those days are over, the future is very bright in New Orleans.
You may be right, what makes you think they are going to turn the corner?
They got Demarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis!
That is true, but there is only so much they can on their own.
That is true, but having the two best big men in the league is a great start!
Are they going to get a new coach?
No, they are going to keep Alvin Gentry.
Wow, do you still have confidence in him?
I do, but he really needs to show us fans something this year!
What are your expectations for next year to be a success.
I feel that we should not only be in the payoffs next year, but at least a top 5 seed.
That would be a major step in the right direction for sure.
I feel Cousins and Davis are going to be unstoppable as a unit!
Do you think they will make any more moves in free agency?
I hope so we really need some quality shooters!
Yea, with Davis and Cousins guys should be open all the time.
I would love to get a guy like Kyle Korver, he is a great shooter.
Yea, I dont think the cavs will be letting him go anytime soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are the celtics still in the playoffs?
I don't know. I know they were, I dont know if they are still in.
Did they play at the Garden?
Yeah. There was a playoff game the same night as one of the baseball games.
Who does Paul piere play for now?
I dont know, some team that isn't as good as the Celtics.
I heard he was retired this year.
I think the Celtics are just retiring his jersey number.
Are you going to try to go to that game?
Yeah, but I probably won't be able to get tickets,
Do you go to a lot of celtics games?
Not really .I prefer college basketball more.
What team do you watch?
The Friars.
What school are they from?
Providence College
Did you grow up watching them?
Yeah. My dad watched them and we went to games sometimes.
Do you watch any March Madness?
Not usually
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Lebron is better and Jordan was.
I think you are wrong.
Well just watching him he sees more dominant.
I could see that but when Jordan took over there was nothing like it.
Is that all you have to go off of?
No.
Well what else?
How bout the rings, the points, the historical moments, the fact he never ran to other teams.
Those are better arguments.
I hate hypothetical though.
Yeah as a whole I am sure the athletes now are better than the athletes were back then.
Right, but they have so much more at their disposal.
Yeah, the teams put them in the best possible position to be successful.
Yeah the training and health is way better now.
Yeah and the athletes are under such scrutiny it matters if they take it seriously.
Yeah, so maybe Lebron is better.
Thank you.
But only because of the advances in medicine.
I'm not so sure of that.
Well you are never going to convince me that Jordan is not the greatest ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey did you watch the nba finals?
yes, that was on crazy game!
I know I am so glad lebron was able to get another championship ring
Im not really a cavaliers fan, my favorite team is the knicks!
the knicks suck! I don't know why you are still a die hard fan
I know but I have to stay loyal, I know Carmello will bring us a win next year!
Maybe, if he stopped hogging the ball and be a team player then you guys could win
I think they just need to pick better players during the drafts, instead of these international players no one has heard of
I suppose, but lebron will always be my favorite player no matter what team he is on
He is a real good player, helping Ohio get their first championship!
Although, I still wish that he was on the Heats
Yea the Heats did have a triple threat with Wade, Lebron, and Bosh
Yea, those were the best games that I have been to
Were you at the game when they went into double overtime
no, but that was during the final championship everyone thought the game was over, but it kept going into overtime
that was one crazy game!
I wonder if lebron is going to make Cavilers is permanent home
He should, they will definitely burn his jersey if he leaves them again
knicks need to burn carmello jersey just because!
that is not nice at all
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you see the Raptors doing next year?
I don't know. I feel this organization is at a crossroads
Yeah they have to figure out if the Lowry Demarr Derozan tandem is going to work going forward
I just feel like they can't get any further with this tandem
It may be time to move on from it
Yeah, but I think the organization is going to try and build from this
They picked up Serge Ibaka at the trading deadline and he played pretty well for them
That he did but he isn't enough to get over the hump in the East
Exactly. This team needs 3 point shooting badly
They definitely do. They also seemed to be weak mentally
Yeah Lowry seems to fall apart in the big moments. I don't trust this team
Neither do I. They just seem to shrink against the big teams.
Especially Cleveland. They always wet the bed against them.
The pacers gave the Cavs more of a challenge then the Raptors did.
I know that is embarrassing. That's why I would seriously consider changing the course of this team.
I agree, but I do't think the organization has the stones to do it.
They will just keep treading water. Happy with a 2nd round exit.
That's why some organizations never really prosper
Yeah they like to play it safe and that is not going to get it done
Yep they will stay in the middle of the pack
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is there a basketball club here at school?
Yes, there is a club that meets once a week.
Do you know how many people have joined this club?
I'm not sure but it is very popular.
Does this club compete in games versus other schools?
Yes, they just played Mountainview last night.  The game was very exciting.
Was the score very close?
Yes, the game was decided in the last minute.
Who ended up winning the game?
Our school won!  I'm sure more people will want to join the club after that game.
I certainly want to join. Is there a club for boys and girls?
No, the boys and girls play on the same team.  It seems like a lot of fun.
When does the club meet for practice?
I think they meet at lunchtime.
Do you know what day they meet?
I believe it is on Wednesdays.
Fantastic!  I'll see if they meet tomorrow since tomorrow is Wednesday.
Perfect!  I'll look forward to watching you in an upcoming game.
Thanks!
Have fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a basketball fan?
Yes, I've been watching since I was a kid.
What's your favorite team?
I grew up in New York, so I love the Knicks.
My favorite has always been the Celtics.
Are you a big fan as well?
Yes, I grew up watching the Celtics and Lakers rivalry in the 1980's.
Too bad the Celtics are being dismantled by the Cavaliers.
I know. It's tough to watch.
Have you been keeping up on the NBA playoffs this year?
Yes, These games haven't even been close.
The Cavaliers and Warriors have been dismantling teams left and right.
I don't think either of them have even dropped a game yet this postseason.
I know. Crazy isn't it?
Do you think it's good for the game that they're so dominant?
I'm not sure, although I love a great rivalry.
Do you think they will play each other for the third year in a row?
I don't see how they can be stopped.
Who do you think would win?
I think the Cavaliers will win again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will an expansion team ever come to the NBA?
I think Vegas could be next
Do they really need expansion though?
Not really, the qaulity of rosters isnt that great right now.
Yeah I think they need to tell future players they have to wait 3 years out of high school.
The problem is theyll just go overseas.
Then they should say 3 years in college.
How do you tell a player they have to go to school though when they have free will?
I dont know they have to figure that out.
Well back to Vegas, do you think a 2nd team will come in?
With the way games are scheduled I dont think you need to have 2 teams.
Yeah they could probably do with just 1.
How do you staff a team like that?
Let them pick 1, 2, and 3 in the NBA draft and then make 5 selections from the best 5 teams in the league.
Why punish a team for having a good roster?
Well you want the franchise to be good, to increase attendance.
I dont see that being an issue in Vegas.
Its more of a tourist place though.
Yeah but to catch a sporting event out there? People would do it.
They may but you need a winner on the court right away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about college basketball vs. the NBA?
I strongly prefer watching college basketball.
Why? The NCAA takes advantage of its students by not paying them.
Well, they're not employees, and if they get scholarships, they have free tuition, so they are paid.
I still think they should be paid.
I just hate that they can't get ANYTHING from anyone. If you receive $5 for an autograph once in four years, you're kicked out, and a lot of these players are super poor.
Why else do you like them?
I think NCAA plays with more passion. They're there to make it to the next level and they know they have four years max to win a championship, so they have to go all-out.
Yeah, that's true, the NBA players are lazy as heck.
And the referees don't call traveling!
What do you think about men vs. women basketball?
The men would win because they're taller, faster, stronger...
That's not what I meant, you misogynist. Which do you prefer, and why?
I prefer men's. The women are too predictable--you always know who'll be in the final four and UConn will win the title.
Yeah, at least the men have ten teams each year that can win it all.
I also think it's more entertaining.
Ok, misogynist, how so?
Stop calling me that. I just like dunks, and with a handful of exceptions, women can't dunk. And if they can, it's barely above the rim.
Yeah, the men put on a show.
And that's what I'm paying to see. I'm not paying to see some excellent bounce passes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know all this talk about pro basketball makes me wonder.
Wonder what?
What's the NBA revenue every year?
There 30 teams, and combined, they've generated 5.87 billion in the last season.
And the one before that?
About %.18 and this has been increasing every year.
And the feeder teams to these NBA teams are our college teams?
Yes, more or less, they also have minor league for NBA just like NFL and MLB.
Those are so sad.
Why is that?
I mean these are athletes who really just love the game, but are deemed not talented enough to play in the big leagues.
Yes, so? How is that bad?
I would be sad and disappointed if I wasn't chosen to play in the big league, and I'll probably give up and get a real job.
So, the fact that they're hanging on to their dream of making it in the big leagues is what makes it sad?
i guess so.
Well, for whatever it's worth NBA development league, that's their "minor league" does have a number of players who went on to play in the NBA
Like who?
There are 32 players who once played in the D league who went on to win an NBA title.
Most recently?
Cavaliers, Dahntay jones, Sasha Kaun, And Jordan Mcrae all played in the D league before getting picked by the Cav's
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, did you see the crazy game of Celtics and Wizards last night?
Yeah! It was so close.
Who do you think will win the NBA finals?
I think for sure the Golden State Warriors will win it this year.
Do you think these shoes will make me better at basketball?
Yeah, those Kobe shoes look fresh and keep you stable on the court?
How many points does a shot from here give you?
That gives you 2 points.
Who is your favorite basketball player of all time?
Michael Jordan of course!
What game is tomorrow?
The game between Warriors and the Spurs.
Who is your favorite team in the NBA?
The Spurs of course!
John Wall is such an explosive player. I can see him becoming better and better over time.
Yeah for sure. He is so fun to watch!
Kobe Bryant sure is having the time of his life.
Yeah, after retirement he has become a legend. He will always be remembered!
I think Pau Gasol is such a weak tall man.
Yeah, he is so soft and flops all the time at crucial moments.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Celtics-Cavs the other night?
No, I don't watch the NBA; I prefer collegiate.
Did you at least hear about it?
Yeah, I saw a lot of people from Cleveland posting about it on Facebook.
Holy crap, right?
Yeah, seriously, losing by nearly 50 in the playoffs. Horrid.
I've never heard of such an epic loss
I kind of want them to be punished for it, it was that bad.
How so?
Like, they should forfeit the entire series.
Come on, you know they'll come back to win at least one more.
No, I don't. You lose by 50, you're done, and should be out of the playoffs for years.
I don't follow.
Well, in European soccer leagues, if you don't perform at a certain level over time, you're demoted.
So, what would you suggest?
They shouldn't be allowed to play in the playoffs next year unless they win the series.
That's cruel.
It's also realistic. They're being paid tens of millions to get humiliated.
You're a bit harsh.
No...and they lost at home. By nearly 50. In the conference finals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite team?
Memphis Grizzlies, what about you?
The suns
Have you been to any games?
A few
I have been to a few Grizzlies games at home.
Did you ever play basketball
In high school, you?
No, I wanted to but never did.
That's too bad it was fun
It looked fun, I think I was too nervous to try out.
Who is your favorite player
Eric Bledsoe, you?
Marc Gasol
Have you always liked the Grizzlies?
Yes, what about you?
They have always been my team
Did they do good last season?
Yes,  what about the Grizzlies
They had a great season
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the basketball game last night?
Yeah, Golden State won 120-108.
The game was close in the first quarter.
After that quarter, the Warriors controlled the game.
Kevin Durant was dominant!
I heard he scored 33 points and had 10 rebounds.
Curry had a great game too.
He had 21 points.
The series is at 3-0 now
I'm thinking Golden State will sweep and move on to the next round.
When's the next game?
They play Monday.
If they sweep on Monday, it'll be the third straight sweep by the Warriors.
Yeah, they've had a great playoff run.
San Antonio has a lot of injuries.
If they were healthy, I think this would've been a closer series.
Even if they were healthy, it would be tough for San Antonio to win.
Yeah, Golden State has a great team
I'm thinking Golden State might win it all this year.
I agree with you on that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the game between UCLA and Kentucky?
Yes, it was pretty interesting.
Who was UCLA's leading scorer.
Leaf and Hamilton both scored 17 points for UCLA.
Who was the leading scorer for Kentucky?
Fox had a whopping 39 points.
Wow, how did he do that?
They could not keep him from getting to the basket.
Okay, who led UCLA in rebounding?
Leaf and Welsh both had 7 rebounds a piece.
Who led Kentucky in rebounding?
Willis had 8 rebounds.
Wow, I wouldn't expect that from Willis.
Yea, it was his night on the glass.
Who led UCLA in assists?
Lonzo Ball led the team with 8 assists.
Well, that's not surprising with Ball's play-making skills.
Exactly, Ball is #1 in the nation for assists.
So, tell me what the final score was.
Kentucky won with 86 points while UCLA scored 75 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the tallest player in the NBA anyway?
Currently playing?
Yes, as of now.
Did you know there have only been 25 players who were listed as being 59 or shorter?
That doesn't answer my question.
No, not yet.
So as of now, who's the shortest player who's on an active roster of an NBA team?
isaiah Thomas with the Celtics is the shortest currently. But he's no way as short as the shortest ever
Who was the shortest player to ever play in the NBA?
That would be Muggsy Bogues
Who did he play for? Was he any good?
This dude was 5'3. He literally looked like a midget or a hobbit next to other players. It was ridiculous. And yes, he was actually pretty good.
Imean even for a normal average person, 5'3 is pretty short.
Even for a girl, it's pretty short.
And imagine this guy's playing in the NBA...
he played for 14 years for 4 different teams
He's gotta have some game, man,
Dude was fast. He looked like a little midget running past all these slow moving giants. Dude was a legend
I wonder if he ever tried to dunk and succeeded...
That reminds me sprite had a commercial about it. But in real life, no. The shortest player to ever dunk on the standard size basket was 5'5 I believe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game last night with the Bulls?
No I didn't.  Who were they playing?
They were playing the Celtics.
Oh, I love the Boston team.  Sorry I missed it.
It was a pretty good game, fairly evenly matched all night.
So, who pulled it out in the end?
The Bulls got a three pointer right at the buzzer.
Great, those kind of finishes are always exciting.
I know, I was screaming waiting for the ball to drop it.
Bet you woke up the house when you did that.
No, my family is used to me getting excited when I am watching basketball.
Are there any games on tonight?
Yes, the Bulls are playing the New York team tonight.
That should be a good game.  Isn't the New York team in first place at the moment?
No, they lost last night by a lot to the Lakers.
Used to love the Lakers years back.  They have had some great players.
I know.  The Bulls are the same way - a great history of players.
Still miss MIchael Jordan, huh?
You bet, and Scottie Pippen too.
Somebody new will rise to the top for the Bulls.  You'll see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lebron James?
Yes, but I haven't always liked him.
What do you mean by that?
Well when he first came into the league, I thought he was a showboat.
I can see your point of view there.
Yeah, he just seemed to have everything given to him.
But he is so skilled, and people love to watch that.
I agree with you there, but I value humbleness, and I think he used to lack that.
So were you a fan when he left Cleveland to go to Miami?
I actually thought that was pretty funny, and I laughed at the people of Cleveland.
Wow, that's pretty mean-spirited.
Well I just thought it was pathetic for people to care that much about a basketball player.
I get it. It seems like some people took it too personally.
Yes, and it was great when he went down to Miami and won a championship.
But then he came back to Cleveland and won one for them as well.
Yes, but it took awhile. I'm sure a lot of people thought that it never would happen.
So what do you think of their team this year?
Well the Cavs always have a chance with Lebron there, so they might get it done again.
Personally, I like their chances too. They have a good all-around team to support him.
The Western Conference looks exciting this year too, so the Finals should be entertaining to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the blood bath that was the Cleveland / Boston Game the other night?
Yes I did, what was the halftime score?
I can't believe Cleveland was up by 30 points at halftime.
I still don't believe they won't by almost 50.
What do you think is wrong with Isiah Thomas?
I think his sisters death is still effecting him.
The NBA released their first -second and third teams, did you see them?
Yeah, I agree with most but Curry should be first team.
Do you think David Stern was a good commissioner?
I really do, but he was also aided by the superstar players in the league: Shaq, Kobe, Young Lebron.
Who do you think will end up in the finals?
Thats easy, Golden State and Cleveland.
Who do you think will win between Golden State and the Cavs.
It will be a great series, probably the best this playoff but the Cavs will definitely win.
What do you think the series will end up being if they both make it?
Cleveland in 6.
Do you think Boston regrets trying to go small against the Cavs?
Of course they do, they tried it and lost by like 50.
Have you ever seen an uglier, one sided playoff game.?
No and I still can't believe it was in the conference finals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that game between Duke and UCLA?
Yeah, that was a fantastic game.
Grayson was on fire last night.
I know, he's such a powerful player.
I wish I could slam dunk like him.
He makes it look so easy!
He was hitting 3 pointers all night.
He is super talented.
That team really looks like they are outpracticing all their opponents.
For sure!
I'd love to see a home game.
We should do it.
Seeing Duke play live is so exciting.
They have a great team this season.
Coach Davis is such a strong leader.
I wish the WIldcats had him when I was in school.
There's a game on tonight.
Wanna come to my place and watch it?
That'd be great! I'd love to see it.
Great - I'll make nachos!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The San Antonio Spurs are getting killed in this series.
Yeah it is 3-0. They might get swept.
I think they will get swept for sure.
I mean they just don't have enough firepower.
Also with Kawhi Leonard out this series has been a joke
Yeah this has been too easy for the Warriors
I mean after game one this series has not been competitive
Well without Kawhi there almost no point in continuing this games.
Yeah I know. But at least this series will be over after game 4
Yeah the Warriors have been cruising.
I mean almost their entire starting lineup will be in the hall of fame one day
When you look at that roster, it is so unfair
I mean this team was good before they added Durant
Absolutely. Now they are a freaking all star team
I couldn't agree with you more
This Warriors team is going to win the championship
Yeah there is no doubt in my mind
They are undefeated in this post season
And most of the games haven't been close
Yeah they are making a mockery of the league
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been keeping up with cavs they did amazing against the celtics.
Nah i have not had a chance to watch that game.
Do you got it prerecorded or something?
Most definitely i did.
Good it is a game you do not want to miss it is honestly the best one i have seen for them this season.
Is it? How good was it?
They wrecked the celtics like they were nothing i have never seen anything like that.
You have not before?
Yes it was like a storm and they were the storm itself.
Now you are making me want to watch the game more now.
It is all thanks to Lebron he is the mighty hand of the Cavs.
I mean lebron is good without a doubt but..
But what? he is the reason the team is succeeding.
The whole team is responsible for it because they are a collective whole..
I mean they help but they need their star player and he is the star player.
That is true he is the star of the show and is the most well known.
Exactly he is the face of  the team and the best on it hands down.
I mean he is the best but by a very small margin.
Name me one player who is almost as good.
I would say Chris is pretty amazing on the team to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's better, LeBron or Jordan?
Are you kidding me?
What? That's a serious question.
Of course the answer is Jordan. It's not even close.
Not even close? That's not fair at all.
What's so great about LeBron?
I think he's a better overall player.
He's a better passer and he's a bigger guy.
Right. He's more versatile than Jordan. Jordan was mainly a scorer.
But that doesn't make him better. Jordan was a much better leader.
I think a lot of the leadership on Jordan's teams came from Phil Jackson.
Phil played a big part for sure. But Jordan was a major force as well.
People often compare LeBron to Magic, but I don't think that's a good fit.
I kind of agree with that. He's not quite Magic, and he's not quite Jordan.
Yeah, he's something in between.
One thing that always bothered me about LeBron was that he never entered the Dunk Contest.
You know, I've always wondered about that.
Why did he never compete?
He said one time that he didn't want to take the spotlight away from other players in the contest.
I think that sounds like a lame excuse.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you feel is the most overrated NCAA conference in basketball?
Mens or womens?
Mens of course. The womens are all the same.
Again, you're sexist. I'd have to say the American conference.
What? Why?
Well, their two premiere teams are usually Cincinnati and UConn, neither of whom have done anything in a while
UConn just won the title a few years ago!
True, but that was as a 7-seed. They haven't been dominant.
Elaborate.
Well, the past few years has seen Memphis, Houston, ECU, UConn, and Cincinnati all being highly-ranked, and temple being respected as well.
So?
Well, with the exception of UConn, no one has done well on the national stage. They play well, then bomb in the tournament.
Yeah, that's true, Their non-conference schedules are weak as well.
So, your choice?
Big Ten for sure.
Why?
Well, everyone keeps saying they're one of the strongest because of MSU, Wisconsin, and OSU's recent strong seasons, but no titles.
Well, Wisconsin was robbed against Duke, that's pretty much been proven.
Yeah. Indiana and Maryland are also supposed to be strong schools but always fade in the tournament.
It's like the Big Ten and American are great regular-season conferences, but awful in the tournament.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be picked for MVP this year?
Lebron James.
Yeah, he sounds like the obvious pick.
Who do you want to see get it?
Anyone but Isaiah Thomas.
Isaiah's the new bad boy in the league, isn't he?
Nah, he just needs to control his temper a bit.
He's no Dennis Rodman, that's for sure.
Rodman was a real character, wasn't he? Did he ever win MVP?
I doubt it.
I'd like to see Kawhi Leonard of the Spurs become MVP.
What are his chances?
I think he has a decent chance. He's team's highest scorer.
Advancing in the playoffs would probably help him get the award.
Lebron James will probably get it, though.
When will the award be announced?
After the end of season.
After? Since when?
Since this year. It's the first time the NBA has waited until the season is over to announce the MVP.
I guess they want to build up the anticipation, or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest player to ever play basketball?
You can't pick just one.
That's why I asked who do YOU think is the greatest.
I can tell you my favorites first
Go on.
Well, I guess we could to the ranking by the scoring leaders first.
Ok. Fine, whatever.
Let's see the player with the most points over career is Karem Abdul Jabbar, but that's a bad metric.
Howzat?
Because not many people can stay healthy and play as many games as Jabbar did.
How many games and how many points?
Jabbar played 1560 games and scored 38387 points.
So that's about 24 points per game
More or less.
So what happens if we use the points per game metric, who's the greatest?
That will bring us to my favorite player. Michael Jordan, with 30.12 points per game.
how does he rank in terms of total life points?
You mean points over his career, he ranks 4th behind, Jabbar, Malone, and believe it or not Bryant.
How many games did Jordan play?
he played 1072 games and scored 32292 points. Almost 500 games less than Jabbar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the last time the Sixers made the finals?
No, they've always been irrelevant.
Sort of--they mostly are, but during the AI years they were decent.
Okay. And?
Remember when they were in the finals against the Lakers?
That was way back in the mid 90's?
No, 2001.
Oh, feels forever. Hahaha
Very funny. Anyway...
Did you have a point?
Well, I saw AI on TV and was just remembering the finals.
What was so interesting about them?
Well, when the Sixers won, it was by just a couple of points. But their losses were blowouts.
Seriously?
Yeah, AI scored almost 50 and the Sixers won in overtime by 6.
What about the other 4 games?
They lost 98-89, 96-91, 100-86, and 108-98.
Those aren't blowouts.
I guess they just seemed like it at the time.
Might just be size: tiny AI vs huge Kobe and Shaq.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Golden State Warriors game on Saturday?
Yeah, they are looking tough.
I don't think they can be stopped this year.
The Cavs will give them trouble in the finals.
I don't think so. They're too good.
That's what everyone said last year.
Cavs got lucky last year. Steph Curry was hurt and Draymond Green was suspended.
Those are just excuses.
Besides, they added a certain player named Kevin Durant this year...KD
It's messed up their rhythm
Did you see the game on Saturday? He had 29 points.
Yeah, and Steph only had 16 and Klay only had 6.
Yeah, and they won by double digits! That's my point.
They aren't playing Lebron and the Cavs though
I don't care who they play. No team can stop Klay Thompson, Steph, and KD on the same team.
If anyone can, it's Lebron.
We'll see.
We will see. I think the Cavs will do it. Don't ever bet against Lebron
No one will beat Golden State this year.
The cavs will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey i haven't been following NBA lately, what's going on?
You serious!? It's the playoffs!
I know, I know, i want to get back into it I have just been busy at school.
Understandable, well like I said it is the playoffs.
What is going on? Who is left?
Well, teams are battling for a chance in their respective conference finals.
I'm guessing the cavs and warriors are still in it?
Yeah, of course they are.  The celtics are still playing the wizards.
How's James Harden doing, is he still cooking it up this year?
Harden actually blew it the other night, had an awful game and ended the Rockets playoff run and season.
What did he do!?  He was like one of my favorite players.
He only made TWO shots all game and had like 6 turnovers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Minnesota.
Why?
They've got crazy plays.
Like, what?
They always lose the plot.
In a good way?
In a good way.
What about them exactly?
Offense, yeah?
I'm not really sure about that.
They always play run-ups.
Yeah, but that's old playbook.
It's fun.
It's basketball from the 80s.
I like seeing it.
It's so boring.
I love the dunks.
I don't like the dunks.
I lose my stuff when there's a dunk.
It's bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about them Kings? Really got fleeced by the sixers?
How so? What happened?
Well, they traded Stauskas, picks, and pick swaps for nothing and It didn't work.
True, they needed to clear space for free agents and they got none anyway.
Yea, and now they have the 5th pick instead of the 3rd because of it.
Wow, that could be a big difference.
Yea, and they also lose a few pick.
Yea, that will probably be a valuable one too. They always suck.
Has Stauskas amounted to anything?
Yea, hes a good player.
Interesting. That sounds like a win for the Sixers.
Hinkie does it again.  The guy is good.
Talk to me when the Sixers start winning.
Listen, just trust the process.
Oh, the process, huh? I'm trusting
Good! Theres a lot of good things going on in Philly.
I know. They will start winning eventually.
Maybe, but only if they can stay healthy.
Yea, thats still to be determined.
It sure is, but only time will tell I g uess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who won yesterday's game?
The Lakers won the game.
Really? What was the score?
The score was 91 to 97.
Oh wow! That's a pretty close score.
Yeah. The other team had a really good defense.
Does this mean the Lakers will be at the championship this year?
I don't know. They still have one more game to decide.
Do you know who they will be playing next?
No, not yet. Are you a Lakers fan?
Not originally, but my team is out of the run for championship so I'm rooting for the Lakers.
Who's your favorite player?
Probably Lou Williams, he's pretty good.
I'm going to have to say D'Angelo Russels.
Which one has the highest points for the team?
Williams does, but I still like Russels.
Fair enough. Who is your second favorite player?
Williams is my second favorite, but I'm also a fan of Randle.
Who got the most points in yesterdays game?
Russels got the most points yesterday.

Do you do the whole March Madness thing?
You mean do I try to fill out the brackets?
Well, that, but also do you watch all the games?
No, I like basketball, but that's too many games.  I watch a good amount and check out scores and highlights for others.
Do you have a favorite team?
My alma mater, of course.  College teams change pretty rapidly though.
Yeah, I guess there's a lot of player turnover as they graduate and bring in new talent.
Yup.  You like basketball?
It's okay.  My brother played in high school and I think it ups the tension and excitement when you know someone playing.
Yeah, it does.  Was your brother any good?
Yes, he was.  Won quite a few games, went to state.
Huh, well good for him.
He still plays, you know, pick-up games and with his friends.
He must really like it.
Yeah, he played football and baseball in school, too, but basketball was always his game of choice.
So, he's into March Madness, too, I bet.
Yes, he is.  He will watch games on his phone and honestly I think the screen is just too small to catch everything.
I don't know, with how clear the picture is with phones now, you can see a lot.
Basketball is a lot of very quick action that covers a lot of distance on the court, so I think it needs a bigger screen so you don't miss anything.
You might be right, but sometimes all th matters is who is winning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between South Carolina and Gonzaga?
I did and it was pretty competitive.
What was the final score?
South Carolina had 73 and Gonzaga had 77.
Oh, I see. Who lead the teams in scoring?
Dozier had 17 points for South Carolina while Williams Goss had 23 points for Gonzaga.
I understand. How many assists did both teams get?
South Carolina had 12 assists while Gonzaga got 15 assists.
What about turnovers?
South Carolina only had 5 turnovers while Gonzaga had 12 turnovers.
I got you. Do you know how many rebounds both teams had?
Yes, South Carolina had 36 rebounds and Gonzaga had 41 rebounds.
I see, so Gonzaga had a sleight edge in rebounds.
That is correct.
Can you tell me about field goal shooting?
Yes, South Carolina hit 38% while Gonzaga hit 48%.
Oh, so Gonzaga shot the ball better than South Carolina.
That's correct. South Carolina is know more for their defense.
So, basically the game was decided by shooting?
That's correct. Gonzaga simply hit more shots than South Carolina and that is why they won the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Do you like basketball?
Yeah, I'm a huge fan of the NCAA!
Nice, me too! I prefer the ACC bracket.
Oh, I bet you're a Duke fan.
Definitely not! I'm a Tarheel basketball fan through and through.
I bet you were happy with the March Madness winner this year then!
Oh yes! That game was ugly though.
Yeah, both teams were pretty sloppy.
Justin Jackson didn't hit a single three, and that really hurt us.
And then their big guy fouled out, so that helped you guys a lot.
Well, our big guy had hurt both ankles, so the way he played was really impressive.
He won best player for the tournament, didn't he?
Yeah, Berry had 22 points in the final.
And he made some kind of steal at the end, right?
Yep! He made the big steal at the end that got the ball to Jackson.
The game was pretty much over at that point.
I was so excited, they'd worked really hard.
You gotta feel bad for Gonzaga, though.
For sure, that team played really hard.
Their coach is really a stand up guy too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you watch the Warrior/Spurs game last night?
Yes, not surprised to see the Warriors win again.
Kevin Durant was on fire.
He is amazing to watch as he can drive to the hoop or hit a 3 pointer.
Who would you rather have on your team, James or Durant?
Wow, what a question. I would take Durant because he is younger.
Crazy to see that Cleveland and Golden State are undefeated in the playoffs.
Absolutely as they are both 10 and 0.
Who do you thing will win the NBA title.
I would put my money on Cleveland.
I watched some of the Cleveland game the other night and I was just shocked to see how much James gets away with on the court.
I know. I watched him run over a guy, take six steps, run over a second guy and dunk it with no foul called.
Have you heard anything about the growth hormone James is supposedly taking?
Only that it builds muscle without going to the gym.
I am guessing one of these days the NBA will outlaw such a supplement.
Those players not using the supplement are at a disadvantage.
What team do you think is on the verge of really getting good?
I think my pick would be the Milwaukee Bucks.
Why do you think they are your guess.
Because they have a 7 foot 2 guy they call the Greek freak who can handle the ball, shoot 3's and drive past other 7 footers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Lebron James will surpass Michael Jordan as the greatest basketball player?
I think Lebron will probably surpass many of Michael Jordan's records, but until he wins more championships, it is too early to say.
In what ways do you think Lebron is a better player than Michael Jordan?
Lebron is bigger and stronger than Jordan.  He also seems to be a better passer and rebounder.
How is Michael Jordan better than Lebron?
Michael Jordan was more dominant and clutch.  He was an unstoppable scorer and one of the best defensive players.
Do you think Michael Jordan won championships with less talent on his teams than Lebron?
Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen, but Lebron had the Big Three- Lebron, D-Wade, and Chris Bosh in Miami.  Jordan had it much harder.
Where do you think Kobe is in regards to Michael Jordan and Lebron as the greatest of all time?
Kobe was the best of his time, but Michael Jordan is still greatest of all time.  Lebron is the best overall basketball player.
What makes Michael Jordan so much greater than the rest?
Jordan completely dominated the game offensively and defensively.  He made a good team and great team by getting double and triple teamed, making it easier for his teammates to score.
Do you think Lebron will continue to improve and evolve his game?
Lebron is getting better every season.  He is now getting better at this three point shooting making him a complete scorer.
Do you think Shaq could have been one of the greatest, if not the greatest player if he could hit free throws?
If Shaq could make free throws he would have been the most dominant player the game has ever seen.
Do you think Steph Curry and Kevin Durant will become the next top players in the league?
Curry is already breaking many three point records and has won a championship.  Durant is an unstoppable scorer but still hasn't won a championship yet.
Who do you think is the better duo, Durant and Curry or Lebron and Kyrie Irving?
I think Durant and Curry are a better duo that can dominate from anywhere on the court.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's watching the NBA Playoffs?
I am. Let's hurry up and get to the conference finals.
Who do you like?
Golden State will take it easily.
What about the East?
That's a little more up for grabs. Boston could give Cleveland a run.
You think the Celtics can beat the Cavs?
I think they can be competitive, you never know.
Lebron will smash them.
Maybe, maybe not. It could get interesting.
Do you think the Rockets can put up a fight if they play Golden State?
Harden is good, but c'mon. I'd be shocked if if Golden State didn't win it all.
I think the Rockets can beat them if things go right.
If you feel that way you should bet on Rockets. That'd be a nice return.
I'm not betting on the Rockets. I just think they can make it more interesting than people make it out to be.
If it's GS vs. Houston, how many games do you think Rockets win in that series?
I think they can win a home game at least. Maybe another one or two.
So overall how do you see the Finals shaping up?
Warriors vs. Cavs, Golden State in 6.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Kings and the Lakers?
Yeah they were really intense.
Those teams really hate each other!
Yeah it's been a big rivalry since like... forever.
Even back in the 90s?
Yeah of course in the 90s!
Why do you say that?
Well back them it was Shaq and Kobe vs Webber and Bibby!
Oh yeah, I remember Shaq and Kobe but not the other two.
Yeah they aren't as famous but they are arguably as good as them
Are their jerseys like hanging up at the King's stadium?
I know Webber's number is retired though.
What about Bibby?
I don't think his is retired.
Do you think they will be rivals forever?
Oh yeah, it's basically a NorCal and SoCal thing.
True, Norcal and Socal think they are both the best.
That's how a lot of rivalries happen, just depending on location.
Sometimes it is within one state, or across the whole country!
True. I think a lot of people just like to find a team to hate!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember who won the 2014-2015 NBA finals?
Yeah, the Golden state Warriors won the title.
Who did they play against in the finals?
They were playing against Cleveland Cavaliers.
Who was the MVP that season?
I think it was Andre Iguodala from the Golden State Warriors.
Who were the NBA 2010-2011 champions?
As far as I remember it was the Dallas Mavericks who won the title.
Was Derrick Rose the MVP that season or was it someone else?
Yes, you're right, it was Derrick Rose from Chicago Bulls.
Who scored the highest during the 2010 - 2011 season?
I believe it was Kevin Durant from Oklahoma City.
Did the Cavaliers win the 2016 NBA title?
Yes, the Cavaliers won with a final score of 93 and the Golden state Warriors scored 89.
Did Lebron James win the MVP title for the 2015-2016 NBA season?
Yes, Lebron James won and he made Cleveland very proud.
Did Lebron james play for Miami Heat during the 2012-2013 NBA season?
Yes, he did and they won the championship. He was also the MVP that season.
Who did the Miami Heat play against during that season?
I think they played against the San Antonio Spurs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
How are you doing today?
Very well and you?
Great.  You a basketball fan?
I am a fan.
Who is your team?
I don't really have a team, but I like some players.
Oh okay, what players do you like?
I like the superstars.
Like steph and lebron?
Yeah I like watching them play.
It is great to see them play.  Ever see them live?
No I haven't.  Have you?
I have seen a few Hawks games live.
Oh really?  How was that?
It was a blast.
That sounds like fun.
Have a good day.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whether or not the East is weaker than the West.
Everybody in this league are professionals for a reason and you cannot deny how good the Cavs look right now.
I feel the Celtics are 2 years ahead of schedule.
Right, they had a great season AND have the #1 pick.
They call it a Basketball Team for a reason, you play and you win as a team.
Your right, one player shouldn't make that much of a difference.
I like how Pops doesn't sugarcoat a failed and disappointing game!
Right, He focuses on the next game and what needs to be done! Admitting a failure and moving on.
The rest of the playoffs aren't even worth watching.
Your right, lets just skip ahead to the championship.
Do you watch NBA Inside tonight?
Yes, those GIFs are the best!
I'm not sure who is getting blown out worse: Celtics or Spurs??
I'm ready to just get the finals started.
Wait till next year the Bulls are more competitor than them if rondo is not injured it will be a massive match up agains the Cavs.
And by better match up you mean another sweep?
What is the Best series of all time?
Easy the Bulls vs Pistons in the late 80's early 90's
Who do you have winning and in how many?
I saw the Cavs in 5.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the game between the Celtics and the Wizards?
It was a really close game!
Yea, I really thought the Celtics were going to close out the series.
Yea me too, I didn't expect that.
The Wizards are hard to beat at their home stadium.
That's for sure.
Are you planning to watch the Spurs and Golden State Warriors game on Sunday?
Yes, I think that'll be a really interesting game to watch.
I agree, that'll be Golden State's toughest test to date in the playoffs.
Hopefully Kawhi Leonard will be healthy for the game...
Yea that'll give the Spurs a better chance to beat the Warriors.
Lemarcus Aldridge needs to play well in this series also.
True, he is starting to pick up his productions in the playoffs.
Yea, this may help them have a chance against the Warriors.
Also, the Spurs need better bench productivity as Tony Parker is hurt.
I concur. They need to rely on their back up point guards to play well.
Patty Mills has to run the team effectively in Tony Parker's place.
I think so too. Patty Mills needs to run the offense well and continue to shoot well.
However, with that being said I still think Golden State will win easily.
Yea I think the series will not go past five games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever think a no. 16 seed will beat a no. 1 seed in the tournament?
No, of course not.
Why is that?
I'm totally on board for the no. 1 seed to lose to an 8/9 in the second round, but there is too much discrepancy.
Everyone keeps getting better, though.
Yeah, but the rich keep getting richer. And the committee makes it nearly impossible for the small guys to win.
It's even more apparent in the women's tournament.
How so?
Well, in the mens, there are usually 8-10 teams who could realistically win the whole thing.
And in the womens?
It'll be UConn, Stanford, Notre Dame, or South Carolina.
Every year?
Close enough. Since 2000, UConn has won 10 champsionships.
Who else has won it all?
South Carolina this year, Baylor, Texas A&M, Maryland, Tennessee, and Notre Dame.
So 7 different champions in 17 years, that's not good.
No, it's not. They're all top seeds, too.
How's that compare to the men?
Lots of top seeds, but more variety: UNC, Villanova, Duke, UConn, Louisville, Kentucky, Kansas, Florida, Syracuse, Maryland, Michigan State.
And, lower seeds, too. Got it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How has the game of basketball changed over the years?
The modern game of basketball is less physical and more skilled.  Players are shooting more three pointers in the modern game.
Who do you think is the best basketball player in the modern era?
I think Lebron James is the best overall basketball player in the modern era.  Steph Curry is the most skilled shooter in the modern era.
Who do you think should win the NBA MVP this year?
Westbrook and Harden had great seasons.  Lebron and Curry are always in the running, but I think this year Westbrook deserves the MVP.
What do you think of the NBA super teams being assembled?
I think they are fun to watch because they play at such a high level and dominate the competition.  However, the make the season a little predictable.
Do you think Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan would be able to play in the modern NBA?
I think Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan would dominate and adapt to the modern NBA.  The game was more physical during their era.
Is Lebron more like Magic Johnson or Michael Jordan?
Lebron is very unique.  He can score like Michael Jordan, and pass like Magic.
Do you think D-Wade should have stayed with the Miami Heat?
I think D-Wade was a Miami Heat franchise player, but playing for his hometown must also be fun for him.
Who do you think was more important to the Heat winning championships: D-Wade or Lebron?
I think D-Wade was the true leader of the Miami Heat, but Lebron was the main scorer.
Do you think D-Wade is past his prime now?
D-Wade has suffered some injuries and is getting older.  He isn't Flash Wade anymore, but he is still a top player and a champion.
Do you think Lebron will win another championship this year?
I doubt that the Cavs can beat the Warriors with Durant this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what happened with the dream team?
What do you mean? What happened with it?
I guess I mean why was it such a big deal?
Oh. it was a big deal because it was the first time professional athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics.
That kinda goes against the spirit of the olympics.
Says the losers.
No. The Olympics has always been a forum for dedicated amateur athletes.
Says the losers. And no, Olympic athletes have national, corporate, and other supports. How is a professional athlete any different. they just make money
Anyway the dream team.
Ahh yes, the dream team. They won every game by an average of 44 points over their opponents. an din the finals they beat Croatia by 117 to 85.
That seems reasonable seeing as how they're pros
Yep. In the 1988 Olyimpics, we only took 3rd place, because we sent in college kids. To play against national teams from all over the world. Now that's what's unfair.
Well our national team made up of college kids still got the support they needed, I bet.
Sure.
So it WAS fair.
No it wasn't, Because we weren't allowed to send in our best.
So... Unless you send in your best, it's not fair for you. Is that it?
That's exactly how it is.
So who was the best player on the team?
So get this, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, Larry Byrd, Patrick Ewing, Scotty PIppen, Clyde Dexter, Christian Laettner, Chris Mullens, Karl Malone, And David Robinson all played 8 games. of all of them Barkley had the highest FGM stat at 59. HIs percentage was the highest too. 0.711.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you tell me you hate the NBA. Why?
Oh, a massive multitude of reasons. I'll tell you over the course of 9 turns.
Okay, that's weirdly specific, but go ahead.
The referees don't penalize flopping.
What's that?
When a guy gets lightly bumped on the shoulder and somehow manages to fall about 20 feet. They do it in soccer too, but not as dramatically.
Ha, LeBron is good at that.
Sadly, yes. And it's not punished. Sadly, you can't confirm or deny when someone is off-balance naturally or not.
How else do you hate the NBA?
They don't call traveling. The players pretty much can do whatever they want and it's all good.
And?
Even bigger, if a guy gets fouled, then throws a ball up and it goes in, it counts as it's part of the shot.
Yeah, it is.
No, it's not. Unless he's actively shooting with the ball over his head, he's NOT shooting.
What is it, then?
He's throwing up the ball AFTER the foul, and getting rewarded for it.
Ahh, yeah that's a bit annoying.
Plus, these guys make tens of millions acting like babies and being awful role models.
All for playing a game...
I wish I could be a professional Cards Against Humanity player. Same level of being a jerk, but no rules.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the Oklahoma City Thunder?
I know of them but not specifically, no.
Does Durant still play for them?
No, he's in Oakland now.
Who's in Oakland?
Oh, the Golden State Warriors.
Oh, OK. Do you miss the Supersonics?
Yeah, I miss them in Seattle.
The Thunder moved to OKC from Seattle.
Yes, I know that.
I heard Bill Gates was trying to get another team there, in Seattle.
Yeah, I heard Russell Wilson supporting that too.
Random thought: I still like Lebron.
Me too.
Even after he left Cleveland but before he went back, I still liked him.
Yeah, never understood people who hated him.
Maybe they're too poor to see a real NBA game.
Maybe, or maybe they don't have another NBA team to really like.
Or they're in Minnesota and stuck with the T-Wolves.
That's possibly true too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
NBA playoffs are unreal this year. Are you watching it?
Yes I am. I can't believe all that has happened so far.
The only problem is that all the top seeds are winning. Exciting games but boring results on paper.
I'm actually not a fan of upsets.
Are you serious? Don't you find this stuff boring when no under dogs win?
From what I see, under dogs winning makes for exciting first couple of rounds. But boring in the finals.
Good point. At least the games are exciting. Game winning shots, big players stepping up.
Did you see John Wall hit that three last night?
I know! He isn't even a three point shooter!
That shot, with the game on the line is amazing. The guy has ice water in his veins.
Have you ever hit a game winning shot in a basketball game?
No. When I was in high school I took a shot at the end of a game to win, but I missed it.
Heart breaker! What position did you play in basketball.
I was shooting guard.
Were you a good shooter?
Not really. I wasn't a very good dribbler so I couldn't be a point guard. But I also wasn't tall, so I couldn't be a power forward or center.
I played center. I was tall but not very coordinated.
I still like to play basketball. I just don't have as much time.
Same with me. I try to watch the NBA whenever I can though.
I sure hope it is the warriors and cavs in the finals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the playoff game last night?
You mean the Celtics versus the Wizards blowout?
Yeah, the Celts killed it.
Bradley was on fire all night. It was a good game.
They're up 3-2 now. There's noway the Wizards can come back from that.
I wouldn't count them out just yet.
You think so?
They could pull an upset and turn the series around.
I don't know. After last night's game I don't see it happening.
Wall did a pretty good job for the Wizards. He was the highest scorer I think.
Yeah but it wasn't enough.
Don't forget, the Celtics did have home court advantage too.
You implying that my team can't win on the road?
You said it, not me.
We'll see. The Wizards are at home for the next game.
They have to win or at least put up a better fight than last night.
It should be interesting, but I don't expect the Wizards to pull off a win.
Do you want to bet on it?
Fifty dollars says the Celtics will wrap it up Friday night.
Deal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like basketball?
Yeah, I do I used to play?
Really, at what level?
Just college. Do you follow pro ball?
Yes, I do. Who is your favorite team?
I like the Jazz alot. How about you?
I do not really have one, but maybe the Lakers.
Oh yeah, they are great. Do you have a favorite current player?
Steph Curry for sure, how about you?
I would have to go with Lebron James.
I thought he was retired?
Not really not yet. Maybe he will pull a Jordan.
I could see him plating pro in other stuff, who is your favorite old school or retired player?
Shaq, and you?
I would go with Jordan.
Do you think Curry will get traded any time soon?
No, he is doing really well I wonder if James Harden will though.
You think so? I doubt it. He is pretty solid.
You may be right. Do you follow his team alot?
I do, I think I like his as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Spurs play the Rockets last night?
I sure did!  What a crazy game!
I can't believe that the Spurs won by almost 40 points.
Yeah, no one predicted that, especially since they were playing in Houston.
And the Spurs won without Kawhi Leonard or Tony Parker!!  Who would believe that?
I know, it's nuts!  And the Rockets just looked terrible.
James Hardin looked particularly bad.
Yeah, what was wrong with him?  He looked like he didn't want to even be there.
So many of the Spurs really stepped up their game.  I was really impressed!
I agree!  Patty Mills and and especially LaMarcus Aldridge were great!
I can't believe that the Spurs won the series!  My mind is still spinning!
I know!  It's so awesome!
Do you think that Kawhi will play in the game against Golden State on Sunday?
I don't know, his ankle seemed pretty bad the other night.
Do you think that the Spurs have any chance of winning the series against Golden State?
Unfortunately, no, I don't think they can.
Me neither.  Golden State is just too good.
Yeah, no one can beat Steph Curry and Kevin Durant.
Do you think that Golden State will win the championship then?
Yeah, I think they will face Cleveland in the finals and beat them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How bad do the Spurs miss Leonard?
Its terrible what he meant to the team.
Cant someone else step up?
You would think so, right?
I thought Pop was a better coach then this.
You couldnt put this on him.
They are getting destroyed by Golden State though
The problem is they are getting no secondary scoring
So the bench is outpacing the Spurs?
Even Warriors best bench players are outperforming much of San Antonio's lineup.
Think they miss Duncan?
No, hes too old anyway
How about Parker
He was a great facilitator but I think his time is up too
Wow could this be the end for the team?
No Pop runs a well oiled machine.
But Golden State could survive without Durant or Green or Curry
I am not sure thats the case
So Curry means that much to a team that already has studs everywhere?
Yeah pretty much thats what I am saying
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Western Conference Finals is finally set.
Yes.  The Spurs and the Warriors.
It feels like this is the matchup everyone has been waiting for this entire season.
It sure feels that way. Who do you think will win?
Oh, I think you have to go with the Warriors.  I mean they haven't lost a single game in the playoffs yet.
That is amazing.  I too think the Warriors are the favorite.
I don't think you can ever write off the Spurs though.
Well yea.  Parker goes out for the season, Kawhi gets hurt, and yet the beat the Rockets.
Yes.  It seemed like everyone wrote off the Spurs, and then all of a sudden they destroyed the Rockets.
That Game 6 performance shows what the Spurs are capable of if they are firing on all cylinders.
Agreed, and they did that without Kawhi, their best player.
I think they have to play a similar way against the Warriors.
Yes, you are right.  You can't match small on small with the Warriors or try to shoot 3s with them.
Yes, nobody can beat the Warriors playing that way.  Well maybe except the Cavaliers.
But the Spurs don't have that kind of firepower.  I think they need to stay big and try to play inside.
I agree.  They need huge games from Aldridge and Gasol.
Yes.  That margin for error is super thin.  I don't think those big guys can even have one game where they play poorly.
You are right.  If the Spurs pull of the upset, it will probably take 7 games.
And they are going to need Gasol and Aldridge to play well in all 7 games.
And of course, they need Kawhi back healthy and playing at a high level.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the NBA playoffs this year?
Yes. I am watching the playoffs, especially the Warriors and Cavs games.
Do you think the Warriors and Cavs will sweep all the teams during the playoffs?
So far it seems like they will sweep their way to finals.
Do you think coach Steve Kerr not being able to coach will affect the Warriors?
It will have some effect, but I think the Warriors are a good enough team to win even without Kerr coaching.
Who do you think is the best player on the Golden State Warriors?
I think Kevin Durant is the better overall player, but Steph Curry is the best shooter on the team.
Do you think Lebron can win more championships than Michael Jordan?
Lebron is still young and in his prime.  If he stays healthy and on good teams, he has a chance.
Do you think Lebron James is becoming a better three point shooter?
So far in the playoffs this year, it seems like Lebron is adding the three point shot to his arsenal.
Do you think Steph Curry will become the all time leader in three pointers?
If he stays healthy and continues to play at a high level, he is on his way to becoming the all time best three point shooter.
Do you think Kevin Durant will be able to win a championship this year?
Joining the Warriors gave Durant the best chance of winning a championship this year.
Do you think the Warriors versus the Cavs will become a good rivalry?
If the teams stay together for many years, they will probably face each other a few more times in the finals.
Do you think the Warriors might be able to sweep the Cavs this year?
The Warriors are a great team, but Lebron and Cavs should be able to win a few games, maybe even the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the most exciting play in basketball?
College or NBA?
It doesn't matter.
The tip-off.
...seriously?
No, silly, they don't even try. I like the game-ending three-quarter-court shot.
Okay, let me specify. What's the most exciting regularly-occurring play in basketball?
For me, that would have to be the posterization.
Really? I don't like that at all.
Why not? One guy jumps up and dunks on top of another. It's humiliating.
It's too much showmanship, and it's unnecessary. There are other ways to get two points that don't involve putting someone's head between your legs.
So, what's yours?
I like the three-pointer that absolutely kills a rally.
How's that work?
Say a team is down by 10 with two minutes to go but have been making a comeback. They get it to within two points.
Okay...
Then, as they're about to take the lead, the other team takes control on a fast break and scores a three-pointer.
Why's that your favorite?
It's completely demoralizing. It crushes the other team, the fans, and the hopes.
True...but cruel, man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the NBA season should be cut to 50 games.
It would be more exciting.
And maybe cut the playoffs in half.
Thats alot of missed revenue.
Well some teams that make it have a record under 500.
Yeah but cutting the playoff teams in half doesnt fix that.
Sure it does, eliminate the first round.
Why not have everyone make it at that point?
Well that renders the regular season useless.
No, you would still need it for seeding purposes.
I dont think you need it for that, you need it to make money to pay salaries.
Well salaries would take a dip but why would the owners care about that
Their revenues would be cut in half.
OK so keep the playoffs the same but cut the regular season down?
Thats what I am saying.
I just dont see how they would lose that money and be OK with it.
The problem is you know the playoffs are set by February.
Not true, the bottom teams are always scraping.
I would like a playoff format where the best teams get byes. Its only fair.
This isnt football, that makes no sense.

yes. I like basketball.
Have you been to any games?
Yes. I have been to a HS game. Have you been to a professional game?
I have not been to a professional game. I want go to.
I may be able to get tickets soon.
If you can, let me know. I would like to go. Whats your favorite team.
I like the raptors in Toronto.
I'm from New York, I like the Knicks. I wish I could go to Madison square garden.
Is that where the Kicks play?
Yes. It is a grand stadium for baksetbal games. Other events as well.
Who is the best player on the Knicks?
To me the best player is Patrick Ewing.
Does he still play for them?
No. He dose not. He was really good.
Nice. My favorite player is Kobe Bryant.
Deseon't he play for the Lakers?
Yes. But he is so good. I would like to see him play in a stadium.
Very well. I like basketball.
mr too. baksetball is fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Houston/Spurs game?
Yeah, James Harden played terribly.
Do you think it will hurt his MVP chances?
I would imagine so. You going to watch Warriors/Spurs?
For sure, I think it will be a great series.
Me too. The Spurs have a shot.
Do you think they could win?
I don't know if they could win, but I think they can win a few games at least.
Only if Kawhi Leonard is okay, I think.
His ankle is fine, so he'll be playing.
Oh really? I hadn't heard.
Yeah, the coach said he will play game 1 on Sunday.
That's good news for the Spurs. Do you think they could win without him?
Win the series? Not a chance.
Agreed. They could win a game or two but not the series.
Do you think they could win the whole thing?
I'm not sure. I think it will be a Cavs/Warriors final again.
Me too, which is a shame.
Why is it a shame?
I just miss when the league was more competitive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, are you watching the NBA playoffs?
Yes I am! I have to watch every game
What do you think of how it went so far?
It's been so one sided and unfair
Ya, both teams are going to sweep their way into the finals
Everyone knew Cleveland would win though
Yea, Boston has no chance. And now Isaiah Thomas is injured, Cleveland has it in the bag
Yea. But the Warriors look like they will sweep too
Yea, after Zaza's dirty play, I think the Spurs have no chance
They don't have Kawhi or Parker. They won't be doing anything this year unfortunately
So it looks like we will have 2 teams sweep their way into the finals
Yea, it'll be a Golden State versus Cleveland finals, yet again
Yea, we knew that all season long
Well, in the playoffs, some of the first 2 round games were exciteding
Maybe just the Wizards and Celtics and the Rockets and Thunder were the ones that were entertaining
I really wish the Rockets or Thunder made it further though. The Western Conference is stacked
Yea that would have been nice
Well, who do you have winning it all now?
Cleveland of course, yet again
I agree. Lebron is at his prime
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the Spurs Warriors playoff matchup?
Yeah, when is the first game.
They play this Sunday May 14th at 3:30 pm.
That should be a great series.
Do you know if Leonard is back from his injury? He didnt play the end of the Rockets series.
Thats right. Yeah I actually read on ESPN that he will be ready to go for game one against the warriors.
Where are they playing the first game?
The Warriors have the better record so they will be in Oakland for Game 1.
Who is playing in the Eastern Conference Finals?
Well definetly the Cavaliers, but the Wizards and Celtics are still playing their series.
Who do you think will win?
I hope the Wizards will win, but I think the Celtics are going to win.
Yeah, Isiah Thomas is a great player and I dont think Wall and Beal can match up against the Celtics well.
Yeah, who knows though the Wizards did just play a great game to send it back to Boston.
I think the Finals will be Cleveland and the Warriors. What about you?
Well definetly Cleveland, I cant see another team beating them in the East.
What about the Warriors?
I do not know the Spurs are playing great and just defeated the Rockets who were playing great.
Yeah thats true but do you really think they can beat Thompson, Curry, Green at thier best?
No, but you dont know if they will play that well this series. It will be a great series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have been watching the Celtics Wizards series
Yea it's been awesome so fa
yes very physical both teams just don't like each other
I know one player from the wizards was suspended for a game for starting a fight
he should have be suspended for the series
The home court advantage has been unreal
yes no road victory so far for either team
The scoring streaks have been off the charts
yea the wizards ran off 26 straight in game four
And then the celtics came back and won the next game
I know go figure, two games left who do you want to win
I the the wizards are dirty players so I'm pulling for Boston
Yea me too but the next game is in washington
maybe it  will be the first road win
could be but I doubt it the way things have been going so far
I agree it's more hope than a prediction
I know what you mean but the final game is back in bean town
that should send the celtics to the finals in the east
But look who they have to play next
Cleveland will crush either team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the 76ers are a playoff team next year?
Depends on the health of their players.
Who is more imporant to be on the court?
Embiid has to be.
Why do you think that?
He is generational when healthy.
He can shoot the 3.
I dont even know if they want him doing that.
He is good in the low post too.
Thats why I say hes generational.
Tall guys like that have knee problems always.
Yeah and hes had everything wrong with him including the foot.
I think its time they are all healthy.
They will be scary with Embiid and Simmonds and whomever they draft.
If I were them and they get 2 and 4 in the lottery, I would trade for the number 1.
I agree they dont need 2 players, they need the best player.
They dont need anything, they need to win.
We all do.
Its about time, their fans have been patient.
I would say so, pretty rough for that crew.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I guess the finals will be Warriors vs Cavs again, huh?
I guess so. I can't believe how awful these conference finals have been!
Every game has been a blow out.
Not only that, the Spurs and Celtics both lost their best player.
Oh yeah, right. Spurs haven't had Kawhi since game 1, Celtics just lost IT for the rest of the play-offs.
I mean I'm sure the Warriors and Cavs were winning anyway, but these games aren't even competitive.
It sucks, but what can you do? Guys are resting all season but you can't stop in game injuries.
Exactly. And that whole resting thing needs to stop. Guys are going to get injured.
I just hope the finals aren't the same way. One major injury could be the deciding factor.
I agree. Both teams need to stay healthy so we can finally get a competitve series in this play-offs.
So who do you got anyway? Cavs or Warriors?
Oh, Warriors for sure. Kevin Love won't show up for the finals.
Wow, you think so? I thought he was decent last year. I'm more worried about Durant.
True, he did kind of disappear when OKC made the finals, but he's much more mature now.
I'm also interested in seeing if Draymond Green can keep his hot head under control.
No way. That guy is as animated as they come. I doubt he does anything for a suspension, but he WILL be loud every game.
So that's your only reason? Kevin Love? You don't think the Warriors are just better?
I just don't think LeBron can handle it all on his own. Kyrie will step up but they really need Kevin Love this year now that the Warriors are even more loaded.
I guess so. I still don't think anyone is stopping LeBron. He will average a triple double in the finals, I guarantee it.
We'll so about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a gripe about NCAA basketball.
Go ahead.
I hate when awesome division I powerhouses pay awful schools to play.
You mean, pay-to-lose?
Yup. It happens in football too.
Why does that bother you?
It doesn't improve the players on the team paying, and it uses up the school's money.
You really think the students are paying Alabama A&M $150,000 to lose to University of Florida--just for example?
I don't know where the money comes from, other than that it's a waste.
I LOVE when they do this, actually?
Why?
Well, let's say Duke pays The Citadel $250k to lose at Duke.
Duke pays The Citadel $250k to lose at Duke.
Very funny, you literalist. Anyway, I love when the lesser school that's paid to lose ... wins.
Ha, that's right. They spent the school's money to buy a win and didn't get it.
Love it.
That's not enough for me though. It happens rarely enough to be an anomaly.
You're one of those integrity guys aren't you?
Yeah, I think it ruins the game of basketball. There's no surprise, and the wrong kind of competition.
You're only saying that cause you were in the Atlantic Sun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the NBA playoffs at all?
Sort of, but I missed the Golden State Warriors vs. the Spurs today. Did you watch?
Yes! It was a really exciting game.
Which team won?
The Golden State Warriors won
What was the final score?
113 for Golden State and 111 for the Spurs
Oh wow, so it was pretty close then.
Yeah. The Spurs had a strong lead but lost it after Kawhi Leonard got injured in the third quarter.
Oh yikes. What kind of injury?
He hurt his ankle and had to sit out the rest of the game.
That's too bad. How did Steph Curry do in this game?
He did great! He scored 40 points.
He's so fun to watch. He's definitely one of the best shooters in the league.
I agree. He managed to tie the game with a 3 pointer with less than 2 minutes left.
Do you think he'll win MVP this year?
I doubt it, actually. I think Russell Westbrook is more likely.
Yeah he's been getting a lot of buzz. James Harden might be a strong contender too.
There's also always LeBron too!
True! We'll just have to wait and see I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Spurs and Warriors game last night?
I watched part of it.... Warriors just rolled over San Antonio!
Yea, looks like they are on the verge of a sweep.
I don't know, remember what happened last year to the warriors in the finals.
True, but this is a different team.
We will see!
The playoffs suck this year anyway
Yup too many injuries
I mean the Celtics are just embarrassing
I wonder how they'd be doing if they had Isaiah Thomas healthy
I think Cavs would still take it but it would have been a little more competitive
I guess we will never know
Well at least the Celtics have the first draft pick
This is true but some are saying they may trade it away
Did you see how the Mavs tanked at the end of the season
Yea why is everyone talking about it now?
I know right, it's like no sh*t sherlock, everyone saw that
I wonder if they are going to do anything next year
I can't believe Dirk is still playing
I think next season will be his last.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cavaliers are unbeatable.
I think the series with Golden State is gonna be great.
Don't be too quick to say that. The Spurs are not done yet.
Yeah, but Leonard is not gonna play game 4 either.
That is not good. Hopefully Golden State realizes that they beat an injured team.
I don't think it matters to them much.
Yeah, winning a title is all that matters to them.
Yeah, I heard Lowry wants to join a team where he will get a ring.
Yes, that is pretty disappointing.
He is like a person who marries another person for their money.
I'm a big Booker fan from the Suns.
Yeah, he wants to be on the Suns forever.
The finals will be good though.
Who do you think will win?
The Cavaliers.
I think Golden State will win.
Why?
Cause they have the top 2 players in the west.
Leonard is better than Durant and he doesn't swear at mascots.
Oh yeah, I saw Durant do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
How are you.
Find and you?
Good. Do you follow basketball?
Yeah I like basketball you?
Yeah I like it too.
Any team in particular?
I like Michigan.
Oh college cool.
Yeah don't really like NBA.
That's okay.
Season is too long.
I agree.
Also college is easier to route for for me.
Yeah I get that.  So no NBA?
No not really.
I see.
Take it easy.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Morning.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Well and you?
Not bad.  You like basketball.
I sure do.
Do you like NBA?
More of a college guy, but I do watch NBA from time to time.
Oh cool, I like college as well.
Who do you like?
In college?
Yeah?
I went to UCLA so the Bruins.
Oh okay.
You?
I like Louisville a lot, big Pitino fan.
I do like him too.
yeah.
Have a good one.
ok.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Warriors vs Spurs game?
I think it was pretty awesome!
Warriors just bowled them over.
Yeah they took a 3-0 lead.
Lee took a hit though.
Yeah, he wrecked his knee.
It's good to see that Coach Kerr is feeling better.
I think he must be from what I've heard.
Kerr is going to be traveling with the team to San Antonio.
I heard that he might be going with them. That is good to hear.
He has still been involved with the team throughout his illness though.
Yeah, it's not like he's been completely gone, he's been working with them by phone.
Bob Meyers confirmed his plans to travel with the team on the radio, so it must be true.
I heard that interview too.
I bet the players are going to be glad to get him back.
He is popular with the players, he's a good coach.
I can't wait to see them play in the next game.
Me too. I bet they will be pumped with the coach back.
The warriors have really been dominating. I hope they keep it up.
I am sure they will, they are a great team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the Lakers fired Mitch Kupchak?
Yeah, but Magic Johnson was named president so that is pretty cool.
I'm a huge fan of Magic Johnson.
Did you know that he was inducted in the basketball hall of fame twice?
At one point he was named the greatest point guard in the NBA.
I think Eric Bledsoe was really on fire.
Yeah it was a shame that he's having to sit out the rest of the season because of his knees.
My best friend was a great basketball player in high school but he messed up his knees too.
Was he a point guard?
Yeah, he was pretty good and was probably going to get a scholarship.
I think Kemba Walker has really been doing well.
Did you see the game with the Nuggets?
On ESPN they said he reached 8,000 career points so far in that game.
The Hornets were really lucky to get him for sure.
What else can you expect of a team owned by Michael Jordan?
I know, the man is a legend.
Did you catch the game between the Warriors and the Spurs last night?
Yeah, at first I thought it was going to be close but the Warriors pulled it out.
I got season tickets last year and I never missed a game.
We should go see a game next weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like that playoff matchup between the Celtics and Wizards last night?
Yeah, it was ok, but I wish it would have come down to a buzz beater.  I like the extra drama of a last second shot.
That definitely would have made it better, but did you see that dunk by Wall?
Oh yeah! It was awesome! It looked like it floated through air for five minutes.
I expected the Celtics to shoot better from behind the arc, did you notice that poor shooting?
I did.  I thought the same, since they shot so well during the regular season.  I think Thomas might be slightly hurt though.
He may have been, but why is shooting that many threes when he didn't make a single one?  I thought he should have been driving and slashing more, to create open shots for his teammates.
That's a good question.  He does seem to get focused on his own scoring too much.
How do you think this series turns out now?
I think they'll end up going to seven games.  Neither team seems to be able to win on the road.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who won last night's game between the Warriors and Spurs?
Warriors...big time?
Oh...how much did they win by?
A lot. I think it was over 20 points.
Let me check it out on the ESPN App
Yeah, that's a great app.
Oh many, 120-108...what a victory
Yikes, so does that mean they're up 3-0?
Yes, Warriors up 3-0
Geez, those guys are dominant
Yeah, it doesn't look like there will be much competition from the Spurs
Remember when the Spurs were great?
Yeah, very underrated team since 1999
Yeah, Tim Duncan was a very good player
But he didn't have any flashy moves so wasn't a big highlight guy
Yeah, the Big Fundamental
Greg Poppovich is a great coach as well
Yeah, I think he's probably thinking of retirement now
Really? I didn't hear about that
Well, just my own intuition. Nothing official yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember who won the 2000 NBA finals?
That's a long time ago, but I think it was the LA Lakers.
Was Shaquille O'Neal the MVP that season?
Yes, it was Shaquille O'Neal, you're right.
Did the LA Lakers win the 2001 NBA championship too?
Yes, they did, two times in a row?
Who did the Lakers win against in NBA 2001 finals?
It was the Philadelphia 76ers and the Lakers won the series, 4 games to 1.
What year did the San Antonia Spurs win in the last decade?
I think they won the 2007 NBA finals against the Cavaliers.
Was Tony Parker the MVP for the 2007 NBA season?
Yes, you're right, Tony Parker was the MVP of the 2007 NBA season.
Who is the owner and president of the LA Lakers?
I believe it is Jeanie Marie Buss.
Do the Clippers and the Lakers play home games in Staple Center?
Yes, they do share the same arena for home games but I was told they use different courts.
When was the Detroit Pistons last win?
I think the Pistons last won the NBA championship way back in 2004.
Who did the Detroit Pistons play against during the 2003-2004 season?
They played against the LA Lakers and won 4 out of 5 games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cavaliers seem unstoppable.
Yeah I don't know who can guard LeBron.
They will win back to back championships.
I don't see them beating Golden State.
You gotta be kidding.
No, I'm serious.
Who on Golden State can guard LeBron?
I would put Kevin Durant on him.
No one will stop LeBron.
It doesn't matter, Golden State has too many shooters.
Kevin Durant cannot guard LeBron.
You are missing the point.  Golden State has 4 or 5 people on the court at all times that can score.  Cleveland maybe has 3.
You think that will be the difference?
Absolutely, we'll concede that LeBron will get his points.
What if other Cavaliers are also scoring?
I really don't think it will matter, there is too much fire power on Golden State.
I think if Cleveland slows the game down they have a real chance.
If Cleveland slows the game down they just have a real chance of losing by less.
You are impossible.
I'm impossible to defend, like Golden State.  They will win two out of the last three championships.  Scoreboard!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's funny though?
What?
If we look at the points per game, Jabbar doesn't really rank that high.
But he's a legend everyone says.
Yep. Even was in that Kung Fu movie
What does he rank at, then?
He's at 14th in terms of points per game.
Who do you think can break Jabbar record?
His total points over career record?
Yes.
Hm. that's a tough one. We have to see who's most likely to last as long as Jabbar did
And score at least as much per game as he did.
Yep.
Can Lebron do it?
I'm thinking, if he stays healthy, yes. he's currently behind 9600 points to match Jabbar's record, and he's 499 games behind Jabbar
How long has Lebron been playing? 13 years?
Something like that. And he's still on his top game, more or less. And in a season there are 82 games, so, 6 more years which is about the same length of career as Jabbar
But he averages 27 points per game which is better than Jabbar.
Let's see, if Lebron plays all the games in the next 6 years, and scores the average he's been doing, then he will amass 13473 points which will shatter Jabbar's record
Now, will he, or can he stay healthy enough for that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Spurs will win it this year?
I dont know Kawhi is on fire.
Yeah I think the Pop always knows what to do in crunch time
The loss of Parker is not a big of a deal as it was in the past
Him and Ginobli are part time at this point
Yeah its a shame but the wheel keeps on spinning for Spurs
Pop knows what hes doing
Surprised none of that went with Brett Brown to Philly
What can you say? He hasnt been given talent
True but they got a bunch of guys
Who said they would be healthy?
No one, but they more than likely cant stay hurt
Embiid hasnt played 40 games yet!
All things even out
No reason to believe he will play this year
Doesnt matter, LeBron runs the East until he retires
Or goes out west
Could end up on the Spurs if he wants to win a few as a bench player
Nah he wont even come off the bench I bet
You are right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Celtics have a chance tonight?
No.
I heard they might be better off without Isaiah Thomas
That's nonsense. He's their best player
So how did they finish with a better record than the Cavs?
Lebron wasn't really trying, and his season doesn't start until the Finals.
They need to do something about that. It's not fun to have everything be meaningless until the Finals.
What can they do?
At least make sure the players play every night
But how do you do that?
Fine them if they sit out games?
You can't do that unless you want to start policing injuries.
What about refunding fans who go to games where stars don't play?
No team will ever do that.
The NBA needs to figure something out. Fans will lose faith in the sport.
I don't think so. It's more popular than ever.
Not really. I think lots of people think it's gotten too boring
But there are so many great players, even outside of the Cavs and Warriors.
Who won't win championships unless they team up with Lebron or a superteam.
Still it's fun to watch these guys play
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like Lebron's reaction to the snub?
I thought it was perfect when he said "This league knows what I bring to the table."
The same people who say they are tired of the same teams in the NBA finals every year will say they loved the NBA from 87-98.
EXACTLY!!!! When the Lakers, pistons, bulls and rockets were the only teams to win championships in that 12 year span
Whats your favorite "player"
Dirk, he is the best on and off the court.
Can you believe LeBron James will become the youngest player in NBA History to reach 50,000 career minutes tonight.
I know- that stat is crazy and what makes it better is how many games he's sat out.
Do you think De'Aaron Fox will be better than John Wall?
I don't know but thats a great comparison by Calipari.
Lavar keeps running his mouth to know end and last I checked he never won a NCAA Title, NBA title or was a NBA All Star.
Right...100% Great athletes surround themselves around other great athletes
King James passes Shaq for third in field goals made in the playoffs!
It won't be long till he's #1 in all playoff categories.
James stat line....first ever with  240+ points, 50+ rebounds, 50+ assists in first 7 games of Playoff year.
He is simple the best, I know there will always be comparisons to Jordon, but come on.
Did you watch any of the Cavs vs. Raptors series?
No way! That was a waste of everyones time.
Do you think Knick fans are to full of themselves?
Knicks fans are the Jets fans of the NBA
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best guard in NCSU's history?
That had to be Monte Towe.
Didn't he play professionally also?
Yes, for the Denver Nuggets.
David Thompson went there also, didn't he.
He may have for a while before going into motivational speaking based on his basketball career.
I know Monte didn't stay there long.
No, Monte coaches basketball now.
Where is he a coach?
UNC Asheville's basketball team.
Wasn't he also an assistant coach at NCSU?
Yes, he coached with Norm Sloan for a while.
NCSU had a good basketball team during that era, right?
Yes, their basketball team was number one for a season.
Then the next season they lost their first basketball game to Wake Forest, right?
Yes, and Wake Forest had a poor team at that time.
How is Wake Forest's basketball program.
It became great for a while.
But you don't hear much about Wake Forest or NCSU basketball anymore?
No, the era of great basketball players seems to be over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to the basketball game at school tonight?
Maybe. Who are we playing?
Larsonville. They always beat us.
Maybe they won't this time. We're good this year.
That's true. We beat Ashton and they always beat us too.
Max Howard is great.
He really is. I can't believe that touchdown he scored last week.
Wasn't that the tie breaker?
Yes. We won because of him.
I was elated and I normally don't care much about the game.
I don't either. I usually just go to see friends.
I think that's most of us.
Want to ride together then?
Sure. Can you pick me up a little early so we can get a seat?
Yes. I don't want to have to sit all the way at the top of the stands again.
Neither do I. I hate that.
So do I. It's hard to get anywhere if you want food or something.
I'll buy you a pretzel if you want one at the game.
I love those. This game is going to be so great.
If we win everyone's going to be so excited.
XXXXXXXXXXX
SO WHO DO YOU THINK WILL BE IN THE NBA FINALS?
I THINK IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE CAVS WILL PLAY THE WARRIORS AGAIN?
YEP THEY ARE THE TWO BEST TEAMS WITHOUT A DOUBT.
PLUS IT WILL MAKE IT A MORE INTERESTING FINALS AT LEAST.
ITS TOO BAD THOUGH THAT THE SPURS AND CELTICS BOTH HAD THEIR BEST PLAYERS INJURED.
THAT IS THE NATURE OF THE NBA THOUGH MY FRIEND.
YEP FOR SURE BUT STILL IT IS UNFORTUNATE.
I AGREE PLUS THE SEMI FINALS ARE NOT WATCHABLE ANYMORE.
I HAVE STOPPED WATCHING BECAUSE THERE IS ZERO DRAMA NOW.
WELL AT LEAST WE HAVE THE FINALS TO LOOK FORWARD TO. WHO DO YOU LIKE IN THE FINALS?
I'M A WARRIOR FAN SO OF COURSE I'M GOING WITH MY MAN CURRY.
HAHA I THINK LEBRON WILL HAVE ANOTHER GREAT SERIES LIKE LAST YEAR.
AS LONG AS IT GOES 7 GAMES I'M COOL WITH IT.
ME TOO MAYBE WE CAN PUT A SMALL WAGER ON THE FINALS.
OK HOW ABOUT 20 BUCKS?
YEP 20 IS COOL I DON'T WANT TO BANKRUPT YOU HAHA
HAHA WHAT'S 20 BUCKS AMONG FRIENDS.
OK WE WILL SHAKE ON DURING GAME ONE.
COOL MY BROTHER THATS A BET
ALL RIGHT MAN TALK TO YOU AT THE START OF THE SERIES.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever play basketball growing up?
Yes, I was in the kids leagues until 8th grade or so. You?
Yeah, I played until early high school. Why did you stop?
Well, I was forced to do it in the first place. And, bullying.
What happened?
They made us play shirts vs. skins, and the team captain every time said skins for us so I'd have to be shirtless.
So?
So, I'm fat. The point was to humiliate me.
That's awful. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I hard-fouled him a lot. I also just wasn't very good, despite my mom's assertions.
Yeah, parents are dumb and don't see truth a lot.
So why did you quit?
I got to the high school level and had stopped growing. You can't play high school basketball at 5'9"
Ha, true, unless you can dunk for the show. I was 6'1 when I quit and I wasn't tall enough anymore.
I also had a lot of injuries.
What did basketball do to you?
Well, I was the fat kid, remember? Wind sprints destroyed my knees. One time I hurt them bad but my brother convinced my family I was faking it.
How are they now?
They still hurt. And I have rotator cuff issues. You?
No injuries for me, luckily. Sorry about your experiences.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Watch the Warriors last night?
Yeah, they didn't play that well, but got the win.
Well, it wasn't that hard with Leonard out for the Spurs, and Parker already gone for the series.
And to add to that for San Antonio, David Lee got hurt during the game.
One more win and Golden State gets a rematch with Cleveland.
Boy, the Cavaliers have been unbelievable.
Yeah, even Kevin Love is playing great and Thompson on the boards.
And, of course there's always Lebron.
Well, the Warriors aren't to shabby either when you add in Kevin Durant.
He had a great game yesterday, and what about McGee--he's becoming a force.
Yeah, but he gets tired easily and I don't think he knows the defensive rotations that well.
But I think he's a lot better than Pachulia.
What about Pachulia and hurting Leonard's ankle--did you think it was a dirty play?
I don't, but everyone else thinks it was.  Look he's a clumsy guy and stumbled in.  I don't think he has the skill to make that play intentionally.
Yeah, he hurt his own player, Durant, by falling into him earlier in the year.
And no one mentions that Leonard was hurt already and then earlier in the game he sprained the ankle by landing on one of his own bench players.
Well, anyway, if things keep going as they are, it will be quite a series between the Cavaliers and the Warriors.
It looks like it--doesn't look as if Boston or San Antonio will win a game.
Well, I'll be rooting for the Warriors.
Me, too; I think they can do it if Klay Thompson gets going.

Did you see the Warriors Spurs game yesterday?
I did and it appears the Spurs are done.
Yeah, without Kahwi Leonard out the Spurs really have no chance down 3 games to zero.
True, but they still have two big man. Both Pau Gasol and LeMarcus Aldridge are playing poorly.
I think even with Leonard the Spurs would not win the series, but probably two games.
Hrad to tell. The Spurs have a lot of history. They have five world titles.
The problem is the Warriors are loaded. Brilliant shooters and great play making.
True, but they have a dirty player in Draymond Green.
I'm not sure how dirty Green is, but anyone would like him on their team.
Why is that? Because he is the heart and soul of the team. Can do anything, rebound and pass and score.
Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are superstars. They score are selfless and team players.
That is true. They are awfully talented and guys like JaVale McGee are having career years.
If and when the Dubs win this series how do you feel they will do against the Cavaliers?
It will be some series. Probably go seven games.
I agree with that. It is particularlly weird because both teams are likely to come into The Finals 12 and 0 which is record breaking.
Cleveland won last year. They showed more of a killer instinct with LeBron.
That is the problem. The Dubs are soft in my opinion. They are a finesse team not a lot of toughness.
What makes them soft? They have the best shooters in history
Because they are just that. Shooters. Only Green is tough, in the Finals the play gets rough and you have to be tough.
I agree, the Dubs may win this year but LeBron is a closer and may win it all.

Hey, did you see the Indians game last week?
Which game? They played more than once.
The one on Friday.
Oh, yeah. They played the Royals, right?
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I remember that one now. They lost.
Do you know what the score was?
I think it was 3-1.
Ouch. Was it a close game?
No, not really.
That's okay, we've still been doing fairly well this season.
Yeah, our offense is pretty solid.
True, but we are in a weak division.
Yeah. Do you think we'll be back in the playoffs this year?
I hope so.
We had a really good run last year.
We came so close to winning it all!
We sure did! Hey, hopefully this is the year.
With the Cavs championship win, I know Cleveland would love another.
For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Spurs beat the Rockets in game 6 the other night?
Are you kidding me? That was more like a beatdown and an embarassment.
Yeah! And the Spurs were the more injured team. They didn't have Leonard or Parker.
The Rockets should have taken game 6 easily, especially since they were at home.
No doubt. But James Harden pretty much quit on his team in my opinion.
Yeah. And the Rockets played with absolutely no effort. The whole team just quit.
Not the Spurs, though. They got pretty much all the rebounds and did all of the hustling.
Who is that guy who wears number 17 for the Spurs?
That is Jonathon Simmons. He had some monster slam dunks!
That man stepped up at the right time for Kawhi Leonard. The Spurs needed Simmons.
For sure. I hope Leonard will be back in time to play the Warriors. They'll need Leonard badly then.
Oh yeah! Because the Warriors are the best team in basketball right now. They haven't lost a playoff game this year!
Really? Who have they played so far?
First, they played the Trail Blazers, then the Jazz. And the Warriors swept them both!
I can see that, especially when you have Curry, Durant, and Green on the same team.
Don't forget Klay Thompson. He's just as good as the other three you mentioned.
And the Warriors have a great head coach in Steve Kerr. So do the Spurs, of course.
Yeah, and Gregg Popovich was Steve Kerr's coach many years ago when the Spurs won their first championship.
Wow! Has he been coaching that long?
Yes. For more than twenty years now, all with the Spurs.

Did you see game 2 between the Celtics and Cavs?
I did. It was a sad sight to behold.
What is going on with the Celtics?
I think that they were simply overmatched.
Lebron just did whatever he wanted to out there.
Yes. He gave them 30 points.
He also had 7 assists and only 1 turnover.
Kyrie also pitched in a respectable 23 points.
That is true. Kevin Love had 21 points as well.
Did you know the Celtics also had 20 turnovers.
I did and that is one of the main reasons they lost the game.
The Cavs also shut down the Celtics' star player.
Yes, Thomas only finished with only 2 points.
Wow, how can a team win when their star player plays so poorly.
The only way that can happen is everyone else has to pick up the scoring.
Well, that didn't happen for the Celtics.
That's right. Only 2 of the 5 starters scored in double figures.
As a plus for the Celtics, one of the bench players also scored in double figures.
The Celtics may have to make some line up changes if they want to increase their chances of winning.
Yes, I agree. I guess we will have to wait and see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite player from the 96 Chicago Bulls?
Scottie Pippen of course!
You don't like Jordan the best?
No, Scottie Pips all the way.
Remember the flu game?
Yeah that was great. Good thing Scottie P was there
What was Scottie Pippens number?
He was number 33.
I also liked Dennis Rodman
Yeah, he was good too.
Remember how Jordan could dunk from the free throw line?
Yes, but I still liked Scottie Pippen's sportsmanship better.
I think when Jordan decided to play baseball it was because he got caught betting on games.
I believe that conspiracy theory as well.
How come basketball players are allowed to travel in the pros?
I don't know. It's interesting.
Did you see the celtics play the bulls in the playoffs?
I did watch some of the games.
I'm sad the Bulls lost
Me too, friend. Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You watching the NBA draft tonight?
Yeah, gonna watch it at the bar, you wanna come?
Nah my wifes excited to watch it with me
Youre so lucky your wife loves sports, living the dream.
The Clippers don't have a first rounder this year, but I heard theyre trying to trade into the draft.
Enough with the Clippers...I think the Bulls pick 18th overall, so should be something good.
I always thought theyd trade out of their pick to try to help themselves at point guard...they need experience not youth at this point.
Maybe, we'll just have to see what happens.
One of my favorite parts of draft night is how often the crowd boos the commissioner...its kind of ridiculous.
I know I love it...right of passage through hatred haha.
Who do you think the Wolves and the Mavericks will take?
I dunno...who finished their freshman year at Kentucky this year? haha
Hahaha..or Duke...becoming the same thing with them...
Its crazy how good players are so early now....I think players at 16 are more NBA ready than 20 years old nowadays.
I know, when we were kids it was serious but nowhere near the level it is today..was all heart now its all wingspan
I played with a lot of heart...I didnt even make the highschool JV team.
Haha yeah but you are 5'7"
Don't rub it in
Anyways I gotta get going, good luck to your Bulls.
Haha have fun with your wife...and I guess good luck to the Clippers *groans*.... I guess...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Sixers ever be good again?
Depends on what they do this year
In free agency?
Combination of both
I mean Okafor, Saric, Embiid, Simmons, and a draft pick?
That seems like it could be an all star lineup
I just dont see where Okafor fits in
Either does Colangelo
You think they trade him?
Yes  and for pennies on the dollar.
He doesnt have that much worth anyway
Sure he does, they dont know how to use him.
Thats crazy, I thought he was a good player at Duke.
Hasnt translated to the NBA yet
But still the talent is there.
Well Boston would probably be best for him.
Is he a role player?
I think maybe, but right now I would still see if you can get 35 minutes out of him
Lofty goals for a guy who cant stay healthy
Well the Sixers have a terrible medical staff
XXXXXXXXXXX
Excited for Game 7 on Monday?
Yeah I am I just dont know why it cant be Sunday
I agree, bigger audience.
That and they need to do every other day.
These playoffs do seem to drag.
If you think about it, its almost half the season long!
Well who do you think is going to win?
I will say Boston.
Yeah me too, its crazy to think how it got to a game 7.
Well Thomas has played really well but Wall has as well.
I think Cleveland is just resting and gonna sweep whomever makes it next.
That could be true but the opposite could happen.
LeBron is too good to have stagnancy set in.
He is, him in the Finals is getting ridiculous.
Still not on MJs level though.
He will never be, its time to stop debating.
We just dismiss Kobe too.
Well he never had a run of dominance like that.
He had the supporting staff to do it.
Yeah he might be the best we never talk about. Just always James or Jordan
XXXXXXXXXXX
i wonder what the worst traveling violation is, then
Define worst.
The longest travel.
I think you mean the most steps took. It's more common nowadays because the NBA changed the rules. They allow traveling as long as it results ina cool play
Ok fine, then whatever. What's the most number of steps taken during a play that should've been called traveling.
Um the most I've seen is 7 with Carmello.Anthony.
What happened with that?
It wasn't called. He just walked with the ball in his right hand for like 7 steps. And the end play wasn't all that cool either.
That's not fair that they're not consistent with play calls.
Well, it is pretty cool when they do break away and go down the court to make a nice play.
Like what?
Like Corey Brewer. He takes the ball away and travels clear across the court, and about mid court, he takes the ball and proceeds to dunk
Did he make it?
Yep
and he was traveling?
Really really badly. He was practically carrying the ball for half the court almost.
See, that's not fair if you ask me
Well, the play was cool. It was his ball. He took it away.
But that doesn't mean we should allow players to break the rules.
Often dribbling causes players to lose the ball. At least this exception rule, we get to see cool plays and they still count towards the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the regular season end?
I believe April 12th.
Would you take Jordan or Russell?
In todays game, Jordan...40 years ago Russell.
Did you have fun at all-star weekend?
Oh yeah, New Orleans should host it every year.
When is the draft?
June 22, 2017
Do you think the Lakers will ever pass the Celtics with the most titles?
Yes and no, currently no- but if LA can put a great team together again like they did with Kobe and Shaq, they have a chance.
Do you think Lebron will eventually pass Abdul-Jabbar?
Oh yeah, you figure he can hang around for another 8-10 years. He will pass him easily.
What do you think are two things that SHOULD be considered when picking the MVP?
Individual excellence, a simple “best player.” And Most impactful.
Do you think team success should play a bigger part?
Definitely, without it then the season doesn't mean anything. Put Lebron on the Knicks and he will average 50+ points a game.
What is the "system" in Cleveland compared to the Spurs.
Lebron IS the system in Cleveland.
Should WHO their teammates are play a part?
Yes and no, this goes back to the arguement of a great player on a bad team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the game?
Which game? The rockets and the spurs?
Yeah, the spurs won in overtime! And James Hardens final shot got blocked.
Wow I missed it! So Harden missed a three point shot?
Yes! Genobly blocked it and the Rockets were not able to score again.
Oh the deception. The Rockets are my favorite team!
Ew I hate James Harden, he is so cocky and he is not an mvp.
Who is your favorite player, then if you don't think that James Harden is an MVP?
Klay Thompson #11, duh! He is so cute I call him my boyfriend.
Wow that is so neat, I met him once before in Oakland at a fundraiser.
NO WAY! Why am I just now hearing about this? Who else was there?
Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Ian Clark and Javale Mcgee! Half of the Warriors team.
What was the fundraiser for? How is the Warriors score right now?
The fundraiser was for children with cancer all proceeds went to St. Judges hospital. The Warriors are doing great!
Basketball is such an exciting sport watching the players go back and forth with the clock counting down.
Do you go to live basketball games ever?
Sometimes, once I got to view an NCAA tournament live!
I bet that was exciting! How many rebounds? What was the winning score?
98-40! There were 16 rebounds throughout the game.
It was great catching up with you, maybe we can catch a game together sometime?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Wizards game last night?
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cavs put the nail in the coffin on the regular season.
Spurs and the Heat both did this before the Cavs.
Yeah but Cavs look like they will sweep their way to the finals. All of the regular season indicators had them struggling somewhat to make the finals.
Lebron is large part of that since the teams success mostly hinges on how he plays. But 99% of teams cannot do this or have this approach.
I guess so but they were terrible defensively and simply didn't care. They had everyone convinced they had legitimate issues.
I was never convinced of anything. I have been saying for quite sometime call me worried if they are doing this in the playoffs.
You can only say this when the outcome is positive.
I disagree. Nothing happened in the regular season to lead me to believe the Cavaliers couldn't handle the Raptors, Celtics, and Pacers.
The Cavs have played the Celtics, Raptors, Pacers. With LeBron in the lineup, we were 9-1 against these teams in the regular season.
The problem is beating those teams, proves very little for the exact reason that their ill-equipped to stop what the Cavaliers do.
Defense is not something you can turn a switch on. If Cleveland could defend better they would out of pride than to finish in the bottom quarter.
Actually it kind of is. This is why playoff defense is always improved.
The problem is, teams with more talent, tend to have worse execution during the season, so when the playoffs come, they seem to turn it up a notch when in reality, they are just focused.
The Cavs don't have to play great defense to blow out opponents....even average defense will suffice given how easy they put up points.
What Cleveland is doing now is impressive, but firstly it is not the norm.
It is though! They are a completely unique team because of Lebron.
You just proved my entire point. Without Lebron, the Cavs wouldn't be where they are today.
Lebron's effort and will is the "switch," and the rest of the team takes their cue from him. Basketball is a team sport.
What are you going to say if the Cavs end up choking?
Lmao get a grip on yourself. Hell will freeze over before that happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It looks like it's going to be Boston and Cleveland in the Eastern Conference Finals.
Probably but Washington isn't dead yet. They can still force a game 7.
Yeah, but if they do game 7 will be in Boston.
It doesn't matter. Cleveland is still going to the finals.
Cleveland is going to have a lot of rest waiting around for the Celtics to finish their series.
So will Golden State waiting around for the Spurs or Rockets.
So the question is if Cleveland can repeat as champs.
It will be a great finals, but I don't think so.
Because of Durant?
Yeah, adding him to the Warriors is just too much.
Last year was an upset, but not this year.
Unless Mike Brown screws things up.
It's crazy that he used to coach the Cavaliers but now can beat them in the finals.
Yeah, especially since he came up short when he was with the Cavs.
Something tells me that LeBron is going to have to work really hard to win this one.
He's going to have to put the team on his back again.
He'll try but I think he's going to wear out this time.
He's going to have to slow down at some point.
We'll I'm not a big fan of either team so I just want it to be interesting.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok then how much money do the D league players make?
Well consiering NBA players are some of the best payed athletes in the world, in comparison it won;t seem much
How much? On the average?
Well, they range. From something like 25000 to 13000
That's not much at all.
No. It's a barely a life sustaining wage considering the amount of food they have to eat to stay healthy.
Why do they do it? It's amazing.
Again, for the chance. If they perform well, they might make it to the big league. It's their dream.
That's a big gamble.
Not really considering many read at a 5th grader's level.
Get out... no way, they went to college?
No, for real. They focus on playing the sports from middle school and on. And their academic development gets stalled and schools don't really do anythign about it
That's just plain wrong.
So you see why they're willing to get paid 13000 for a dream of being able to play in the big league.
Yeah...
See for me that's what's sad to me. Not that they're rejected and then still holding on to their dreams. But rather, they think they don't have much other options.
Oh my god stop. You're gonna make me cry.
Well if they make it, it's all good and well, but many of them don't. And what do you think they're capable of doing? Their communications degree won't get them a job in a corporate world.
I wonder what happens to those who don't get picked in the D leagues. What do they do after a couple of years?
Some get jobs, doing things unrelated to Basketball, others get basketball coaching jobs, and high schools, community colleges, universities. etc.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe the Wizards lost in the playoffs against the Celtics.
I can believe it.
Why do you say that?
Any team with Isaiah Thomas is a threat.  He is amazing
He is definitely a good player.  A very hardworker.
If you combine his talent with the talent that the Celtics have on the bench, you get a great team.
Agreed.  I just thought John Wall would be able to do enough to take out the Celtics.
The Wizards problem is that they don't have the deep bench that the Celtics have.
You don't think the Wizards have a deep bench?
No, I don't.  The Celtics bench outscored the Wizards bench throughout their playoffs.
Hopefully, the Wizards can pick up a few guys in the offseason to help John Wall.
Yep.  Isaiah Thomas has plenty of help on the court.
It is too bad Isaiah Thomas got injured.
He got injured??? What happened?
He has a hip injury.
Will he play against the Cavaliers?
No.  He may be done for the season.
Well, that is disappointing for him.  It is also disappointing for me as a fan.
Yes.  We will see have to see how they perform against the Cavaliers without Isaiah.
Maybe they have enough talented to get them past the Cavaliers.  It will be a challenge.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello Justin did you watch the game yesterday?
Are you talking about the basketball game last night?
Yes.
Yeah, it was really good.
I like how Steph Curry hit that 3 pointer at the buzzer.
Yeah but just wait until next game we are going to win .
Golden state has the number 1 position and the team really has handles
But my team with Kevin Garnet plays defense really well.
I think we're going to win it all.
Think what you wish.
Seriously i think you guys will loose just like years ago.
Wait, who won the champioship last year? I believe it was the warriors
Yes but we got this one this year
Are you bush tomorrow
No.
Maybe we can play one on one before the basketball game
ok cool
hit me up if you can .
Ok bring your baskeball
ok
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who wins Rookie of the Year?
A Sixer
No kidding? Which one?
I think Saric should
Because he stayed healthy?
Yeah the best ability is availability.
I believe that but Embiid was all worldly.
He was and he changed the way games looked.
So you wont give him the award?
He did not do it for long enough in my opinion
I guess I can see that viewpoint
Can Embiid stay healhy?
I would say no because of his height.
Shaq didnt have the problems hes having.
Of course not but thats rare.
So every year something else will happen.
I think so, yeah.
Is he teetering on Oden status?
Hes shown hes better than Oden.
I second that for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Howabout that Lebron!
I know right!
He has been in the league 14 years!
That is a long time.
How many rings does he have?
I think he has three.
Can you believe that Golden State blew a 3-1 lead?
No!
That was all Lebron.
Yes it was.
He willed his team to win.
For real...he was not to be denied.
He did really well in Miami.
Yes he did.
He got to Championchips there.
Yes..and then the one last year in Cleveland.
People were made when he first left Cleveland.
I would be also!
I will tell you though..to come back and win it all has to be one of the best "hometown sports stories" ever!
He is not done yet!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lebron...JAMES
yeah man, he really turns it on in the playoffs
it's crazy to think that he's actually still playing at his peak
he does have a lot of miles on his tires
2 whole seasons of playoff basketball!
but he still keeps a little in reserve
I hope he gets to smash boston in the eastern conference finals
he will, too
then....yikes
yeah, the warriors look unstoppable
we'll see, Lebron showed last year he has another gear when it matters
and nobody on golden state, or hell, nobody ALIVE has that gear
it's fun to watch
especially when the raptors went out of their way to be disrespectful
what were they thinking?
I don't know, but they got their butts whooped for it
sure did, I was laughing at Drake
yeah, he was salty
was that a "drake cries a lot" reference?
sure was, good catch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get home from work in time to catch the Golden State Warriors at the San Antonio Spurs game last night?
Almost, I missed the first quarter but I was able to catch the rest. What a game!
It sure was! It was pretty close the whole time.
Yeah, the Spurs struggled a little bit in the 2nd and 3rd quarters it looked like. Cost them the game in the long run.
I know. I was kind of rooting for them to pull through.
Me too! I'm usually a Dallas Mavericks fan, but I'll root for the Spurs, too.
They're playing again tomorrow night, do you think the Spurs can pull it off?
I don't know man, I sure hope so!
Me too, I think it will be tough though. Predictions are favoring the Warriors to win the series in 5 games.
You're right, it's gonna be a tough one. Even if they win, it will be pretty hard to come back and win 4 in a row.
Yeah, the Warriors are up 3-0 in the series, aren't they?
They are. They're a tough team to beat!
Durant and Curry are pretty unstoppable!
You got that right!
I just don't think the Spurs are going to pull it off, I hate to say.
Yeah, sadly I've got to agree with you. I think the Warriors are going to sweep it Monday night.
Me too. At least the Spurs still have home court advantage tomorrow.
True. Didn't help them last night though!
You're right, I guess we'll see! Want to come watch it my place?
Sure, sounds great! I'll see you there. Go Spurs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So it does seem like we will get the Warriors and Cavaliers in the Finals again.
Yes.  This would be three straight years.
Which team do you think is the favorite?
Honestly, it's really hard to say.  I mean everyone is leaning towards the Warriors.
That is true.  But how can you really bet against LeBron James, especially after last year?
Yes.  And I think there is an argument that the Cavaliers are a deeper team than the Warriors.
I agree.  I think the Cavaliers quietly did a good job upgrading their roster this season.
Yes.  Everyone talks about the Warriors adding Durant, but the Cavaliers added a number of good players.
I think the addition of Kyle Korver is a huge advantage for the Cavaliers.
Yes.  They are able to surround LeBron or Irving with shooters at all times.
Exactly.  Very good shooters at that.
And Deron Williams playing the point guard position off the bench is a huge benefit for them as well.
Well we are discussing the Cavaliers right now, but what about the Warriors?
Well to be fair, the Warriors would probably have won last season if Draymond Green had not gotten suspended.
That is true.  They were up three games to one.
Yes.  But I think even with the addition of Kevin Durant, this team overall might not be as good as last year's team.
Interesting.  They did win less games than last season.
Yes.  And I don't think their roster is as deep.
That is fair, but I still think the Warriors will win the Championship.
Yes, I'd agree.  I'm leaning that way as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the destruction of the Celtics the other night?
Unfortunately, I did. They need a whole new team to thwart LeBron!
Yes, and it isn't just Lebron, either. Kevin Love and Kyrie are both top 15 players!
Irving may even be top five himself.He is amazing.
Well, James went 7 for 7 in the 1st quarter in Game 1. He looked like a man against boys!
Yes, the Celtics are certainly overmatched.There is really nothing they can do!
They finally got lucky with the ping-pong balls in the draft.
It is a relief! Who are they going to take? Lorenzo Ball?
He is awesome, but I think they are leaning towards the kid from Washington.
Felt. He is a 6' 4" guard. How can he help?
His arms are really long.Although a streaky shooter, he can ball!
Okay, will that put them in the conversation?
Against Cleveland?, ..no way! But he is a good piece. Crowder should be traded.I see his limitations.
They ALL have limits. They are an excellent team already.It is just that James may be the Greatest of all Time. What can you do?
I guess we can reminisce. Larry Bird, DJ< McHale and Parish! Now, that was a team.
They might not be able to beat this Cleveland team!
Sorry, I have to disagree. The Celtics were 10 deep! This Cleveland team is not like that!
Maybe you are right! It is an answer we will never have.
Just enjoy the Celts for what they are. A team that can improve, too!
Gordon Hayward....would you come and play for the Celtics?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Durant moving to Golden State?
I'm pretty sure he just wants a ring and this is his easiest path to get one.
Yeah. I agree.
I'm also not sure how well he'll integrate into their system.
He's a big that they needed though.
That's true, their size is a detriment at times.
Especially against LeBron.
Ohh, that stings; 3-1.
I'm not sure how they'll ever get over that.
It's going to be tough.
Going 73-9 doesn't mean a thing if you ain't got that ring.
Yeah, still impressive what they did last year though.
I don't think I've won 73 anything in my life.
Me neither.
Who did Cleveland lose though?
Deli, but that's about it.
Man, that team is stacked too.
It's really a two race team this season.
So much for parity in the NBA.
Yup, crazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, I wish the Rockets could pull out this series.
There still is a chance.
Yeah I guess it is not totally over.
It is not, but Harden is looking really run down.
Exactly, that is the problem with not closing out series earlier.
Well that and him clearly being on an MVP campaign this year.
Yeah he just looks exhausted out there.
It is odd though since his teammates are not that bad.
They are not but the way they run their offense he has to be involved in each play.
That is true, his usage rate is off the charts.
Second only to Westbrook.
Who was rigging the system to get triple doubles.
Exactly! Which was the NBA's most overrated storyline this year.
Could not agree more.  Triple-Doubles are a totally made up stat.
Agreed.  I don't know why people clung to that so quickly.
Because ESPN repeated it a million times this year and made it seem like a thing.
Yeah, but really it was just ball hogging and terrible basketball.
Yeah, hero ball is not fun to watch.
Unless it is Jordan.
Yeah and Westbrook is no Jordan.

Will the NBA opt out of their deal with ESPN?
They dont care if people arent watching, as long as they keep getting the money deal.
Yeah but dont they want to grow the product?
I think the NBA is getting a good amount of viewership. They dont need to switch networks.
Will one of the other channels bid do you think?
I could see FS1 making a play for weekend games or something.
What about NBCSN?
No they have hockey and thats it.
Yeah dont they want to expand?
I dont think they are as focused on that.
Why do you say that?
They make money off of cable TV and internet, this is more of a retail thing they just need to do.
That sound stupid, look at how much money football brings in.
Yeah but basketball wont be able to get to that level
I dont agree with that, its definitely possible.
Not with how quickly teams go up and down
Thats not true every league has teams that go on runs
I just dont see your viewpoint thats all.
I think in 10 years we will see sports as dominant again and the NBA will be part of that.
Not saying much thats a guarantee
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what about the Warriors this year?
What do you mean?
Do you think the Warriors will win the Championship?
No way.
Why is that?
Because they don't play well.
But they have so many stars.
Name one.
Stephen Curry is a star player.
But he is too short.
But he is still effective in scoring points.
How many points does he usually score?
I'm not sure, around 30 per game.
That is a lot of points.
Ya, and he is not the only star.
Wow, so I think the Warriors are good.
Do you think they will win the Championship?
Ya I think they will.
Do you like their jersey colors?
Ya their colors are good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game  between the Cavs and Celtics.
Yeah, it was a blowout.
The Cavs were winning by 41 points at halftime.
I didn't even watch the second half.
Lebron was doing pretty much anything he wanted.
Isaiah Thomas was having a terrible game. Did you see he is going to muss the rest oif the playoffs?
Yeah, now the Celtics have even less of a chance than they did before.
I think the Cavs are favored by about 15 points in game 4.
I think they should be favored by way more than that.
Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving have been playing extremely well too.
I'm guessing we can get ready for a Golden State versus Cleveland finals again.
I would say there is no doubt about that.
Draymond Green is probably my least favorite player in the history of the NBA.
Everybody thinks Golden State is going to win it, but I'm not so sure.
Cleveland obviously has a very good team, and they did win the championship last year.
I think Golden State might be a little too overconfident. Kyrie had his way with Curry last year.
Klay Thompson couldn't guard him either.
Cleveland does have a better bench this year too.
Well here's hoping Cleveland repeats again.
People would then have to admit that Lebron just might be the best NBA player of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the Spurs biggest star in this next series?
I would say it all rests on Kahwi Leonard.
Yeah he seems to carry them alot.
They need him to be great.
Ginobli has become a part time player.
Well hes old, it happens.
They just seem to keep the rock going.
Pop makes sure his players believe in his system.
Do you think they ever dip again?
Sure, when he retires.
Dont his assistants carry on his teachings?
Well Brett Brown hasnt seen much success so far.
He hasnt even been given a legit roster yet.
Yeah but you dont see much progress.
I doubt Pop would ever lose 60 games in a season.
Well they intentionally lost for a lot of Brown's years.
They did have a legit roster in the beginning of the year and they stumbled out the gate.
Alot of those players were playing in the NBA for the first time.
But you want to see some level of competency.
Lets wait til this year and judge that book.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch the Cavs game tonight?
Of course I am! You?
No, I can't stand to watch LeBron.
Yeah, his complete and utter dominance of his opponents must be intimidating to watch for a Warriors fan like yourself.
Something like that...you know the Warriors will crush the Cavs in the playoffs!
Just like they did last year?
Ok, but the Warriors have Durant now.
Yeah, and the Warriors only picked him up to get him out of their way....
I'm not going to argue with you there.
It'll be a good match, unlike the Eastern finals right now.
Yeah, the Celtics are getting embarrassed.
I'm glad. I've hated the Celtics ever since Olynyk ripped Love's arm out of his shoulder in 2015.
You know he didn't do that on purpose!
You would say that...you probably defend Draymond Green kicking all these guys, too. I'm sure that's always an "accident."
Hey, if Green were on your team, you'd like him.
Not true. His body fat percentage is way too high for an NBA player, and he just plays dirty. I don't appreciate his style of play in the slightest.
Well, in any case, I'm looking forward to watching another Cavs/Warriors finals.
I am too. Hopefully the Cavs don't have to come from behind like last year.
Hopefully you don't get a chance to, because the Warriors will sweep the Cavs!
Yeah, yeah...go Cavs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you enjoying the NBA playoffs so far?
Not really, there have not been enough competitive games.
I agree, hopefully the finals makes up for it.
I sure hope so, LeBron and the warriors are playing so well.
It could be a very historic match up.
Are you a fan of either team?
No, my team didn't even make the playoffs.
Same here, I do really like Stephen Curry though.
Me too, I liked him all the way back when he was in college.
Are you looking forward to the draft?
Absolutely, it is one of my favorite events of the year.
I really like Lonzo Ball despite his dad.
I'm more a fan of the players from Kentucky as I root for them in college.
Lonzo sure struggled against them in the tournament.
He certainly did. I think Fox will be a better pro than him too.
Do you play basketball as well as watching it?
I do, I live by a park and play multiple times a week.
That's awesome, I haven't played in too long.
You should really get back out there, its too much fun not to.
Maybe I'll go and try to find a pick up game later this week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Cavaliers dismantle the Raptors last night?
I sure did. Toronto never even had a chance.
I was surprised it was a sweep, but I knew the Cavs would beat Toronto. The Cavs have the King.
Everybody knew the Cavs would beat Toronto. Do you think the Celtics can beat the Wizards?
No. Isiah Thomas doesn't have enough help. When he can't score, neither can the Celtics, and the Wizards are stopping him from scoring.
Do you expect the Wizards can challenge the Cavaliers?
No. At best, the Wizards might be able to win one game against the Cavaliers. I think the Cavaliers will have the two best players on the floor.
You really think Kyrie is better than John Wall?
Yes, I do. I expect the Cavs to beat the Wizards in four or five games. It would be a minor miracle if it went to six games.
So then, you think that no one can beat Lebron and the Cavs?
I didn't say that. No one in the East can beat them though.
Who are the teams out West that you think can beat them?
I expect that the Spurs can give them a run for their money. Although I don't think the Spurs will win the West due to Tony Parker's injury. They are always competitive, though.
Yes. And while there's no defensive player who can stop Lebron, Kawhi Leonard comes closest.
I agree with that, but he doesn't have enough help. I expect that either the Rockets or the Warriors will come out of the West. The Cavs would beat the Rockets though, I think.
So, you're saying that the Cavs are going to win this year unless the Warriors do?
Not quite. If by some miracle, San Antonio comes out of the West, they can beat the Cavs. I don't expect them to win the West, though. The Rockets can't beat the Cavs. The Warriors can.
Do you really think the Warriors-Cavs series will be different from last year if they meet again?
Well, first the Warriors were only one made three away from beating the Cavs. Second, the refs allowed Steph Curry to be fouled all through four games straight last year. I hope that doesn't happen again. I think the Warriors were better last year. I think they're better this year. I expect they can win.
Maybe you are right, but I wouldn't wan to bet against Lebron James.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Trailblazers have a bright future ahead of them
Yeah I believe this organization is going in the right direction
I mean that backcourt is already one of the best in the league
Mccullom and Damian Lilliard are almost unstoppable.
I love watching both of these guys play
Especially when they are both in a groove at the same time.
Now that they have their center of the future, it's going to be interesting.
I just hate that Nurkic got hurt before the playoffs.
Me too. I would have loved to see what he could have done against the Warriors
For sure. But they will definitely be a fun team to watch next year
Indeed. The western conference is so competitive it's still going to be hard for them to improve
Yeah I mean everyone in the West seems to get better every year.
With that being said if they can play better on defense this team could leapfrog some others
Right. They were one of the hottest teams down the stretch last year.
For sure. They are a tough team to play at their house
I love the energy of that crowd. Something about those fans really pumps me up
They do have a great crowd and arena.
Yeah that place is always rocking
Maybe they can get it back to the Clyde Drexler Portland days.
Wouldn't that be phenomenal!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite basketball team?
I like the Pittsburgh Pirates
No that's not a basketball team!
I like the New York Rockets?
That team doesn't exist. The Rockets are in Houston.
You're in Houston.
Okay, back to seriousness. Have you ever been to a basketball game?
Yeah. I went to the U of Pitt basketball game once?
Nice. Did you know what was happening.
Yeah. I'm a sports guy.
So, what do you like about basketball?
I like when they kick the ball through the yellow posts.
No! You're confused again. That's not basketball.
You're not basketball.
You're acting like a child. I'm just asking you about basketball.
Okay. My favorite thing about basketball is when the crowd cheers very loudly.
There you go! That's something relevant.
Yeah, I also like it when the fourth quarter is close.
Close games are fun. We should watch a game sometime.
Sure bro.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Celtics use that draft pick this year?
No I think they need to trade it.
They could use Fultz.
They may be able to but I dont think they need it to be good.
So what do they do with it?
I would package it for a proven star right now.
Like Jimmy Butler?
Maybe thats where they go.
But wont this help them by getting younger.
They are plenty young.
Plus they have the Nets pick next year.
Yeah so this is looking like its going to work out for everyone.
What if they dont trade it.
Then theyll have a surge in certain areas relative to the picks.
Oh OK, do they resign Thomas?
Depends on the person they draft.
I would keep him, he looks like a stud.
Yeah but he might price himself out of their range
I dont believe there is a price too high.
Yea he seems like he may be their core.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you following the NBA playoffs this year?
Yeah, I've caught several of the Spurs vs. Warriors games.
Ooh, I hope you're not a Spurs fan.
I mean, I was, until these last three games.
Just a fair weather fan?
When you're getting beat that badly, yeah.
To be fair, y'all had a lot of injuries this season.
Oh I have some choice words for Zaza.
Him taking out Kawhi in game 1 like that was pretty brutal.
Brutal? It was completely uncalled for and Zaza should be taken out.
Taken out of the game, I hope you mean. His family received death threats over it.
For real? Look, I'm mad at Zaza but don't take it out on his family.
Yeah. Him missing games two and three pretty much wrecked the Spurs chances.
Warriors would have to mess up pretty badly at this point, they utterly wrecked us in game three.
They looked pretty chill on the bench at the end there.
I mean, give us a break. They've got three of the top players in the conference, and we're down one.
Did you hear that Zaza's likely to be out for game four?
Seriously? We're definitely not winning any games then.
Yeah. I think they figured there were no chances of the Spurs winning the match up so they might as well not risk injuring him more.
That's fair I guess. Safety and health first, even if it means losing games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just refuse to get on the Seth Curry bandwagon.
Why is that?  He's putting up numbers like crazy since he's been with the Warriors.
He just isn't a good all around baskeball player.
What do you mean?
He doesn't actually play defense, he just stands there, waiting for one of his teammates to pass him the ball, so he can shoot.
Yeah, what's wrong with being able to shoot?
Nothing is wrong with it, and it's a great part of the basketball game, but there are so many other parts he doesn't even try to play!
Yeah, I can see that.  He is an amazing shooter though.  He's one of the best.
Hardly, I mean you're forgetting about the greats, man.
Who are the greats then?  Who is better?
Well, let's see, Reggie Miller, Steve Nash, Larry Bird, to name a few, and that's shooters who also played defense.
What do you mean, he isn't even the best in his own field of 3's?
No, he's mediocre, at best compared to the greats.  Sure he can hit a 3 from half court, but so could many many many others, who also found the time and energy to play defense.
I see what you're saying, he just isn't as good in his own environment?
Exactly, I mean he isn't even the best shooter of all time, let alone the best basketball player.
Yeah, did you see that ESPN interview where they were comparing him to a young Kobe or even the great Michael Jordan?
Yeah, that's what sent me on this rant.  It's like, you people are supposed to be professionals and to actually know your basketball history.
No, come on, you know they just get ex players to talk about those games, and those players are so biased it's unreal.
Exactly, it's just like they are all over his jock because he's relevant and popular now, not even considering the history of basketball.
I get what you're saying, he really is overrated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you thin Cleveland or Golden State will lose a game before the NBA Finals?
I think San Antonio will take a game from Golden State if Kawhi Leonard returns healthy.
Is Lebron James the G.O.A.T.?
I think so because the bulls were still a great team without Michael and if they had added another superstar when he left, they could've won the championship.
You're crazy Noone could stop MJ.
Lebron is the best and makes his teammates better.
So you think they will beat Golden State?
Heck yeah. Golden state is gonna get bullied all over the court.
Cmon, man. How are they gonna stop KD and Steph?
Steph Curry is the weakest link. He has no defense and they are gonna treat him like a baby.
You see all the open shots Boston had? Do you think Golden State will miss those shots?
There are too many mismatch and they are gonna be so tired after trying to hold defense on Cleveland.
How much you want to bet?
Anything because Lebron is the man. He's unstoppable and when you try to double team him he's kicking it to Love and the only thing you are going to hear is swish.
The only swish I'll be hearing is the ones coming from the three's from KD Klay, Steph, Draymond, Livingston, Iggy. We got too many weapons.
We will see because their hands are going to be full trying to stop us. Draymond is the heart and soul of that team. KD ain't no Alpha Dog. Steph ai'nt no Alpha Dog. Your best players fall when the pressures on.
In the mean time, while we're waiting on that, come and get smashed on the 2k right now.
Ok, I'm gonna show you what the Cavs gonna do in the Finals.
If they get past Boston.
Really, you better be worried about a Leonard if he come back healthy. It'll be the second year in a row ya'll blow a lead.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the point guard for the Celtics play?
No what did I miss?
Man he is a super human.
Oh really is he big?
No, he looks like a small guy out there.
How tall is he.
He is listed at 6 foot 3.
Oh so he is probably 6 foot 1 then
Yes because they measure him in his high tops, and round up.
Wow so he looks small out there, but is kinda big in real life?
Yes that is correct.
What did he do in the game?
He moves so well.
Oh really?
Yes he must have the most perfect body in the world in my opinon.
Wow those NBA point guards are amazing.
Yes they show what the human body is capable of.
When do they play next.
They play tomorrow.
Ok thanks I will watch him play.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know anything about basketball?
Not really.
Would you like to learn some basics?
Sure.
Have you ever seen or handled a basketball?
Yes.  It's a large ball that bounces easily and can be held in one hand, if it's a big hand!
Right.  Have you seen a basketball court?
I have.  It's a large open floor with backboards and hoops on either end.  It's about half as wide as it is long.
Right.  Do you know the objective of the game?
I think so.  Points are scored when a player throws the ball through the hoop.  Who ever scores the most points before the clock runs out is the winner.
That's right.  Do you know how many players are allowed to play the game?
No.  But I do know that some are playing while others sit on the sidelines.
Yes, some are one the sidelines resting while 5, per team, are on the floor playing the game.  So a total of 10 players play the game.
I see.  Who are the people with the stripped shirts who are on the floor?
They are the referees.  They watch the play to enforce the rules of the game.
So the game has rules?
Yes, a number of them that makes the game fair for each side.  Too many to go into detail now.
I see.  What are the names of the positions on the court?
A couple of positions include a point guard who shoots shots from the perimeter and a center who is the tallest person who shoots under the hoop.
I have alot to learn about this sport!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like basketball right?
Yes, I do a lot. Mostly pro ball.
Are you into the classic games?
Yeah, I like watching any with Wilt Chamberlein.Do you?
Yeah, he was a legend. I stick to old ones with Jordan for sure. Did you think he was the best?
No, I would have to go with Kareem Abdul Jaabar. He is a legend.
He was. Do you follow any teams now?
Yes, I follow the Atlanta Hawks.
There center is Dwight Howard right?
Yeah, he plays a good game. Do you follow any teams closely?
I follow the Hawks too. I also follow the Lakers close, Their point guard is really great.
Jordan Clarkson? HE scored high points in a game I seen in person.
Have you seen a lot of NBA games in person?
I have seen a few. I like the international ones.
I was not aware of those.
Yeah, they do them sometimes for charity,go to another country and play. It is really cool.
I would like to see basketball in another country.
It was worth the price. Did you catch the last Hawks game?
No, I did not get a chance. Was it tense?
Oh yeah, they always are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Cavalier game the other night?
Yes! Pure fire.
Lebron was killing it.
I know, did you see how he was moving up and down that court.
Yes! it was like he was on the court playing an amateur team.
I know, the Celtics got schooled.
You know man, I used to be a huge Celtics fan.
I know they used to be good.
It's like they have lost their mojo.
Its either that or Cleavland is just that good.
You mean Lebron is just that good.
Nah, you got Irving and Love.
Yeah, yeah..I know.
You also got Shumpert. He's good as well.
But, that Lebron is a beast.
Yes, he is he made Boston look like school yard boys.
Poor Isaiah Thomas, trying his hardest to keep up.
The whole game was funny, 44 points, you kidding me.
I can't wait until game 2.
It's gonna be awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch the Boston vs. Cleveland game tonight?
Yea, I wanted to. What time is it on?
It's at 8:30pm EST.
Ok, cool. Who do you think will win?
I think Cleveland will, now that Isaiah Thomas is out.
Yea, and the way they lost in Game 2 was so bad.
Yes, and I feel like Lebron James is in the zone.
Even when they are up he is still looking ahead and trying to do better.
I agree, I wonder who will start for Boston?
I don't know but I don't think it will matter.
True, I guess we'll see tonight!
Can't wait! When's the next game?
Golden State plays San Antonio on Monday.
I wish they would skip to the finals already. It's going to be a great series.
So you think Cleveland and Golden State?
Yea, it's pretty much guaranteed.
How did Lebron finish fourth in the MVP race?
They get enamored with statistics.
Yea but there's more to it than just triple doubles.
We're seeing it play out in the playoffs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the 76ers will draft in the upcoming NBA Draft?
They have the toughest pick at #3. There's no clear-cut choice with that pick.
Yeah, it's not like the first and second pick.
This is a two-player draft. Then after that, it's up in the air with 6 really good players.
They have to address their needs rather than taking the best player available, which I think is Tatum.
I agree. They have too many big men as it is. Taking another forward or center is redundant.
So who should they take? A point guard?
They need shooting. They should take the best shooter available, which is Malik Monk.
Even if there are 5 players that are better than him.
Yes, because the five players better than him aren't strong shooters or play positions they don't need.
It's a shame they didn't get one of the top two picks. Those guys would be perfect for their team.
What's ironic is the teams that did get the top two picks don't really need those players on their roster.
The Celtics and Lakers both need big men in a draft that's top heavy with point guards.
Fultz and Ball are both upgrades over who they have now, but I don't see either team being better the next year.
They'll both be better in the long run, which is what the draft is really about.
I wish there was a way the Celtics could find a player that makes them both better next year AND better in the long run.
They would have to pass up on Fultz and take someone like Tatum, but that's a poor choice in the long run.
Do you think they would trade the pick for the chance to get a lot better next season?
They would need to get a very young player in return who is on a long contract to ensure he stays with the Celtics for at least 3 years.
Even then, I don't think it's a good move. Fultz is the best prospect to come around in the last five years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Afternoon.
Hello.
Doing okay?
Yep, you?
Yeah not bad.
Good.  We're supposed to talk about basketball?
Yeah, you a fan?
Yeah I like basketball.
Ever play?
Yeah I played a little rec league when I was a kid. You?
I played in high school.
Oh cool.  were you good?
Yeah I was okay.
Cool.  I wasn't very good.
Don't sell yourself short.
No man, I was bad lol.
Did you play any other sports?
No not really.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is going to win between the warriors and the spurs?
I think the Warriors will win.
Why?
The warriors have too many weapons.
I agree with that.
Although, the spurs do have the best coach.
Do you think kerr will coach?
I am not sure. I heard he was at practice the other day.
That is a good sign. I think they need him.
I don't think they need him need him, but he would help.
Who will be the key to the series?
I think Steph.
Why?
His shooting makes the defense have to spread too much of the floor.
Yes, that is dangerous with the warriors ball movement.
Best passing team in the game.
Yes, they always seem to find the open man.
It is beautiful to watch.
You have got me excited about the game tonight.
Me too. I hope the warriors sweep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won game 6 between the Celtics and Wizards last night?
The Wizards did, but just barely, and only because John Wall made a game-winning three.
John Wall is a terrific player, one of my favorites to watch.
He could have been MVP if it weren't for James Harden and Russell Westbrook getting all those triple-doubles.
Which team do you think will win this series.
I don't know, because neither team seems to want it bad enough. Regardless, the Cavaliers will beat either team to get to the Finals.
So are you saying there will be a Warriors-Cavaliers rematch?
It could happen, but the Warriors have to go through the Spurs first, and the Spurs aren't easy to beat.
Do you think LeBron James is as good as Michael Jordan?
It's hard to say. I think time will tell.
I ask because Jordan has six championships, but LeBron only has half that amount.
True, but LeBron has some years of basketball still yet to play. He has time to win three more.
Right, but he'll probably have to hurry. The Cavaliers won't stay this good forever, unless they're the Spurs.
Yeah, because the Spurs are good every year, regardless of who plays for them. I don't know how they do it.
So, where will game 7 be played at?
It will be played in Boston, and, come to think of it, the Celtics will win just because of that.
I agree. The Wizards barely won at home, and they surely aren't going to survive a hostile environment like Boston.
Right. Plus there is too much green painted on that parquet basketball court.
Not only that, but Isaiah Thomas will step up at the right time, and so will his teammates.
I agree. This is Boston's best team since the big 3 of Garnett, Pierce, and Allen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's shot is it.
It's my shot.
Okay, here is the ball.
Thank you.  What's the score?
I have three, you have two.
I thought that I had three as well!
No, you missed your last shot.
Yeah, okay.  You have to take this shot with your eyes closed.
I can't believe you made that!
Remember, your eyes have to be closed.
There was no way I was going to make that.
It was a pretty good shot.
So now we are tied at 3?
Yes, we are tied.
Do you want to call it a game?
Yeah, that sounds good.
Can I have my basket ball back?
Sure, here it is.  Thanks for the game.
Yeah that was fun.
We'll play again soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I haven't doen any dribbling in forever.
I'm not good at it.
Neither am I apparently but we need to practice for this charity game.
Yes, I know. I don't know why I signed up, though, because I'm not the best basketball player on earth.
I think we're both pretty mediocre but they really needed teams.
It's for a good cause at least.
Yes, it is.
Are you any good at baskets at least?
Better than I am at dribbling.
Ryan's a really good player. He's on our team at least.
I don't even care who wins anyway.
Neither do I. I just want to earn money for the kids.
That's why I signed up.
Here, try it like this.
Hey, I just dribbled for a whole thirty seconds. That's pretty cool.
You're getting better.
Looks like you are too.
A bit.
This is a pretty good work out as well.
I agree. My muscles are telling me so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the NBA Playoffs?
Of course!  I always watch this time of the year.
Which series has been the most interesting to you so far?
Definitely the Spurs and the Rockets.  Competitive series, one of the few we've had this year.
Yes, that is true.  Which team are you rooting for there?
I would say the Rockets.
Why are you rooting for the Rockets?
Well I want to see competitive series.  I feel like if they beat the Spurs and play the Warriors, it will be a better series.
Wow, so you think the Rockets have a better chance of beating the Warriors than the Spurs?
Yes, I think so.
Why do you think that?
Well health is a big reason.  Spurs have some key injuries now.
That is true.  Tony Parker is done for the year.
Yes, and Kawhi Leonard got injured last game.  We don't know how he's going to look the rest of the way.
That is a good point.  Plus the Rockets simply have more firepower.
That is true.  I don't think they will beat the Warriors, but they should have a better chance than the Spurs.
Ultimately it looks like another Warriors and Cavaliers Finals, right?
Oh yea.  Barring some major injury, that's what we will get.
Who do you have in that one?
Warriors in seven games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Lakers and Celtics game last night?
Yeah! The Celts really stuck it to them!
I wonder what Kobe was thinking at the end of the game?
Probably something like "get me outta here, this is awful!"
Probably so! What do you think the chance is for the Celtics to go all the way this year?
I think if Pierce and Rondo stay healthy, there's a good chance.
I'll be keeping my fingers crossed. I'd love to see it.
Me too! We should totally have a watch party when the playoffs start.
Absolutely! We would have fun doing our own game analysis.
Definitely! I love looking at how teams call plays.
Who do you think is the best rebounder the Celtics have?
Probably Pierce, even though he's not a big guy.
What's the big goofy guy's name, who's always awkward handling the ball?
You know, I can't remember.
Hmm. Okay. What do you think about Lebron this year?
I think he's doing well, but he's a little overrated this time around.
Why do you say Lebron is overrated this year?
He just hasn't put up the scoring numbers.
Fair enough. Do you think he'll ever be considered as good as Michael Jordan?
No way! Michael Jordan will always be the greatest!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cavaliers are much better than the Celtics.
Yes, that is true.
Lebron is in his prime and Irving just makes them better.
Do not forget Kevin Love.
The Warriors are good too.
Yes they are. Durant is great.
Do not forget Curry.
Yeah, he's great too.
I wonder if Lebron will get a second straight title.
I think so. He is the best player.
What do you think of the Clippers?
They are unfortunate.
Yeah, I think they care more about clubs than they do basketball.
I think they might just play for the money.
Yeah, they always choke at the end.
Do you think Leonard will be back?
Yes, but not this year.
Do you think the Warriors will sweep the Spurs?
Definitely. The Spurs are too shorthanded.
Maybe next year for the Spurs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Suns are good?
They were with Nash
I agree. Once Gortat showed up, it all went bad.
Yeah and Scola and Beasley.
I miss the Nash days.
I miss the Barkley days.
I wish D'antoni would be their coach again.
I loved the run and gun offense.
The Suns always get the short end of the stick.
Yeah, we never get the top pick, or anything.
This year we got number 4.
Yeah and the Celtics and Lakers magically got the top 2.
I bet the draft is rigged.
Maybe, but I really hope the Suns get it together.
How do we do that?
Get rid of Bledsoe and Knight.
Yes and let Booker become the main guy.
I think we should fire Watson as coach too.
Who should be the coach?
Maybe Steve Nash is free?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't stand the league.
What about them?
The latest rule changes, right?
No?
Yeah.
I like them.
They're really good at ruining fast play.
I mean, they make the game complex.
They're not good rules.
They're absurdly good rules.
They're like absolute terror.
I love them, to be honest.
No way.
I mean, yeah.
Come on.
All the games were the same.
They were fast.
They were frustrating.
Colorful. Meaningful.
Pathetic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is going to win the NBA chip this year?
I think Golden State warriors
Who is the best player in the nba?
I think it is Steph
Do you think the rockets will be the spurts?
No, Rockets def win
What do you like about the Warriors?
The ball movement.
Do you play basketball?
Yes
Who is your team?
The spurs
Do you miss Duncan?
Yes, we def miss him
Who will win the East?
The Cavs
Who wiill win the West?
The Warriors
Do the Jazz have a chance?
no
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game 3 between the Warriors and the Spurs?
Yes. The Spurs didn't stand a chance without Kawhi Leonard.
I know but they still have Lamarcus Aldridge.
Yes, but he is not as good as Kawhi.
Aldridge did score 18 points in the game.
The problem with that is that he only had 5 rebounds so that is not going to cut it.
Danny Green and Patty Mills didn't shoot the ball well either.
Yes, both of those players shot well below 50%.
The Spurs also shot terrible from the 3 point line.
That's true. A team that plays against the Warriors and shoots that poorly is probably not going to win the game.
On the flip side, the Warriors got 33 points from their star player Durant.
Yep, Curry also pitched in a respectable 21 points.
Did you know Durant also had 10 rebounds?
I didn't but I did notice that the Warriors turned the ball over 21 times.
Yes, it was a strange game for them.
Yep, but it appears that it didn't matter because they hit over 50% of their shots.
Exactly, they still beat the Spurs by a respectable 12 points.
Yep, if the Spurs do not win the next game, their season is finished.
That is so true but what can they do with Kawhi Leonard.
I don't know but they better figure something out very quickly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the NBA playoffs?
Yes.  It's been a competitive playoffs
Do you think anybody can beat the Cavaliers in the East?
Probably not.  Lebron James is playing awesome.
What about the Warriors in the West?  Can anybody beat them?
Probably not.  I think we are going to see a Warriors vs Cavaliers rematch in the finals.
I agree.  Who wins?
I like the Warriors to win it all
They are stronger with the addition of Kevin Durant, but I like the Cavaliers to repeat.
No way.  The Warriors are playing at another level.
They live and die with the 3 point shot, just like last year.
Maybe so.  Unlike last year they have more weapons.
They do have more weapons, but they aren't playing as united as the Cavaliers
Player for player the Warriors are better.
No way,  I see it 3-2 Warriors at best.  I'll give you Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and Draymond Green
I see it 4-1.  The 1 being Lebron James.
That's big 1.  Best player in the world.
Basketball is a team game
Just like last year, Lebron James will elevate his team.
I guess we will see.  Care to make a friendly wager?
XXXXXXXXXXX
James Harden has disappointed me this playoffs.
I could see that.
I was hoping the Rockets would roll on to the Western Conference Finals behind him.
Yeah it would have been really fun to watch.
The problem is I think he finally got tired.
It sure looks that way.
I can't really blame him though.
Yeah his usage is through the roof.
Only Westbrook makes him look like he is underutilized.
Yeah and that man is a psycho.
Yeah a psycho I do not enjoy watching play.
Yeah his game is too him-centric for me.
Me too.
At least with Harden he is getting others involved.
Yeah his assist numbers don't even adequately show how much he helps that offense.
Yeah he is the spoon that stirs the drink for that team.
Yeah which is why I think it is disappointing that he isnt shining more.
Yeah plus everyone is ready to jump all over him when the team struggles.
Yeah hopefully they turn it around.
Yeah lets hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Looks like it's going to be the Warriors vs the Cavs in the finals
Yeah just like most people thought
I was really hoping for something different but oh well
Yeah me too. Who do you think wins it all?
I think the Warriors win in six games.
I say the Warriors win in seven games
I just think the Warriors have too much firepower
Yeah, especially with the addition of Kevin Durant to their lineup
Yeah that has made them even more potent
It just going to be hard to overcome all of that talent
Yeah I think the Warriors are just too good
In the end they will wear down Lebron James
Yeah I think Kevin Love needs to have a huge series in order for them to have a chance
I agree and their bench needs to play well also
That's the only way they have a shot at this
If Lebron pulls this off I think it puts him a little closer to Jordan
I believe that as well. This is a huge challenge to take on
Probably the biggest challenge that he has ever had
We are talking about beating a potentially all-time team
Yeah that would be an amazing accomplishment
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between Kentucky and North Carolina?
I did and North Carolina won.
Oh really. Who led North Carolina in scoring?
Justin Jackson scored 19 points.
Okay. Who was Kentucky's leading scoring?
Bam Adebayo and Deaaron Fox both scored 13 points.
Who had the most assists on Carolina's team?
Justin Jackson had 4 assists.
Who had the most assists for Kentucky?
Briscoe had 8 assists for Kentucky.
Who had the most rebounds for Carolina?
Meeks had an astounding 17 rebounds.
Wow, that is crazy.
I know, right. Kentucky could not keep him off the boards.
Which team had the most turnovers?
North Carolina had 16 turnovers.
What about field goal shooting?
Kentucky hit 42% of their shots while Carolina hit 47% of their shots.
So what was the final score?
Kentucky had 73 points while North Carolina had 75 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the Wizards become a team?
I'm not sure but I heard Michael Jordan owns them.
Did he play for them?
I'm not sure.
Where do the Wizards play?
I think in Washington.
Do you know what city?
No, I don't.
How come the Wizards came to be?
I am not sure.
Did Jordan play for the Wizards?
Ya for a season or two.
Was he old then?
Ya he was past his prime.
Did he play well.
Ya he still played well.
Did he dunk?
Ya he dunked.
Did he dribble a lot?
Of course he is Jordan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well the Finals are almost here, who ya got?
Golden State and it's not even close.
Not even close? You don't think LeBron can give them a series.
Cleveland might get a game or two but the trophy is moving back out west this year.
See I think it's a lot closer than you think.  Maybe even the Rockets can challenge Golden State.
The Rockets won't even make it past San Antonio.
That is really sad when a bunch of old guys can hang with the young guns.
Shows just how good of a coach Pop is.  Always gets the best out of his players.
I just think if Houston can get through, they have a chance of outscoring the Warriors.
A lot of teams have a chance, but they rarely do.
True, true.  Boston or Washington in the Eastern semis?
I think Boston will take it now. They looked impressive out there tonight and I don't see them losing at TD Garden.
I think so too, it will go 7 though for sure.
Yeah if Washington had home court advantage I'd lean their way.
Such a close series but none of the games have been particularly tight except Game 2.
Kind of crazy.  That's why neither has a chance against the Cavs.
I think there's more than one reason but I gotcha.
Should be interesting, we'll have to wait and see.
Yeah I'm looking forward to it.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see what the Boston Celtics wore before the game?
Yeah, wearing all black like going to a funeral
That was pretty messed up, even more since isaiah thomas' sister just passed away
Yeah I thought that was weird too.
I love how John wall buried the other team with that 3 pointer
Oh yeah me too, he definitely showed them up for wearing all black
I also loved how he responded about his city
yeah you don't go out and do that in another mans city
I am looking forward to game 7 though, who do you think will win?
Well with the way things are going i'd say celtics but I want the wizards to win
I agree, I prefer the wizards to the celtics, I think celtics have won enough already lol.
Yep, most championships ever is enough for a while I think
So who you got in the spurs vs warriors?
It's really hard to chose against the warriors, but I think that the spurs have a good chance.
Yeah I agree, especially with the size advantage the spurs have.
Yeah they defenitely have that, and also a better defensive team
True that, I just hope whoever gets through is tired when facing the cavs
So you dont think either wizards or celtics have a chance against the cavs?
No I don't see it going past 5 games
Bold prediction but the way the cavs are playing it's totally possible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was really upset at game 1.
Yeah I know. Leonard was having a great game.
I bet the Spurs would be winning the series if he played.
Yeah, it sucks when a bad player from the other team does something like that.
Bruce Bowen used to do it all the time.
Yeah, so it's funny that it would happen to Popovich.
At least Popovich gets to experience what the Suns did many years ago.
Yeah, we went through all of that.
Remember when Stoudemire was suspended for walking on the court?
Yes, that was terrible.
I like the Cavaliers chances.
Anybody but the Warriors.
I know. I can't stand the Warriors.
That Green guy has such an arrogant attitude and there's no sense in it.
Right, cause it's not like hockey where you will get punched for having an attitude like that.
I'd like to see the Spurs Celtics in the finals
That won't happen.
I think it would be funny if the top two teams lost.
Maybe next year the Suns will be good
No chance
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Cavaliers and Celtics game on Friday night?
For a while.  But it was so uncompetitive I eventually turned it off.
Me too.  I can't believe how one-sided it is.
I know Lebron is unstoppable and all, but the Celtics are supposed to be the number one team in the East and lost by almost 50 points at home!
Yeah, it's incredible.  And now with Isaiah Thomas out it could be even worse the rest of the way.
Please no!  Maybe they'll figure out a way to pull things together and make the next couple games interesting.
I hope so but wouldn't count on it.  You know uncertainty is the only certainty in sports but I think this has 4-0 sweep written all over it.
You're probably right.  It's the same thing with the Warriors and Spurs.
Yeah, the radio guys have been saying 'Why even play these other games?'  Just have the Warriors and Cavs play a best of 11 series or something.
Ha!  That would be good and what everyone really wants to see!
I really wish Kawhi Leonard hadn't gotten hurt.  They could have made it a series.
I agree, I don't know why everyone had the Spurs such a big underdog.
Well, it's not quite the same Spurs team from a few years ago.  But it's still the Spurs!
If Kawhi and Parker were both playing, it could have been really interesting.
Oh well!  What's your prediction for the Finals?
I think Cleveland wins in six.
Really?  I disagree.  This is a revenge year for the Warriors!
Maybe.  But Lebron is just too tough right now and Steph and Durant don't seem to play that well against him.
Yeah, but the Warriors had it won last year if it hadn't been for Draymond getting suspended and now have Durant too! I say Warriors win in six.
Well, I guess we'll find out soon enough.  Go Cavs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the Cats play basketball last night?
Yeah, the played Louisville?
Oh, the big rivalry game?  I missed it, how'd they do?
Well, Kentucky started slow shooting poorly from the perimeter
I though Fox was supposed to be their hot hand this year.
He is, but they had to look inside the paint more.  The first half both teams looked bad
So what did Calipari have to do after halftime?
He made a few adjustments.  Monk played a lot more minutes
What was the final score?
89-68 but it was a lot close than that.
Yeah?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think are going to the finals?
It's going to be a rubber match between the Cavs and the Warriors.
Who will come out on top?
Well they both have a victory over the other so it's hard to tell, but I want the Cavs to win.
Lebron is looking scary but the other star players aren't playing their best and they can't win the championship if he doesn't have help.
He makes everyone around him better they'll be fine.
That's not going to be enough against the Warriors.
Well the Warriors are starting Zaza so I think were're covered.
Neither team has lost in the playoffs yet which is incredible.
That's why I say they will meet in the finals again.
Warriors don't have their coach Steve Kerr to help them later in the playoffs.
I think they would need him to win the finals so I hope he gets well soon.
Don't sleep on any of the other teams. Huston and San Antonio have a chance.
Yeah but San Antonio just lost Tony Parker and they can't win a championship without him.
Do you think Huston can contend with the warriors?
I think the might beat them once maybe twice but could not beat them in a series.
You're probably right about that.
But it's the NBA anything can happen.
Guess we'll just have to wait and see.
The sooner the better.

Did you see that Boston got the number 1 pick in the NBA draft?
Well, at least something went right for them this week!
I know! Cleveland has just destroyed them so far in the series.
On their own home court!
Looks like LaBron is on a mission again.
I wonder if they will even lose a game the way they're going!
Well,  the Golden State Warriors might have something to say about that.
Indeed.  Everyone handed them the championship before the season started.
Yeah. But now I'm not so sure.
Not kidding. When LaBron plays like this, he's just a force of nature.
I know I'm not getting in his way.
Can you imagine taking a charge from him when he's got a head of steam up?
No way. That's gotta hurt.
But poor Boston. They were probably feeling pretty good about themselves.
Yep. They've squandered home court advantage, and it hasn't even been close.
Embarassing!
Those Boston fans get pretty nasty when things don't go well.
Yep. They've had a lot of success there, and they always expect maximum effort.
Not to mention, there's always racists in the crowd there.
It's sad. A great historical city, but a few bad apples can ruin a town's reputation in a hurry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did the Knicks give Carmelo that no trade clause?
No clue, he would have signed there no matter what due to the max contract they gave him.
Yeah, and now it is really coming back to bite them cause they clearly want him gone.
Well that's what happens when your GM is running out of control.
Or maybe just doesn't care at all.
True, that is more likely.
And now he is pissing off Kirstaps which is the worst thing he could do.
Yeah I bet he is gone as soon as he can be.
Do you think he will demand a trade?
No, I think he knows that would really damage his image.
True.  Hopefully this time on the Knicks doesn't poison him cause he is really special.
Yeah is is the ultimate stretch player.
Correct, and they are trying to run the dang triangle with him, Melo, and Rose.
Yeah clearly that is not going to work
It just seems like there is no plan.
Maybe that is because there is not.
Well except for Dolan to keep cashing those checks.
Haha, yes it must be nice to own the most valuable team in the NBA and do nothing.
Except hire Phil Jackson to placate the fans.
And then sit back and watch as he runs the team into the ground.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you able to catch the game between Wisconsin and Florida?
Yes, it was highly competitive and went into overtime.
Who was the leading scorer for Wisconsin?
Hayes led the team with 22 points.
Okay, who led Florida in scoring?
Allen had 35 points for Florida.
Wow, he dominated the game.
I agree. He also hit 4 three pointers.

Showalter led the team with 7 rebounds.
On the other side, who had the most rebounds for Florida?

Chiozza led his team with 5 assists.

Wisconsin had 16 turnovers.
Okay, so what was the final score between both teams?
Wisconsin had 83 points while Florida scored 84 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the playoff last night between the Wizards and the Celtics?
Yea I did! It was a pretty good game!
I know, I can't believe they were 2-1 in its series against the Boston Celtics.
It's unreal! They now have a 116-89 win at the Verizon Center behind 24 points, eight assists and three steals from John Wall.
Crazy. What about that game with Jazz and the Warriors?
Dude, I can't believe the Jazz hung in there!
Yea, they were pretty tough considering the Warriors steamrolled its way to an 18-point advantage through a quarter.
Let's talk about the stats my friend!
Okay, who do you want to start with?
Let's look at Kevin Durant!
He didn't give them a steal, he scored 25 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists.
He's definitely one of my favorites.
What about Stephen Curry?
That's my man!
He did great! Very impressive with 23 points and seven assists.
Never fail to impress me!
I think Draymond Green was on fire as well.
He played very well, 21 points, seven rebounds, six assists and four steals.
Super stoked! I can't wait for the next game.
I look forward to it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What have you thought of the NBA playoffs?
They've been great - the best teams are coming out, obviously.
Definitely, the Warriors and Cavs are really showing off what they have. No surprise, I suppose.
Yeah - I think it's going to be a rematch of the last two years.
It's hard to believe that those teams can remain on top for so long
Lebron really is showing off how good he is. He's only 32 and has three championships and been in four other finals?
Something like that. It's crazy. I thought Steph Curry would be the next one, but he's only three years younger than Lebron.
So do you think Lebron is the next Jordan?
No, that's impossible, but he could have even more of a legacy due to social media and stuff now.
It's shocking to see what younger kids are into and how influenced they are by social media.
So what team are you rooting for?
I'd like to see Lebron win again - but I don't really care about the team. What about you?
I don't care about the tournament as much, but it is interesting to see him win and win again.
The outspokenness of many of the league stars is shocking to me.
Yeah, it really comes out during the playoffs
Everyone seems to have their opinions and they are often out there.
It's a lot different than the NHL playoffs, which are going on at the same time, where the players specifically talk about the game to the media.
It's almost like the NBA players have a pre-made speech during their press conferences and only say what they want to, not answering questions.
I saw that Durant said to not watch the playoffs if people thought they were boring.
Yeah - that's shocking. I can't imagine one of your top players ever encouraging fans not to watch the playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
What's going on?
Not much you?
Same.  You into basketball?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you have a team you like?
I tend to like the Clippers.
Cool, I like the Celtics.
Nice.
I always thought the Clippers would be better.
Yeah they had the talent just didn't go anywhere.
Do you think they all stay again for another year?
I can't see Blake and Chris Paul staying together no.
I can't see that either.
They are going to go for more money elsewhere.
That's what I think too.
Hope they can rebuild.
Nice chatting.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you see any possible Finals that wouldn't be Cavs-Warriors at this point?
It would shock me if it was anything else.
I just can't see either of those teams losing four times in a series to anyone else.
If it's Boston I guess they have a chance, since they have home advantage.
Yeah, but Cleveland went in there last month and beat them by 25.
True, and San Antonio doesn't seem healthy in the West.
Boston at least may get the No.1 pick the draft.
How would that work?
They have someone's pick through a trade in the past, I want to say New Jersey
I'm hoping the Suns get the top pick. A 55-win team doesn't deserve to also get the top pick.
Who do you take if you are Phoenix and you get the top one?
Maybe Fultz from Washington..who else is there, Ball?
Yeah, Ball or maybe Jackson from Kansas.
I wonder about all of them. If Fultz is so great, how did Washington go 2-16 in league play?
Well then there is the headache of getting Ball, or should I say his dad.
And Jackson just doesn't seem like a franchise player...I guess I would take Fultz.
Trading down would also be a possibility. Plus Ball said he would only play for Lakers.
Did he say that or his dad?
I don't remember, but he just seems like he would fit in L.A.
Well Phoenix is fairly close to Los Angeles at least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Are you a basketball fan?
Yes I am.
Me too, which team do you like?
I am a fan of the Cavs.
Oh cool, I like the Rockets.
Gotcha.  Who is your favorite player?
I like James Harden.  you?
The king, Lebron James.
Lebron is great.
He is the man.
Do you think you guys will win it all this year?
Yeah I do, we are looking good.
Do you think Boston will give you any trouble?
No, I think we have their number.
I like the confidence!
It's easy with the king.
Well, good luck to you guys.
Thanks.

This kid has some NBA scouts drooling already. Huge pickup! Good job Tommy!
Also, Ronny was just in Paris, so he may have assisted on this one...Thanks Mr. Turiaf!
Listed as 6'4" with a 6'8" wingspan. Wow! He's very young.. if we land Brown this weekend, is Ayayi a Redshirt candidate?
In the past we've been told that coaches preferred not to redshirt players from overseas. Larsen redshirted primarily because he got hurt.
Could be a crowded backcourt next year!
So he's long, quick, and a good shooter. But he's also skinny, not developed enough as a ball handler to be a point guard, and could improve on defense. I'm guessing he won't be a true point for us. Very intriguing player though. I'm thrilled.
In the past we've been told that coaches preferred not to redshirt players from overseas. Larsen redshirted primarily because he got hurt.
Could be a crowded backcourt next year!
Why is that? Cause it's not worth the travel to sit for a year?
Looks like he's class of 17'. He just announce his commitment to Gonzaga (via twitter) and will play next year.
Great news, time for a trademark change (unless France exits from the European Union): Gonzaga EUniversity Basketball, or Gonzaga UNiversity Basketball.
Congrats!
My first thought?
Defensive length.
It is now a must.
I miss Mike Hart
Do you mean that the team desperately needs defensive length now or that it appears that the Zags are actively recruiting lengthy players for defense and Ayayi is another example of that?
Like Domas and Tille, if he played high school ball in the States he would possibly be a Mickey D's AA. But to be clear, he is a 2017? He's super young, may plan to redshirt him and let him learn and physically mature. Huge Get nonetheless!
Really, he can drive, shoot and handle the rock. This is another "under the radar" recruit by Tommy.
GU is set at the guard position. If we can polish it off with an immediate impact big (grad transfer) and maybe chase jeter to stash away for next year, we'll be set (jj Jones to get the last scholly?).
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do the warriors pay all of these players?
You know, I've been wondering that.
They have so many good players. How do they fit under the cap?
I dont know. Iguodala is still very well paid.
You know what I think they did?
What did they do? What do you think?
They signed these players before the contacts increased?
Oh so before Timofey Mizgov became a billionaire?
And before Evan Turner made as much money as Stephen Curry.
Yea, what a great world that was.
Whatever the case is, the Warriors are really good!
Thats for sure. Are you hoping they get taken down?
I sure am! I would even prefer Lebron over them.
Me too. At least he doesn't have a superteam.
Yea, I agree. He actually has to play his best to win.
Yea and he seems to play his best nightly.
That is true. He is one heck of a player.
It will be in interesting finish for sure.
Yes, whats your pick?
Warriors over Cavs in 6.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who were the two finalists in the NBA 2005 game?
I think, they were San Antonio spurs and the Detroit Pistons.
Do you remember the MVP of the NBA 2004-2005 season?
Yes, it was Tim Duncan from the Spurs.
How did the teams score in the 2004-2005 finals?
Well, as far as I can recall, it was Detroit 22-3 and San Antonio 28-2.
Who won the 2006 NBA finals?
I am pretty sure that the Miami Heat won the title in six games over the Dallas Mavericks that season.
Was Dwayne Wade the chosen MVP for the 2006 NBA season?
Yes, you're right, it was Dwayne Wade from Miami Heat.
I was wondering if you remember who their coach was?
I think it was Pat Riley, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.
Did the Celtics win the 2009 or the 2008 NBA finals?
Celtics were the winners of the 2008 NBA finals and they won against the Lakers.
Was the MVP from Celtics too?
Yes, the MVP was Paul Pierce from the Celtics.
Who won the NBA championship in the 2009 and 2010 season?
That was my favorite team, the Lakers.
Wasn't your favorite player Kobe Bryant the chosen MVP that season?
Yes, Kobe Bryant was the MVP that season and he was my favorite player too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the game tonight?
I don't know.
Why do you say that?
It's not going to be a good game?
That's true, but not like anything else is going to be on.
Haha, watching the weather channel going to be more exciting than that game!
There is always next near for the Celtics
Boston is going to be a beast!
Look at the season Isaiah Thomas had before he got hurt.
You are right, plus they have a deep bench.
I know this is wrong, but maybe if LeBron got hurt, it would be a series.
Don't wish that on anyone,... bad karma!!
I wasn't wishing it on anyone, I was just speculating!
Uh huh sure you were.
Who you got in the Spurs / Warriors?
Are you kidding?
Anything is possible! No guarantee that Golden State is going to sweep.
I mean, I guess you are right.
I know I am right, they were up 3-0 on Cleveland last year and look what happened.
You do have a point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so mad right now.
Whats up why are you mad?
I am getting annoyed because the team is doing shitty.
I have not had the time to catch the game yet how shitty are they doing?
They are down by 20 and its the first half.
That is not to bad
Yes it is it is downright shameful.
Your way to hyped over the team
This is the first playoffs game if they lose that is it .
But at least they made it that for to the playoffs most teams do not make it quite that far
I guess your right with that fact
Only a select number of teams makes it far
True as their is over double the teams for the playoffs that do not make it.
Who knows it might not be too late though.
You are correct it is only the first half
they could pick it up and turn it around for the second half
True if they turn it around they could win
and then they can go to the next round you see
Man you are always right
It is just cooler heads prevail bro

Did the Spurs just gifted game 1 to the Warriors?
Oh yeah. They did. Wow!
Stephen Curry is on fire!
Very clutch in the 4th.
Lakers are hoping to get the No. 1 pick.
I hope they do. Can't stand not being in the playoffs.
Lets all laugh at the Clippers!
One and done again!
The real story is Kawhi Leonard.
If he's out then the Spurs are done.
Will Blake Griffin sign with the Thunder?
I don't know but him and Westbrook could be deadly combination to face.
If Lebron doesn't win this ring then he's not one of the greatest to play the game.
Seriously, all the great one's are retired or past their prime. It's open season for championship rings.
Carmelo is a joke.
I want him out of my Knicks. He's done nohting!
How i miss seeing Kobe play.
The game is just not the same anymore.
Did you watch this week's Shaqtin' A Fool?
The flop was hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you able to see the match between Wisconsin and Villanova?
Yes, Villanova was upset by Wisconsin.
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
Yep, Villanova couldn't make shots.
Which player scored the most points for Wisconsin?
Hayes led Wisconsin with 19 points.
Which Villanova player had the most points?
Hart had 19 points for Villanova.
Who was the leading rebounder for Wisconsin?
Hayes and Happ each had 8 rebounds for Wisconsin.
Who led Villanova in assists?
DiVincenzo led the teams with a paltry 2 assists.
Wow, that probably explains why they lost the game.
Yes, it was definitely one of the main factors.
Okay, who led Wisconsin in assists?
Happ led the team with 3 assists.
Interesting, that is not very good either.
Yes, both teams didn't move the ball very well.
Okay, what was the final score between Wisconsin and Villanova?
Wisconsin won the game with 65 points while Villanova only scored 62 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your strongpoint in basketball?
Probably just making baskets even from a distance.
Me too. I'm looking for members to start a team.
I'd be interested.
OK. We're meeting at Jordan's tomorrow at seven. Can you be there?
Yep. Can I bring Frankie and Luke?
Bring anyone you can think of.
What if we get too many members?
We'll hold tryouts then.
OK. This sounds like fun.
I agree. Basketball is good exercise.
I need to get back in shape so that's good.
We all need to get more in shape I bet.
Probably. All that running and jumping should help.
I hope it does. I want to lose thirty pounds.
I'm so glad there will be a team because I've missed playing.
So have I.
I haven't played in a while.
Neither have I but we'll get back in the swing of things soon.
I'm sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Good morning.
Hello.
How are you.
Well, you?
Fine.  Do you like basketball?
Yes I do.
Do you have a team you like?
I like the Hoosiers.
Oh college, cool.
Yeah I don't care for the NBA very much.
That's okay.
College is more exciting to me.
I like the NBA myself, better skill on show.
I get that, but I think College means more.
I see.
Also, nothing like March Madness.
I do love March Madness.
You can't beat it for excitement.
True.
Bye.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the match between the Houston Rockets and the San Antonio Spurs last night?
Yeah! The last 15 seconds in overtime was the best!
They were trailing by three and put the ball in James Harden's hands thinking he was going to make the shot.
They've been using that gameplay all year.
But it didn't work this time. Manu Ginobili blocked him from behind.
That was the play of the night!
That's probably the last big moment of his career though.
What makes you say that?
Well, he's already 39 and he's been looking old this postseason.
I guess your right, but I must say, crafty plays is what he's done best over his 15 year career.
Yeah, I agree. And he finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and five assists.
True. The Spurs needed all of his performance, especially in overtime.
You can say that again!
Did you see what happened to Kawhi Leonard?
No, I saw him sitting on the bench but I didn't know why.
He hurt his ankle early in the game and never returned.
Oh. I didn't know because I missed the first 30 minutes.
Oh. Harden played a great game this time.
Yeah! He recorded a triple-double with 33 points!
Do you know when the next match is?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So Spurs and Warriors and in the Conference Finals.
Yeah, I hope it is a good series.
It would be nice to see the Warriors tested.
I'd like to see the Spurs pull it out.
I don't think they can.
It will be tough, especially with Parker hurt.
Yeah, I wonder how much he will play.
If at all.
Well at least Leonard should be back.
Yeah they Spurs really need him.
They didn't need him in the last game against the Rockets.
Well that is because the Rockets didn't show up.
Well at least Harden did show up.
Yeah that was crazy, he did not play well.
At all.
It gave Leonard a chance to rest up and heal.
He will need it.
I know the Warriors are going to be at full strength.
Hopefully, I'd like to see Kerr back on the sideline.
I think Pop would like to see that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Fred! Did you watch the Nuggets game last night?!
Yea man, that was a nail biter but Gallinari sure sunk a sweet one for the win!
Yea he did! I wish I could have been at that game. You goin to any games soon?
Actually I am. I'm going when the Suns come to town. I have some really good seats. You wanna join? I have an extra ticket.
I would love to join! I never miss an opportunity to go to the Pepsi Center and see our boys live!!
Fantastic! Nuggets vs Suns here we come!
I can't wait! I'm hoping our young team can really come together this season. A lot of promise there.
Yea they really have to come together cause our Western Conference opponents play some fierce ball.
We'll see what these guys have in them. I know that the individual development I've seen is pretty impressive.
They really have to focus on road games. That's an area needing serious improvement if they want to see the playoffs.
Absolutely. 15-26 on the road is not playoff material.
Seven of our last nine are on the road! That is going to be crucial.
I think Beasley is going to be a huge factor. And you can see him shake that rookie mentality/play now that it's his second year.
Agreed. And you can really start to see the team build around Jokic.
We are making progress that's for sure. Probably won't be this year but watch out next year!
Yea I think we will make the playoffs but won't go anywhere. Still need time to build.
Yea. Did you see Bradley's jersey got retired at his high school where he played.
No I didn't! That's awesome. The kid definitely showed his talent from day one.
Murray is having a speedy recovery too which is nice.
Yea Coach Hess is really focusing on him and his recovery. A lot of special workouts and PT. Well, I'll catch you later. Don't forget about the Suns game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow! The NBA playoffs are sure strange this year.
Yes, I know. There have been so many blowouts.
Right.  How about the way the Celtics were demolished by the Cavaliers the other night.  Man, that was ugly.
The Celtics are definitely done.  They might have had a slight chance against the Cavs but now that they've lost Thomas there's no way.
I agree. And the Warriers sure are hammering the Spurs.
I have a little sympathy for the Spurs.  Popovich is a great coach and I like his willingness to speak out about Trump.
Yea. And they've had so many injuries.  Losing Tony Parker was horrible and now they've lost another player.  Not even Pop can work miracles.
True.  And even the Warriors have had a major loss -  their coach!
Agreed.  Steve Kerr is one of the best in the business and its too bad his perrenial back problems are keeping him on the sidelines.  I hope the Warriors can overcome his absence.  I think they will.
Steve Kerr was having a great career in Tucson as a player at Arizona when I lived there.  Sometimes I used the research library at the U of A and I would occasionally see him there taking care of classwork.  He was a quality person.
Steve is a good man.  He would make a great President, unlike that clown we have now.
It's nice to have basketball and other sports as a distraction when the country is falling apart.
Hey, what about a pick-up game this afternoon. Are you up for that?  I need some exercise.
You know I am!  Can we wait until late afternoon when it's a bit cooler? You know how I sweat like crazy when I play basketball.
Yeah, I remember.  I'll bring a cooler full of ice and drinks.  You bring what's left of your corner jump shot - otherwise you'll get destroyed.
Okay, okay.  I get the message.  I am slowing down a bit with my advancing age.  I'm almost twenty-five!
Thinking about retiring, are you?
No way.  I wanna be playing basketball on the day I die.
Okay.  See you at five or so.  I'll take it easy on you to keep you alive for one more day, at least.
Hey, remember how we used to shoot hoops nonstop for hours in your driveway when we were in junior high?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which teams do you think will meet in the Finals?
That is pretty obvious, considering how the playoffs are going.
You're right. So do you think the Cavaliers have a chance?
With the way Lebron is playing right now, I certainly believe they'll give the Warriors a good run.
Lebron looks amazing right now, but the Warriors seem unstoppable.
That's true. The Cavaliers barely edged out the Finals last year, and that was before the Warriors picked up Durant.
That is certainly a game changer.
Absolutely! The best team in the NBA last year acquiring one of today's greatest players has certainly elevated them to another level.
That makes four All-Stars in one team.
Well, the Cavaliers have three: Lebron, Kyrie and Kevin Love.
Let's be realistic. They are Eastern Conference All-Stars.
That is very true. There is a big competitive gap between teams from the Eastern Conference and teams from the Western Conference.
There is almost no comparison.
Yeah, the Cavaliers certainly had an easier road to the Finals than the Warriors.
That, however, gives the Warriors much more experience against high level competition.
That experience will certainly play a role.
I believe the Warriors will close it out in six games.
That is if they don't sweep the Cavaliers.
That's hard to imagine. The Warriors will almost surely take the crown, but Lebron and the Cavaliers are too competitive to lose four games straight.
That is true. They'll put up a good fight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I scored three points at my game today. I've never scored points before.
That's awesome. I wish I played.
Lance is leaving the team so you could always try out for his spot.
When is he leaving?
Next weekend.
I will try out if you want.
I bet you'd make it. Talk to Tyler about it.
I need to work on my dribbling, though.
Let's practice right now.
DO you have a ball here?
I have the one from Dave and Buster's.
I love that ball. It's a good one.
A good ball makes dribbling easier.
Any pointers for me?
Just keep trying.
Like this?
Haha, with one hand.
This is hard work.
Tyler helped me so maybe you could practice with him too.
I hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am having withdrawals since the NCAA tournament wrapped up.
No kidding. College basketball is the best. Especially ACC!
Did you see that Grayson Allen is coming back for his senior year?
Yes, what a jerk. I'm sure no NBA team would touch that cheater baby.
He definitely needs to mature. UVA lost some of their guys that weren't getting enough play.
Tony's pack line defense is a thing of beauty, but it's not for everyone.
Have you ever been to a game at JPJ?  What a great venue.
I went to the Virginia Tech game last year.
Don't you love Buzz?
For sure. He has turned Tech's program around. Have you ever been to Cassell?
I haven't. Too far to drive down and back for a game. Evan goes to the games when he remembers to get tickets.
Sweet. It looks so small compared to JPJ.
Are there any other teams you follow?
Sure. I follow Mason and VCU.  I was really bummed when Shaka went to Texas. He was such a great coach.
We did go to Richmond to see a VCU vs. Mason game. VCU's fans are rabid.
No kidding. I know just what you mean. Loved seeing him coach.
I follow Iowa State too. Monty Morris graduated this year so not sure what their team will look like next year.
They'll need some Hylton Magic for sure.
Ready for football? We've got our tickets for the VT/WVU game in September.
That will be a great game. Looking forward to seeing them play at Fed Ex Field. Go Hokies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Chris Paul stay in LA?
I dont think so.
They have to break up that team.
Theyve comitted money to other guys though
Yeah but Griffin and Paul cannot coexist.
You think they conflict?
I think they are secondary players that need to remain in the background.
So will they trade them?
They are both free agents.
Thats interesting
Yeah so they are gonna end up losing both for no compensation
So this team reverts back to the early 90s style?
I dont think it will ever be that bad.
Do you have faith in their front office?
No but Doc Rivers is smart.
He had success when he had mega teams.
Right but he did flourish in Orlando.
But couldnt do much until he got the big three.
Listen hes a good coach and wont let the team sink
You dont know that for a fact!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Yo.
How are you?
All good.
Same here.  You into basketball?
Yeah I love it.
Got a team?
I'm a Hawks fan.
Cool, I like the Rockets.
James Harden is a beast.
Yeah he is my favorite player?
I like Lebron.
Anybody else you like besides Lebron or Steph?
Hmm let me think.
Take your time.
I like Westbrook.
Yeah MVP.
That's right he did get that.
Take it easy.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will draft Lonzo Ball.
I think he ends up a Laker.
Oh really. How would that happen.
Lakers make some trades to get him.
It would be amazing to seem him stay in SoCal, but can you really build a team around h im.
I think so. He is going to be an All Star.
Well, Lakers need some hope. What a mess.
Yeah, they're my favorite team and it's sad to see how bad they are.
Who do you think makes the biggest improvement next season?
I'm thinking Wizards.
Did you get out to any games this year.
Only a couple. Ticket prices along with parking are really a lot of money
A friend gave me tickets to a Bulls game.
That sounds like fun. I've never been to Chicago.
Do you think Porzingas stays in New York.
I think he's basically running the team now with Anthony out of the way.
Who do you think was MVP this year.
That's a hard one.  Westbrook was amazing.
I hope they focus more on basketball this year and less on politics.
Yeah, pretty sick of all of the political crap.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the Celtics play the Cavs tonight?
Yeah, what time is it?
It starts at 8:30.  Who are you rooting for?
I wanted the Celtics to win, but they're getting crushed right now.
Yeah, 86 points last game?  That's embarrassing.
Seriously.  The Cavs lead by 41 points at halftime.
Who can come back from that?
It would take a miracle.  Can you imagine losing on home court like that?
I wouldn't want to show my face in public.
That press conference afterwards was tragic.
That's what happens when Isaiah Thomas gets injured and he's the one you count on most.
I heard he's out for the rest of the playoffs.
The Celts are DONE.
Better luck next year, guys.
Yeah.  The Cavs are unstoppable right now.
It's a good thing LeBron came back.
True, but he didn't score all those points by himself.
Maybe not, but he really lit a fire under their butts.
Fair enough.  Did you see how he's not an MVP finalist this year?
Yeah, what's up with that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do the Celtics have any chance of taking a game from the Cavs?
I don't think so. Lebron seems driven to take this title as quickly as possible.
Yeah, they haven't lost a game these playoffs, have they?
No, and the Celtics have now dropped seven, so they've only saved themselves one game to rest.
They seem pretty run down.
They do have a decent bench.
They do. It's not as experienced as the Cavs, but probably just as good.
I wouldn't be surprised if Stevens finds some rotation scheme to make the last two games a bit more competitive.
If the outside shooters hit some shots at the beginning of a game, things could be different.
Olynyk needs to step up again for sure.
Bradley has been a bit off as well.
And even Thomas.
Tristan Thompson has been killing them on the glass early on as well.
Yes, for sure. Stevens doesn't have much in the way of a response for that available, though.
Perhaps he should start more energy guys.
He did Green already, who else?
Jaylen Brown?
True, he's been getting after the boards.
Getting the rookie some more hard playoff minutes might be the best they can salvage from this series now.
Yeah, and at least with games every other day, the series will be over soon and they can turn to the draft.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really think the Celtics are setting up to be a dynasty
I hope so but they will never be the dynasty they were in the 80s
I grant you there is no Larry Bird but the rest of the core are much younger and more athletic
but they don't have Larry  Bird or anything close
not right now but they are a finals caliber team and are going to get the # 1 pick in the draft
I hope they get there but  they still wont have the mystique of the old days
Yes I give you that  . Stern and Jordan really set basketball back a long ways taking it from a team game to 1 on 1 star matchups
yup they don't even pass anymore
This is why i prefer college basketball
me too  even that game is ending up more and more like the pros lowering the shot clock, isolation game .  etc...
They cant ruin college basketball too much . They can make it top heavy  so that the Carolinas and Kentuckys will always win the championship  but the lower conferences are..
yes the lower conferences will always be watchable with good team basketball
Isnt it great when those lower seeds play good team basketball stay all 4 years in college  and beat those factories
Thats why CBS pays billions to broadcast it
A chance to win a lot of money in your local bar bracket doesnt hurt either
I wouldnt know i havent won since 1995
ohthat was a great tournament  UCLa won it right ?
yup I am forever indebted to Tyus Edney
That was the most amazing play  !!!
Right ut they will forever show laettners basket because it was Duke and Kentucky
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Doing good today?
Yep, you?
Yes.  You like basketball?
I do like basketball.
What time do you like?
I like the Rockets.
Oh cool, I like Golden State.
Nice, I like steph a lot.
Yeah, he is a great player.
Yeah, I think he'll be in the hall of fame one day.
Me too. Who's your favorite player?
I like James Harden.
Yeah he is a beast.
No doubt.
Well nice talking to you.
You too.
Good luck with your team.
And with you guys, hope you win it all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the playoffs between the Golden State Warriors and the Spurs?
Yes. It was an amazing game.  The Warriors out played them.
I couldn't believe Steph Curry and Kevin Durant's performance. Did you see that dunk in the first period by Durant?
Yes. He just blew in and dunked the ball as if no one was there.
I can't believe how many 3 pointers Steph Curry hit.
He just amazes me how he can hit those shots as if he was a foot away from the basket.
I couldn't believe Green's performance coming off the bench.
Yeah. He is without a doubt the best sixth player they have.
Remember how they lost the series last year when Green wasn't able to play in that playoff game.  He is a clutch player.
Could you believe how the Warriors ran up the points during the game.  They really outplayed the Spurs.
I can't wait to see the series final when they play the Cleveland Cavaliers again this year.
It should be an amazing re-match in the finals. Both teams are on their game.
Lebron is such a super star. They have a great bench too for backup.
However, the Warriors have Steph, Durant and Green.  This should make this an amazing match-up.
I'm forecasting that this year the Cavs will take the series 4 games to 2.
I'm not sure.  The Warriors are so good and want revenge this year. I bet it will come down to the final game.
I agree both have strong offense and defense. However, the edge probably goes to the Cavaliers.
The defense is probably stronger for the Warriors when they are on their game.  Right now they are hot.
Well it will be interesting to watch the series and see how it plays out. How about a bet on this game. I'll take the Cavs.
You got it. I'll take the Warriors that they will win the finals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the game between the Celtics and Wizards last night?
Of course! It was the only NBA game on last night.
Yes, that's right.  All the other series are decided.
Yes.  It was a great game though.
Did you think the Wizards would be able to pull it out?
It was really looking bad for them at the end there.  The Celtics had the lead.
I agree.  I thought the Wizards season was over at that point.
Yes, it was some extremely clutch basketball by them at the end of the game.
John Wall is just an amazing player.
Agreed.  He hit the game winner.
I don't think Wall gets the recognition he deserves like other point guards.
Agreed.  It's all about Harden and Westbrook this season, but Wall might be a more complete pure point guard.
Even in this series, it's mostly been about Isaiah Thomas.
I mean that's fair, Thomas has been absolutely amazing.
But so has Wall, right?
Yes, both have been playing some amazing basketball.
Okay, so what do you think happens in Game 7?
You have to go with the home team, especially in Boston.  All that history!
That being said, Game 7s are always a bit of a crapshoot.
Agreed.  All I know is I will be watching!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching any of the playoffs?
Yeah, but I'm not sure why.
What do you mean?
Well, Cleveland just beat the Celtics by 55 and the Spurs are hurt.
Yeah, that was a blowout.  Up 41 at the half.  Jeez.
There is more parity in football.
Maybe, but think about the finals.
I think I was already thinking about the finals before these last matchups even started.
So you think they should just end the season and then let the Cavs and Warriors play to see who's boss?
Sort of.  I mean I don't expect buzzer beaters every game but all the games seem to be one sided, no matter who wins.
Yeah, you're right, things have been a little boring so far.
But the Warriors-Cavs final should change all that.
I hope so, I like watching playoff basketball.  Who do you think is going to win?
Well, LeBron seems like a player of destiny.
But the Warriors seem more well rounded.
I would never count out LeBron, or bet against him for that matter.
You are probably right.  I just hope we see a good series.
You don't like 41 point leads at the half?
Not at all.  Give me overtime!
Let's just get the real party started.  The finals!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did the Spurs take out their starters so quickly last night?
That's just how their coach does things.
Who will win the championship?
It will probably be the Warriors.
Are you excited for the draft lottery?
Yeah! My team might get two picks this year, but it depends on the results.
Who will win between the Celtics and the Wizards?
Well it looks like the Wizards have been dominating so far, so I'd have to go them.
Are you going to watch the summer league?
Most likely not.
Who's the best player in the league?
Unless Lebron proves me he's not the best player, he is.
Who's the MVP this year?
It's tough, but I have to go Harden.
Did you go to any games this year?
Yeah, I have a partial season ticket plan.
Who's the next coach that's going to be fired?
I hope it's Casey for Toronto.
Who will win between the Spurs and Rockets?
It'll be really close, but Rockets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the semi-finals
It doesn't seem that exciting
I know, it is clear that it will be golden state and cleveland again
Same as last year
Do you think one is going to to be perfect
Probably golden state, the spurs seem done
LeBron is not the same but they could do it
Yeah but I am not sure they are going to repeat, golden state learned from their mistakes
Agreed, if they are down 3-1 they are not coming back
I am going to watch all the games though
Who is better, LeBron or Curry
I still like LeBron but Curry is more subtle
i think he is a better leader on the team
That is a good point, they seem to gel better
I think it is a stronger team and that is why it will go perfect
Will they go perfect through the finals
No, I bet that Cleveland will win at least one game
I think they will win 2
You wanna bet that Golden State wins 4-2
I think you are right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, did you check out that Warriors vs Spurs game earlier today?
I sure did, it was game 1 of the Western Conference Finals and that crowd was going crazy!
The warriors were down big time in the first half. In fact, I think they actually fell behind by like twenty five points.
I know, I could not believe that the warriors were able to come back and win the game!
It did not really surprise me to be honest with you. I mean, they do have Steph Curry and Kevin Durant at their disposal so anything is possible for them.
That is true, but I was still very surprised. It sure did not help things when Kawhi Leonard went down with that ankle injury though.
Yea Kawhi is gonna have to get that ankle taken care of, the spurs have no chance without him!
I dont know dude, the spurs have some other really good players. I think they could still give Golden State a run for their money.
I feel ultimatley the warriors will just be to much and beat the spurs in five games. Mark my words, they will not need six games to end this series.
You may be right, but I still do not think it's wise to doubt the spurs. After all, they are a great organization that knows what it takes to be champions.
It is going to be the warriors and cavs in the finals; I can not wait for that one!
Yea me either, Lebron will be going for his second straight NBA championship. I think he will get it but it is going to be a battle.
There is no question about that, I think that series will go seven for sure.
It should be the best finals we have ever seen, who do you have winning it?
That is a very hard question, I could really see this one going back and forth! I just do not know who will take home the trophy,
Come on man, you have to pick a winner! Who ya got?
Alright I will pick a winner, it is just really hard! I think I am going to go with the Warriors, they just have to many weapons for anyone to deal with.
Yea having just Durant and Curry would make any team special. However, adding Draymond Green and Klay Thompson makes them almost unbeatable!
Either way it is going to be a fun series to watch. I am sure looking forward to it!
Me and you both buddy, we will just have to set back and see what happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow basketball?
Not as much as I used to. What about you.
I watch as many games as I can, including college and professional.
Yeah? Well, I usually check out the scores, but don't really watch many games. Whose you favorite pro team?
I grew up in California, so I always root for the Lakers.
Me to. They've had some great teams and great players over the years.
I know they usually come up with some great player combinations. Remember when they had Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.
That was a great combo. You can talk about your Jordans all you want, but I love to watch Baylor play.
He was really something. He used to actually get hangs time when he went to the basket.
Hang time? What do you mean by that?
For some reason if he and another player jumped at the same time, he seemed to stay up in the air longer and it gave him an advantage.
Oh. I didn't realize that, but he was fun to watch. My favorite was Magic Johnson.
I know, he just had a way of controlling the whole game.
He did. He was a winner. There's just something about some players. They just have a way of winning no matter what.
Right. Did you ever play much basketball.
Nope. I'm too short, and I don't jump very well. Maybe that's why I don't follow the game all that closely.
Yeah. Basketball is made for tall people. Wouldn't it be great if they had a league with a height limit? Nobody over six feet.
Then they could lower the basket so that six footers could dunk.
It's interesting to think about. Do you think you would play more then?
Nope. I'm still too short.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm going to the Lakers game tonight. Do you want to come with?
Sure. What time does it start?
Around 7. They're playing against the Cavaliers.
That should be a good match up.
Sounds like it. I miss the days of Kobe and Shaq, though.
Those were epic times in basketball.
Yeah, I don't think we'll see anything like it again.
There's plenty of young talent out there.
I know, but I just don't get as thrilled as I used to.
Then why do you still watch them play?
Because I'm a fan. It's my duty to support the team.
Not me. I dropped the Bulls like a bad habit after Jordan left.
That's because you're not a fan of the team. You're a fan of a player.
That player made the team what it was and no one's been able to do it since.
Well, maybe you're right.
Of course I am. What time are you picking me up?
I want to get there early so be ready by 6.
What seats did you snag?
Third row.
Pretty good. Should be a fun evening.

The Wizards defeat the Celtics here in Game 4 to tie the series.
The series is tied at 2 a piece and game 5 will be in Boston on Wednesday.
Yup tune in at 8 PM on TNT.
Now its a best of 3 series, and Boston has 2 home games and only 1 away game.
Neither team has won on the road yet this series.
Lets see if the Wizards can take care of business Wednesday and secure the first away win of the series.
That Celtics crowd will be loud on Wednesday night!
Rightfully so, I think it will be an electric atmosphere, and they have every right to be.
Did you know the Celtics have gone down at least 20+ points in every game this series...
They are lucky to be tied in this series, and you'd have to imagine the Celtics would hopefully avoid being down 20 at home in game 5.
I like the Celtics chances, I definitely think this will go 7 games.
I do too... and I have no clue who would win Game 7.
I'd have to give the slight edge to the Celtics just because it will be at TD Garden in Boston.
Yeah but John Wall has been eating the Celtics alive, hes been so crafty, getting his teammates involved, scoring a ton of points and assists.
Only time will tell, I guess we will just have to wait and see. As we know the Cavs have already advanced to the eastern conference finals.
That will be a tough task for either of these teams as the Cavs are undefeated so far this postseason.
You got to think the Cavs will beat either team, and the Cavs will prob advanced to the finals.
Yeah I think I agree with you there, and I don't think the Cavs care who they get... Lebron seems to be on a mission this year again this postseason.
Well thank you for tuning in, again the Wizards have beat the Celtics thanks to a 26-0 run in the third quarter, to tie the series at 2 a piece.
It's been a pleasure to be with you guys, we will see you Wednesday night in Boston for game 5!!!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Westbrook?
He is good
I agree. It's too bad there is a lot of negativity there.
No, it's not. He will grow out of it.
Yeah, I guess. I was sad about the split with Kevin Durant.
Same here. They were great friends.
I hope the Spurs get Leonard back.
I don't think he will be back this year.
How do you feel about the draft?
Ball will go second I think.
I think that Fultz guy will go first.
What team do you think will get better?
The Timberwolves will hopefully get better.
Wiggins is really good.
I'm a big Suns fan, so hopefully they draft someone good.
I'm sure they will.
Who is your pick next year?
I think the Spurs will win it all.
That would be cool. They haven't won it in awhile.
Well, if Pachulia is in the league, anything can happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see the last Cavs game ?
Oh man ! Yes I did.
How embarrassing is that for the Boston Celtics to lose by that many point ?
I know, right ?
Yeah, they didn't even try to come back.
Yeah I agree. They threw the towel at the half time.
I switched the channel at half time.
I did too, the eastern conference finals shouldn't be THAT boring.
I think it's all LeBron James's fault. He is just too good for the other teams.
Yeah, there is no excitement cause he se the goat.
Did you see the Cavs bench having fun before the halftime on every shot.
Haha yes, but did you see J.R. Smith's last shot ?
Oh, that was a beauty. And they got the record for biggest half-time lead with that shot.
So, who you got in the finals ?
Thats a though one. Both Cavs and Golden State Warriors are too good.
When someone has to win ?
Yeah I think it would be LeBron. He is just too good, man.
You think that GSW will choke again ?
Counting on it haha.
We will see what Kevin Durant has to say about that haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId you see the cavs game?
yeah they blew the celtics out!
biggest loss in lebron james history which is crazy
Yeah seems like a collision course with the warriors is bound to happen
Yep and also I read that Isaiah Thomas is out the rest of the playoffs
Yep something to do with his kneee
Yeah makes tonight's game not as interesting anymore
Yep I might just go outside insetaed of watching
yep gotta wait for that finals rematch
Who do you think wins?
If if was a betting man id say the warriors but I really want the cavs to win
I also want the cavs to win and they are on a tear!
yeah they are!
I think it comes down to game 7 and who wants it more between these 2 teams
Yeah I just think that the cavs are a little better and more of a team than the warriors
Yeah i can see that. Most of them have been playing together for a while
Lets just hope zaza pachulia doesn't hurt anyone else!
I hope he doesn't the warriors always get lucky with injuries to the other team!
Yep the year they won all pg's they played against missed most games in the playoffs
Yeah that is just unfair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you see the Lakers doing to get George?
I still don't see it happening, they are bad...really bad and would still have to trade something of value.
Do you think the Lakers become a contender with George?
No way- they still don't have enough.
Who do you pick....Warriors or Cavs.
Cavs in 6, the warriors will put up a fight but it still won't be enough.
Where do you see Blake Griffin going?
I would love to see him in New Orleans.
What about Hayword?
I want him in New Orleans too, either one would be fine with me.
Durant is also a free agent.
Yeah, but he isn't going anywhere and I see him retiring as a Warrior.
Who is the best pure shooter in the NBA?
Thats easy: Curry.
I  think the best fit for Griffin would be the Thunder.
Oh man, they would instantly become a favorite to win the west.
In their prime who would you pick Paul or Stockton?
Paul just because I feel as though he's a better shooter.
How old is Paul Milsaps?
32
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch much college basketball this year?
Yeah, especially during March Madness!
The tournament was great this year wasn't it?
It was good basketball. Less upsets than usual though.
I agree. I think a lot more teams are stronger now.
That's probably true. A lot of the smaller schools can really compete.
Did you think Villanova would repeat?
I was hopeful they would, but I didn't think so.
Me neither. It's so hard to repeat, and they lost some good starters.
Yeah, but I like how most of their players stay all four years.
Same. I'm not much of a fan of one-and-done players.
I think it takes some of the purity out of the game.
Some schools are just player mills to produce professionals.
I guess they have a place, but I prefer players who are truly student-athletes.
Yeah, I guess it's nice to have both.
True. I like seeing those young superstars as well as the seasoned seniors.
I'll be interested where players go in the NBA draft.
Yeah, it's really a great draft class.
Some of the teams who have early picks are very young, so the draftees could make a big impact quickly.
It should be fun to watch them grow in the NBA.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard that the Kings are playing the Falcons tonight, want to go see the game?
No, last time I watched them play was just yesterday and they did just aweful
Do you not like basketball?
I do like basketball but would rather play then watch.
Even pro games?
I  mean they can be fun to watch but honestly I just have too much add for that
HAHA, you are a funny guy, but sports are about getting better and comeradery
What do you think of that team anyway?
Well I once was a huge fan but I have recently found that I would rather root for the Wildcats
Oh who do they play for?
They are my schools home team so I sort of feel like they must be my fave team.
Well that sounds cool, Who do they play
I think they play the hornets next week.
Who is there best player?
Prolly like player 7 steavonson
He is good I think he made like 200 pts last game
How is that even possible? That seems like a very large amount of points
Oh you would be supprised how high scoring these games can be.
So what was the final score?
It was a tie but I dont know the exact numbers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You think Michael Jordan is a better basketball player than Lebron James?
Yeah, but I think Lebron is a better businessman.
You think Lebron James is a better basketball player than Magic Johnson?
Yeah, but I think Magic is a better businessman.
You think Dennis Rodman who used to play basketball for the Chicago Bulls should be an international ambassordor for the US?
No, Dennis Rodman was carrying information for the government when he was doing all that international stuff?
You think college basketball players who get education scholarships should be treated like school employees?
Yeah, technically they are employees of the schools they attend and are salesmen who bring in revenue when they work I mean play in basketball games.
You think basketball games can be use to reduce violence in Chicago?
No. Those people need jobs and job skills not a gang vs. gang basketball game.
Should women be allowed to play on all male basketball sports teams?
Yes and it's just a matter of time before it become a reality.
How did you learn to play basketball and were you on your high school team?
I never learned how to play basketball. My nephew explained he game to me when I was thirty one and he was sixteen.
You ever participated in a Final Four basketball pool?
Yeah and by doing so is how I learned the game of baskeball.
Who's your favorite basketball player of all time and why?
Bob Love of the Chicago Bulls because he was illiterate but he went back to schoo and learned how to read.
What other major sport besides basketball did Michael Jordan play or tried to play?
Michael Jordan tried his hand at baseball after his run with the Chicago Bulls and before he bought the Washington Wizards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi! Are you a wizards fan?
Yes I am.
Do you watch the games on tv or listen on the radio?
I watch the Wizards on the tv.
Did you see that long time color guy Phil Cheiner has been sacked ?
Yes!
He was on the tv team for 33 years!
I know.
I cannot fathom why they did that.
When I first heard the news I thought he was just retiring.
So did I!
He is not ready to retire.
No he is not. Most of tho other DC tv stations have picked him up for "spot" analisis.
Hr still has a great voice!
Not only that but his comments are spot on.
Yes! He is still very sharp!
I guess they want to go younger.
I suppose..it's a shame.
I think The Wizards think most fans do not remember that he was one of the best shooters in the league.
That and I think that most fans do not remember that he brought Us our Last Championship ring!
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you see the warriors/spurs game yesterday?
yeah, I can't believe Golden State came back
The Kawhi Leonard injury killed San Antonio
They can't compete without him
Yeah, there's no way they can win this series if he can't go
They'll be lucky to win a single game
Even without him though, there's no way they should have lost that game
Yeah, it was one of the largest blown leads in playoff history
Golden State is too good to simply give games away like that
Game 2 is probably a must win now
Yeah it's hard to see anyone beating Golden State four times in five games
Agreed. But San Antonio can never be counted out
Still, if Leonard can come back, the Spurs can definitely hang with Golden State
maybe, but it's hard to see Golden State playing as poorly as they did for the first two and a half quarters
It's pretty clear the Spurs can't really guard Golden State
The Warriors were getting just about any shot they wanted over the last quarter and a half
Still, Leonard is the key
Yeah, he can create his own shot and at least give San Antonio a chance on defense
It was amazing how out of sorts Golden State looked in the first half
It'll be interesting to see how much of that was San Antonio's defense and how much was Golden State simply playing poorly
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really want the Spurs to win the Finals.
Yeah I really like watching Leonard play.
It is nice to see someone play on both sides of the ball for sure.
Yeah the fact he isn't being more considered for MVP is a crime.
I totally agree.
I mean who else in contention plays defense as well as him.
No one, but I mean if we were being serious about MVP Lebron would win each year.
Well that is true but I think we have Lebron fatigue.
Yeah it seems like people do that.
Yeah everyone wants to race to anoint the next great one.
Yup its become a real problem.  If I had a vote it would go to Lebron for sure.
Yeah but I think this year Westbrook is going to win.
Yeah everyone seems to love him.
I am not sure why though.
He only plays offense and he only plays offense for himself.
Exactly.  I am so sick of hearing about him
I think it comes back to always wanting to find the next guy.
Yeah I think you are right.
Lets just agree it should be Lebron
OK and lets also agree the Spurs would be fun to keep watching.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Greetings.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Okay, you?
Okay.  You a basketball fan?
Yeah I love it.
Cool, me too.
Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Celtics.
I like the Thunder.
Shame you guys got knocked out.
Yeah, I thought we'd go further.
Oh well there is always next year.
I hope so.
The Celtics are still in, but I don't know for how much longer.
The Cavs will be tough if you get there.
Yeah that's what I think.
Best of luck.
Thanks, nice to talk with you.
You as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Next game is Saturday.
I am looking forward to seeing this game.
Me too.
Tim Golden has really been playing well.
Yes, he has.
I enjoy watching him with the 3 pointers.
A couple games ago, he made six three pointers.
Yeah, that was some game.
The ticket cost has sure went up.
I wonder how a family with 2 or 3 children can afford to go.
They probably can't unless both parents are working.
You're right and good paying jobs at that.
Why don't we see if our wives want to go Saturday.
Great idea.
If they want to go, let's plan dinner before the game.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Do you have a certain restaurant you would like to go.
Yes, the new Mexican restaurant - Hacienda Fuentes.
Ray and I have been wanting to try that.
OK - it's a deal; I know Debbie will want to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the NBA title this year? I believe the Cavs will repeat.
I am inclined to agree, but the Warriors might be tough.
Yeah, if 2 of the studs from the Warriors get hot, they can take down LeBron.
I agree with that point. If Durant and Curry get hot, they will win.
Don't forget Thompson and Draymond....
I didn't. But can they play enough defense against LeBron?
LeBron can get all the points he wants. It's the other guys they have to stop.
So, you say Lebron can score 60 and the Cavs can still lose?
That's what I'm saying...Just don't let Kyrie or Love have big nights.
I agree. if they do, then Cavs for sure.
Are you even watching the playoffs? They are boring this year.
I don't usually watch until the Finals.
You think anyone can knock off the Cavs or Warriors before then?
No chance, unless someone gets hurt.
I think the Cavs will whip the Celtics in the conference finals.
If the Celtics even make it. Don't sleep on the Wizards.
Yeah, if Wall stays hot, they can take Boston.
But no shot against the Cavs though.
They could win a game or 2 at most against the Cavs.
You're absolutely correct. No way the Cavs go down
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cavs and Celtics games the other night?
No, I missed it, what happened?
The Cavs blew out the Celtics by 40 points.
Yeah, that's about what I expected.
This just isn't going to be competitive.
I wanted to see the Wizards make it, but I know it wouldn't have made a difference.
Yeah, this was a Golden State and Cleveland final in the making all along.
It looked like the Spurs might have given Golden State a challenge in game one.
They were up 25 points!
I guess Steph Curry might be down but never out.
Well, the Spurs had some bad injury luck too.
Yeah, nothing you can do about that.
Do you think both teams will sweep?
Golden State, probably.
Not Cleveland?
LeBron is good, but I think Boston will steal one.
The Spurs are good too, though.
Yeah, but that injury pretty much killed their shot.
Who do you think will win it all?
Golden State, they're looking for revenge after last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been keeping up with the playoffs?
Yeah, but they've been pretty terrible this year.
I know, they should have just skipped the playoffs and had the finals.
Everyone already knew we were getting a final's trilogy.
Yup, Golden State and Cleveland are just so much better than everyone else.
It's sort of unfair to the rest of the league, don't you think?
Well, both the Warriors and the Cavs have historically been bottom dwellers, so I'm okay with it.
I guess.
Think about it, more than half the titles ever won in the NBA have been won by just two teams.
You're right, the Celtics and Lakers spent decades tormenting the rest of the league.
Exactly, let these two teams enjoy their time in the spotlight, it will be short lived.
You have a rooting interest this year?
I'm torn, it's the best player versus the best team.
I'm siding with the Warriors, basketball is a team sport, I can't stand guys like Lebron James.
I know, but this is like watching this generations Michael Jordan, we can tell our kids, we saw Lebron dominate the league for years and years.
He's also a total egotistical diva.
True, people didn't hate Jordan until after he retired.
Yeah, people have a million reasons to hate Lebron in the past, present and future.
You've convinced me, go dubs!
Chef curry with the shot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are there only two good teams?
Because the best players decided to join on one team.
The Spurs are pretty good too though.
Yeah, but too bad Pachulia took out Leonard.
So, why do you think Durant joined the Warriors?
Because he did. I have no idea what his motives were. We can only guess.
Yeah, it's not fun though when all the good players join one team.
I know. Basketball is pretty silly.
Yeah, what's the overall point anyway?
Teamwork, and fun.
Good points.
What do you think of the draft?
Nothing, it's pretty pointless to care about who the Lakers get.
I miss the Michael Jordan days.
So do I.
There was no James Harden back then.
Yeah, those were the days.
Do you think Harden will ever win?
Who cares?
Good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the Heat still going?
They're doing stupidly well this year.
They haven't lost yet?
Not once.
There's something crazy about that.
It's not like they've got a perfect team.
They've got an absurd line up.
Yeah, but they're not the best.
They're fairly good though.
The NBA in general has weird team set ups.
Yeah.
People just get distributed weird.
That keeps everything going though.
I mean, I guess.
It keeps the teams more dynamic than the NFL.
Yeah, definitely.
Less money and more contracts.
It's more diversified.
Yeah.
It's more complex.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think should happen to the NBA's bottom-feeders?
What do you mean?
Teams like the Magic, Knicks, Pistons, 76ers, Suns, Lakers, Timberwolves.
Yeah, what about them?
They're awful pretty much every year.
So? Doesn't the draft help that?
It helps a bit, but clearly some teams never have playoff-caliber years.
So, I have no idea. What should happen?
I think if a team is bad every year, they should get far more high picks in the draft.
Yeah, why should the team who won the championship even have a chance at the no. 1 pick?
That's awful. If you win the title, and your players are locked up in contracts, you shouldn't get any first-or second round picks.
I agree--maybe make the first round exclusive to teams who were below .400 for two or more years.
What about teams who intentionally lose?
That's a rarity. If in a competitive sport, it's found people intentionally lose, they just flat out shouldn't be paid.
Performance-based pay in the NBA?
Sounds crazy, but why should they get guaranteed contracts playing a game if they don't put forth the effort? If no fans show up they still get paid.
Yeah, but they are drama queens.
Performance-based pay would never work.
Imagine that in real-life. $9/hr flipping burgers but if your productivity goes down you're fired.
Meanwhile in the NBA, if you miss 2/3 of your shots, you still are rich. It's crazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
What's happening?
Not much, you?
Not much.  You like basketball?
Yeah I do.
Who is your team?
I don't really support just one team.
Oh no?
No, I just like seeing the stars play.
Oh I see.
Yeah I am a fan of the superstars.
Like who?
I really like Lebron and Steph.
Of course, they are the best.
Yes they are.
Anyone else.
I like Carmello.
Well good talking to you.
You as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hi, what do you want to talk about?
Is basketball okay?
Basketball is great, I love it
Did you ever play?
I did in high school.  I was hoping to get drafted, but I hurt my leg
Im so sorry to hear that
Thank you, it's okay. I coach basketball now.
At least you still have a career in basketball
Yes, it's so much fun coaching a basketball team.
Are you guys any good?
We win most of the games.
That's great congrats.
Thank you.  Did you play?
No I never did I should have, it looked fun.
It was, the best time of my life. I enjoy watching pro basketball still
I like the la lakers
They are a good team.
I like watching the grizzlies
They are a great team
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Celtics and Wizards game?
Yeah, the Wizards one by one point.
I can't believe John Wall hit that last three point shot.
I know, right over Avery Bradley too.
Who do you think will win game seven?
I think the Celtics will win.
Are you sure, Washington seems to have all the momentum.
That's true, but each team has won at home.
Thomas, Bradley, and the rest of the team need to have a good game.
I believe they will, especially Thomas in the fourth like usual.
They are both doomed when they face the Cavaliers though.
I agree on that, they will get swept or lose in five.
Lebron James has just been too good this postseason.
The Cavaliers are too stacked, for either team to hope to win.
Still, the Celtics and Wizards made great progress.
They are both going to be future contenders and problems for other teams.
Especially the Celtics, with all those draft picks they have.
They will probably land the number one pick this year.
A playoff run and the number one pick, the future is bright in Boston.
Not many teams ever get that type of luck.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like basketball?
I do,  I very much enjoy watching it.  Do you?
I love basketball, I used to play in middle school
I never played, was it fun?
Yes, it was so much fun, I also enjoyed being part of a team.
I wish I did that.   My team is the Grizzlies.  Whose yours?
I like the Boston Celtics
They are a good team.
So are the Grizzlies.  Have you been to any of there games?
All of them. I have season passes. They even give out some cool stuff on different games.
That sounds cool. What have you gotten?
I got a scarf, socks, wrapping paper, and other things.
I've only been to a few games. I don't know if the Celtics do that or not
They probably do, I think all teams do it.
The atmosphere at the games is fun thought, and I love halftime
Yea it's great, we have a super Grizzlies and he does all kinds of funny stuff.
I'll have to check it out if I ever come to Memphis.
It's a great time
It sounds like it  we just have a guy in a wierd hat.
Does he do anything cool?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I tell you the Wizards really disappointed me this year.
Why do you say that?
I just feel like they didn't live up to their potential all of the way
I hear you, but I just feel like they went as far as their talent could take them.
I disagree. To me they had a better team than the Celtics.
I don't know how you could say that when the Celtics had the better record
Yeah they did, but when you look at this roster, I felt they were more equipped for the postseason.
I don't know about that. The Wizards always seem to underachieve
Yeah they do, but that's my point. The talent is there for this team to be better.
Maybe this is just who they are. I mean John Wall and Bradley Beal are a great backcourt, but something is missing.
You mean as it relates to their chemistry?
Yeah. Like this whole team and organization just seem to be lacking something.
I think that something maybe heart.
You are probably right. They just can't seem to get out of their own way sometimes.
I know watching this team can be frustrating at times
You keep expecting more, but again this is who they are.
I think if they can add a few pieces they can be a legitimate title contender.
Again I disagree. I don't know if John Wall is the leader that gets you there.
I love Wall! I just think he needs a couple more guys that fit into their system.
I think he is fool's gold. I'm going to say that Wall never wins a championship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Basketball was my favorite sport as a kid. I loved the Celtics of the 1980s.
Larry bird was by far my favorite player. I was a teen when he was in his prime as a player.
I kind of missed out on the 1981 championship as I was only 7. But I remeber the 1984 and 1986 championships very well.
It was such a memorable time and team. I will never forget it.
My father and I used to watch the games together. My father was one heck of a basketnball player.
I remember one time I watched him play at South High in Worcester, Mass in a pickup game/
He went back and forth with a player who was black. He called himself Larry bird. The other player called himself Magic Johnson
It was fun to watch. Something I will never forget as long as I live.
As I got older, Larry Bird became more injury prone and older. 1st the Lakers became the better team, then the Pistons.
And MJ AND THE bULLS WERE WAITING IN THE WING as well. It was an exciting time to be a basketball fan.
At the same time, I played alot of basketball and became a good player myself. I was an all-star.
I was really good in junior high. But by the time high school rolled around I had lost my motivation  a bit.
I was out of shape and gained some weight. But I continued to play in high school.
It wasn't until my senior year that I made the varisty team. I wore my father's number to honor him.
Even though I did not play much and was not that successful, I still had alot of fun.
I wish I had staye din better shape as I look back at my life. But I have always had my weight issues.
Still, basketball, and the NBA, is something I love. But it isn't the same as it was in the 80s.
Larry Bird is an all-time great. Probably in the top 5-10 all-time players.
Injuries cut back on his career though. It was because he played so hard.
That was sad to see but it was a by-product of how hard he played the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe the season the Pacers are having?
Oh I can believe it. They haven't been the same since Reggie left.
I agree. Did you catch the score against the Lakers?
I think it was something like 92-85. Disappointing.
They have only won one game this season. Super disappointing.
I just don't think their offense is what it used to be.
Or defense, for that matter!
I agree. Really miss the days of Larry Bird coaching.
Me too. When is the next game?
Next Friday against the Chicago Bulls.
Another team that once was so great and now are mediocre.
I doubt they ever come back to where they were with Jordan.
We need more basketball stars. More big names, more big talent.
Yes, other than Lebron James. Not a fan of his.
What team does he play for?
The Cavs.
Have they played the Pacers this year?
Yes, and the Pacers lost pretty badly.
Would be nice to see them in tourney again some day.
One can hope.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the N.B.A playoffs?
i love basketball I have not missed a game.
I grew up watching greats like Magic Johnson and Larry BIrd.
Yes, I miss the good old days of competitive NBA playoff games.
This years playoffs have been in one word, terrible.
I agree, most games have been blowouts and very non competitive.
I have had to turn the channel as a lot of these games are over by half time.
Very disappointing you want playoff games in particular to come down to the final minutes.
I believe both the Warriors and Cavaliers have not lost a game in the playoffs.
Good for them but bad for basketball and its competitiveness.
At Least we can hope for a great championship matchup.
Definitely two great teams on a collision course to play each other.
Great story lines between these two teams that are about to butt heads.
They both have a chip on their shoulders and this should be fun to watch.
I am hoping for a 7 game series and most of all I want to see close and competitive games right to the final buzzer.
Yes I agree please no more blow outs.
So what do you think what is your prediction for this matchup.
The Warriors especially with Kevin Durant I just think they have too much talent.
I disagree I think Lebron James is the best player in the world and will be the diffeence for the Cavaliers.
Should be fun to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Golden State and San Antonio game last night?
Yes. It was certainly closer than the previous two games.
Who won?
Golden State won. They are now up 3-0 in the series.
What was the score?
120-108. San Antonio actually played closer than the score indicated.
Did Kawahi Leonard play for the Spurs?
No. He has an injured ankle.
First Tony Parker. Now Leonard. I don't see how they can operate.
Ginobli stepped up last night. Johnathon Simmons had a good game as well. Aldridge just hasn't been himself in the series.
I believe that Golden State will sweep.
Certainly looks like it. The injuries and lack of consistency are hurting the Spurs.
It looks like it will be a rematch between Golden State and Cleveland in the Finals.
Third year in a row. The rubber match can settle the score for sure.
When does Cleveland play again?
They play today at home.
What is the score in that series?
Cleveland is up 2-0 over Boston. They have been dominating just like Golden State has.
I wonder if any two Finals teams have ever entered the series with undefeated playoff records?
It has never been done. If it happens this year it would be the first time in history.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi Bob, did you see play of last night?
Uh, yeah, it was a great game. Cleveland blew Boston.
Lebron was magnificent.
He played like never before
How much did hi scored last night?
I think 40 points.
He had an excellent performance index.
Oh, that's his average, what do you wonder.
Other teammates from the team Cleveland Cavalier's were on the level.
Yeah,top performers last night.
They won with 40 points difference, what kind of results, right?
I now lead 2-0 in the series.
Two more victories and enter the finals.
I can not wait, it will be a great game, West meets East.
Who should play finale?
With Golden State
Against Curry and boys?
Oh yes
Want to watch the game in a pub?
It is a dill,see you.
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see that article about Kevin Durant?
What about him?
Apparently he removed Russell Westbrook from his phone contacts.
Are you serious? Wow...how do you know?
Because they said that Westbrook tried to call him when he was in town and Durant texted back "Who is this?"
I never thought that would happen, it's a shame. I really don't like Golden State.
Dude, me either. I respect Durant's game but I don't like these things they've been saying about him.
Same here. Russell Westbrook is doing so well though.
Agreed! All those triple doubles, it's insane.
I'm actually trying to get tickets to an OKC game next week. Would you want me to get you a ticket?
Of course man, that would be so much fun!
I'll make sure to do that. I'm really liking Westbrook lately and they're playing the Timberwolves.
Are they from Minnesota?
Yeah! Their team is really stepping it up lately.
Agreed. Karl Anthony Townes is my favorite player probably.
Yeah, way less drama on that team. Plus, they have a great spirit.
I know what you mean. We should try to go to games more often.
Yeah we should. I just hope that I can still enjoy watching the Thunder without Durant.
Yeah its too bad...but I'll see you next week then?
Yes of course!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which conference is the strongest for NCAA basketball?
Mens or womens?
Womens.
I have no idea. I don't watch that because it's crap. Whichever UConn is in.
Okay then. How about mens?
Despite the long-standing dominance of the ACC, they haven't been as good.
They just won the tournament this year. UNC was 33-7 and the national title. Are you blind?
No, you can't watch sports if you're blind. Duke, FSU, Louisville, and Notre Lame all had down seasons recently.
So, who is better?
Bear with me...the Big Ten was the best this year.
What? HOW?
Well, despite MSU's down year (which was due to injuries), they only had three sub-.500 teams this eyar.
So?
Well, Maryland, Purdue, Wisconsin and Michigan were all highly-ranked this year at various points, and pretty much just lost to each other.
You're saying that they just beat each other up?
Yup. Most of the Big 10 team losses were to each other.
I don't buy it, sorry, ACC or bust.
That's so narrow-minded. I bet you support OSU in football, too.
Yeah, I do.
I think your priorities are off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think LeBron retires this season?
No way, if he does I would be shocked.
What happens to Cleveland after that?
They suck forever.
Relative to that, do you think Curry ever leaves Golden State?
In today's NBA, you never know
They have so many superstars that could weather it.
Yeah but nothing transcendant like him.
I think Draymond Green could hold a team together.
We havent seen that yet.
Klay Thompson could be huge but he plays a different role.
He is probably the first to leave.
Yeah I cant see him playing second fiddle much longer.
But some players want to just win.
That would be the only argument that would run counter to what you are saying.
I think hes ripe to be a superstar.
He already is.
Yeah what about Kevin Durant.
I dont know about him, he pissed me off by leaving OKC.
Yeah he shouldnt have done that. But he clearly wants to win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man how's it going? Have you been watching the NBA this year?
Good man. I've been trying to keep up but I don't always have time.
It's been a lot of fun to watch, you've missed some good games let me tell you.
Well tell me! You know I love the Spurs.
I was amazed at how well they've done so far, I was into Houston.
Come on really the Rockets? I'm surprised your rooting for them.
Don't tease me you know I've always liked the Rockets just not that much.
I remember you we're into the Wizards for quite a while.
I still like to watch the Wizards but I'm just not as strong of a fan for them anymore.
That's alright we all have favorites that fade in and out, it's not weird.
I'm just happy watching the Rockets do their thing, I'll get back to the Wizards eventually.
I understand I'm the same way with a few of these teams.
I'm really happy with the way Harden and Gordon have been working together.
That makes it easier when the team fits, I forget who's the Center these days do you know?
Right now it's Nene, I'm reasonably satisfied.
What do you think about the battle with the Warriors coming up?
I'm not worried I've never thought much of the Warriors this year it's all luck.
Luck can take you far in the NBA sometimes though.
Either way I'm looking forward to the Championship.
Me too, I was thinking about having a party at my house if you and the guys want to come watch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Boston, Cleveland game tonight?
Who've thought Boston had pep left without Thomas?
Yeah, I thought they were done.
Baker came out of nowhere tonight.
They all played well.
They did but Lebron had an off night.
Yeah and the Cavs were still witihin striking distance.
That doesn't bode well for the Celts.
Yea. You think the Warriors are gonna sweep?
I think so, no Kawahi no Spurs.
Yeah, he's a monster.
Took a while to get him going though.
You think Zha Zha did it on purpose?
I dunno, I've played defense like that and never got under anyone.
True, everyone is saying he's a big man but that big man could've taken a step in any direction.
Yeah, that really turned the tide of the whole game and series.
The playoffs have been pretty boing other than that though huh?
Yep, two horse race.
I guess we'll get to probably see Cavs versus Warriors part 3.
Should be pretty darn exciting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think off the playoffs so far?
It's been awesome so far.
Yeah I really love the Celtics.
I do to but I don't think they are going to win.
You don't, so who do you think is going to win?
The Cavaliers probably.
I think the Celtics will win.
Not me.
I know it went to 7 games with Washington but they will succeed against the Cavaliers.
Maybe
What do you think about the GSW and SAS game?
Oh GSW for sure.  They are already up 3 games
Yeah, you are probably right.
I know I am.
So what about the championship, predictions?
GSU
It's tough.  I really want the Celtics to win.
I think it will be GSU and Cleveland.
How many game will it go to?
7 for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite to win the finals this year?
I think the Cavaliers will win it all
Really???? I thought you would've been a Warriors fan.  Steph Curry is a beast
Yeah I agree, but I THINK Lebron is too much for them.
Between Curry, Green, and Thompson, the warriors are unstoppable.
Well, that's what alot of people said last year when the Warriors lost.
Yeah, but they didn't have Durant either.  He's going to be the game changer in this series.
Durant is a good addition, but I still think the Cavaliers will win.
I will definitely be a great series whoever wins, don't you agree?
Yes I agree.  If the Cavaliers win this year, Lebron will cement himself in history as one of the greats of all time.
That's true.  Lebron is the best player in the league right now and has been for awhile.
The crazy thing is that he's still got some good years left in him.
That's the advantage he had coming straight outta high school.
I still don't think he will ever be as good as Jordan though.
I don't know about that.  Lebron has already surpassed and broken many of Jordan's records.
But Michael Jordan was one-of-a-kind. Lebron never won a dunk competition, never got defensive player of the year, etc.
There are alot similarities between the two.  They are both astounding players .
Too bad Lebron never went to college. I would have loved to see him play for a college team
Yeah, it would've been nice to see Lebron win a NCAA championship or 2 or 3. lol
At least he has already won 3 NBA championships
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you think that anyone can beat Golden State in the playoffs.
Cleveland beat them last year, and San Antonio has a surprising strong team in the playoffs.
Who should get the MVP, Russell Westbrook or James Harden.
Even though neither player was enough to push their own team deep into the finals, Westbrook had a legendary regular season.
Will the NBA East continue to be weak versus the West?
As long as there are perennial big market, bad teams like the Knicks, 76ers, I think that's a yes.
Who is going to win this year's championship?
No doubt, it's time for the Warriors to take it back to Oakland, after losing the title last year.
Will anyone ever beat Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring record?
It's going to be tough!  If someone like Harden or Westbrook can play late into their 30s, it's possible.
Are there too many flagrant fouls in the NBA?
I don't think so; it's just that they're recording them as such now.
Will Golden State be able to stay dominent in the West for a long time?
I'm guessing no, since their top players will all want max contracts.
What do you think about advertising on jerseys, like Philadelphia wants to do?
Heck no, Philadelphia's ownership has pulled enough shenanigans in the last few years.
Who will be the surprise team in the east next year?
I think the Knicks have a chance to make the playoffs if they can get a good player for Carmelo Anthony.
Who will be the surprise team in the west next year?
No question, it's Phoenix, led by Devin Booker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will make the NBA finals this year?
I assume it will be Cleveland and Golden State again.
I heard that the same two teams have never met in the NBA finals three consecutive years.
That's pretty interesting. I didn't know that.
Yeah, but I agree with you. Those two are the best again this year.
I guess someone could get injured.
That's always a possibility.
But both teams have been blowing through the early rounds with no trouble at all.
Yeah, I've barely even watched their games because I knew they would be blowouts.
I wonder if the Spurs will give Golden State any trouble?
Well, they'll certainly be more of a challenge than Utah and Portland.
Yeah, those series were a joke.
San Antonio can never be counted out.
They're kind of like the Patriots of the NBA.
Right. Popovich is a lot like Belichick.
Yeah, he always finds a way to make things work for the team.
I really hope we get to see the Cavaliers and Warriors again though.
I know. That's the matchup I think most people want to see.
If everyone stays healthy we'll be seeing round 3 soon enough.
Let's hope so!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the match between Xavier and Arizona?

Goodin led the team with 6 assists.
Conversely, who was the assist leader for Arizona?
Cartwright led Arizona with 5 assists.

Xavier had 73 points and Arizona had 71 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that the playoffs are starting?
Already? Seems like this season by went so fast..
I'm kind of relieved since baseball is in full effect by now
I hear ya, i wish they wouldnt have the NHL playoffs at the same time as basketball.
Anyways I also think theres too many teams in the playoffs, its not even competitive til the conference finals most years.
I feel the same way, its pretty ridiculous to have almost 2 months of playoffs in a sport, even baseball doesn't seem as bad with it.
Who are you rooting for?
The Spurs...but theyll have a tough road...you know how the Cavs just march through the east each year without any competiton...
What about the Celtics?
They have no chance...I like their coach though
Still, I think they're off to a great start after tanking 3 years ago, and they have all th ose draft picks including #1.
Wow really?  That is crazy.
Its kind of crazy to think about the Lakers aren't in the playoffs again...i bet LA is pissed.
They have the Clippers though...
I meant like a real team.
Still they sucked for so long I'm glad to see them turning it around..but no shot for the next 10 or so years against the Warriors
Does anyone though?
Well the Spurs...
Lol anyways...
Come on they got this!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think is the most ridiculous shot made that didn't count?
Um... I don't know, There are a few.
What's your favorite? C'mon we all have it.
Ok,. Alright. there was this one, this dude throws it off his 3 point line clear across the court. and it makes it in.
Curry.
Yeah, yeah, Curry.
That didn't count and should've.
That was a ridiculous shot though.
What's another one?
Um, The one where Curry felt down on the ground and toss the ball up and it still went in.
Oh yeah. that was in the game against Houston. That was funny.
Yep. Total luck though.
Remember Belinelli's shot?
The one where he bounces it off backside of Morris.
Yeah.
That was sneaky. That shouldn't have counted.
Isaiah Thomas' hook shot from outside the court behind the backboard.
HAHA. that was messed up.
There was this one where this guy throws it too high and it bounces off the goal support bar on top but it still goes in.
i haven't seen that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Warriors last night?
No I missed the game was at work.
How much does a basketball weigh?
No idea, not that heavy though.
Do you like pick and roll basketball or a different offense.
I like the triangle offense that Jordan used to run.
What was the score in last nights game?
No idea, I was working out.
Do you think the league is soft?
I think the guys are younger so they're friendlier.
How many games have you attended this year.
I have been to 10 games this year.
Is watching basketball more fun than playing?
No, definitely not.
Where do you play basketball?
I play at the park on the weekends.
Where do you buy your basketballs from?
I go to the fitness store to buy them.
Do you have a basketball court at your house?
Not anymore, the old one broke.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think wins the Finals?
How about Golden State?
Well I think Cleveland has a great shot.
They have steamrolled through the playoffs thus far.
I think LeBron is on a whole new level.
What makes you say that?
Well he doesnt need motivation, right?
I got ya.
So when he gets snubbed for the MVP race what does that do?
Motivates him?
Exactly, now hes out to prove his worth.
I get what you're saying.
So I think that will almost ensure he wins and his team wins.
Will be interesting to see a third straight finals.
I think its great for the NBA
Why is that?
Rivalries benefit everyone
Do you think this will be the next one?
Its already looking like that.
This is true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see game 6 of Boston vs Washington?
Yea, it was exciting!
Yea, that  game winning shot by John Wall was intense.
You bet, I jumped out seat when he made it.
This has been the most exciting series so far during the playoffs.
I agree, most other series were sweeps or were not really close.
Who you routing for to win the next game?
I don't know. I kind of like Washington.
Yea, I think Washington is good too. They have some superstars.
Yea, I think so too. Boston is well balanced, but none of their players are elite.
Yes. Isaiah Thomas is good, but I don't think he can carry the whole team by himself.
They did get the number seed though for the season.
Ehh, I don't think it matters much. In the end I think Cleveland will go to the finals.
Hey, you never know. Washington and Boston did pretty well against the cavs during the regular season.
Yea, but regular season doesn't matter much. Playoffs is playoffs.
True. Lebron really stepped up his game during these playoffs.
Yes. I can picture him getting MVP. He is really dominating.
The addition of Kyle Korver during the season helped the cavs out a lot as well.
Yes, they've been crushing their opponents. The games weren't even close.
Yea. I guess I can see them going to the finals too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Houston Rockets last night?
Yes. it went into overtime with the Spurs winning on a block on James Harden by Manu Ginobili.
Do you know the extent of the injury Kawhi Leonard suffered during last night's Spurs - Rockets game?
He injured his ankle but he indicated he would play tomorrow
Who will be the first pick in this year's NBA draft?
Many think it will either be UCLA's Lonzo Ball or University of Washington's Markelle Fultz
So far, how many playoff games have the Cleveland Cavaliers lost this year?
They have not lost any. So far, they have won 8 in a row.
Who does Stephen Curry play for?
Stephen Curry plays for the Golden State Warriors.
How many NBA championships did the Chicago Bulls win in the 1990s?
They won six championships.
Who was the first superstar in the NBA?
Many consider George Mikan to be the first superstar when he played during the early 1950's for the Minneapolis Lakers,
What team drafted Tim Duncan and in what year?
The San Antonio Spurs drafted Tim Duncan in 1997.
How many NBA championships did the Houston Rockets win in the 1990s?
They won two championships.
Who was the greatest NBA basketball player?
Many people consider Michael Jordan to have been the greatest player in the NBA.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you bored of the NBA product?
I mean I like seeing dominance
So you dont mind seeing the same teams win?
Not at all, I can appreciate greatness
Well do you see that as bad for the league?
No it helps gravitate people to the game
Think itll be fun to see those teams go down?
Yes itll be nice to see the next generation.
Do you think it will be the Sixers
I would bet on them to be the next big thing
Will Brett Brown be coaching them?
Yes he is a very good coach
And who will there star be
I can see Embiid not being that guy
Because of his health?
Yeah he cannot stay healthy.
So then what do you think will be their star?
Simmons is going to light things up
I think itll be Saric
He will be good too just not as good as Ben
XXXXXXXXXXX
You see that Spurs game last night?
yeah, crazy, went to OT right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you been watching the NBA playoffs?
Yeah, I've watched some games here and there.
Yeah, same here. I also follow the games and stuff on NBA.com and ESPN.com
I should check those out.  Who do you like in the Finals?
In the East, it's gotta be Cleveland.
You're right.  LeBron is unstoppable.
Yeah, and Isaiah Thomas just was ruled out for the entire playoffs with an injury.
Oh man, I didn't hear that.  That's too bad.
Yeah, and I think it's the same thing in the West.  Golden State will go back to the finals.
Did someone else get injured?
Yeah, Kwhai Leanard has been injured ever since he was stepped on in game 1.
Oh man, that's not good.  He  is there best player.
For sure.  Ever since he went down the series has been pretty lopsided.
So it'll be rematch of last year's finals then.
Yeah, and the year before that, too.
Well, they are the best two teams out there.  It'll be a great finals
I was hoping that someone could knock down Golden State in the west.
Not this year.  Even though Steph Curry isn't playing as well as last year, they are still a really good team.
Do you know when the finals start?
I think it'll be about a week from now depending on how the conference finals go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cavs game last night?
No I missed it.
Man you should have seen Lebron.
What did he do?
He dominated like a super hero.
Haha ok
He played every position.
Did he bring the ball up the floor?
Yes he played as the point guard in the fourth quarter.
Wow what did that offense look like?
It was mostly him taking it one on one.
Every play?
Well sometimes he would draw more defenders and dish.
Wow that must have been fun to watch.
Yes I enjoyed it.
So the Cavs won?
Yes the Cavs won.
Wow who do they play next?
They play the Warriors.
I will make sure to watch that series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about the Rockets just giving up on the series?
Yeah thats embarassing
Bad enough the fans showed up late.
Put had no problem complaining.
That and they had a 7 man rotation.
That will kill you all day everyday.
I agree with you on that point.
You cant go in with a bench that shallow.
You also need to get guys around Harden.
I think hes got a great cast.
He did finish one of the best seaons ever but I dont know if he can keep doing that.
They refuse to play defense.
People want to be just like the Warriors.
Yeah but they play D.
I forgot about that.
How do you forget about Draymond Green?
Slipped my mind you could say.
Hes always like a defensive player of the year.
I dont know how I could forget
Hey youre getting old happens to us all
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest of all time in basketball?
I'm not sure, it's either Jordan, Kobe, or Lebron
Definitely, I agree.
Who do you think is the best though?
Maybe Lebron.
You think so?
Yeah, I think in the past few seasons, he's taken his game, and his career to another level.
Yeah.
It's incredible how much he's overcome since leaving the Cavs all those years ago.
Yeah, he was so hated for a while.
Also, the fact that he's just getting better.
What do you mean?
Like, he's becoming a better basketball player ever single season.
Yeah, I guess so.
Have you watched him? His sense of the game is just masterful now.
True.
It's crazy to think that he will continue to get better as he ages.
Yeah, I guess.
Not to mention that his athleticism seems to still be all there.
Yeah, he still can move like he used to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That's not as sad as flipping burgers at a local fast food joint for the rest of your life.
Nope. And it's actually a pretty good job. You might even be able to get Phys ed teacher certification and get paid twice. For the teaching and then for the coaching job.
I wonder how much that is.
Some make a lot more as a full fledged coach. Others get a teaching salary and a stipend as a coach. it all varies.
I wonder who the highest paid high school basketball coach is.
I know people who get paid more than 100K a year for coaching high school b-ball.
Who?
A guy named Kevin Boyle. Used to coach at St. Patrick High school. Got headhunted by a school in Florida.
Nice sunny weather vs Joisy. Hard to pass that up.
Yep, Yep. He's now making over 130K a year.
Yeah, but how many of these D-leaguers will make it as a high school coach to that extent?
Not many for sure.
Well. Maybe we should commercialize amateur sports in the US.
Um. no.
Why not?
Because Amateurs do it for the love of the game. They have to learn the love of the game first before they can love the money.
Everyone loves the money.
That's why we can't let commercialization of the amateur games at college/high school levels.
Colleges make so much money if you have a good football team, or even nationally ranked basketball teams.
But most of these amateur programs are money losers. Commercializing them won't help much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how about this first half?
Boston's doing a much better job tonight.
Yeah, only down by 12 right now.
How about that sweet 3-pointer by Cleveland before?
Yeah, that was nice.
I don't know how many fouls they've called, do you?
At least three I think.
Good, Boston just scored two more.
But Cleveland scored three more.
Ah, nice try, Boston.
Okay, they have possession again.
And they blew it with that air ball.
Brad Stevens does not look happy.
Well, he should be happier than he was last time.  At least the gap is only 13 points this time.
Good, the Celts are standing up for themselves to the ref.
Did he call a foul for backing into the one from the Cavs?
I hope not.  I think it was legit.
Everyone backs into each other at some point.
True, how else do you protect the ball?
Exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude Lebron James is the best player of all time.
No way, I think that is Michael Jordan.
Why?
Well, he is a great baller.
How come?
He can dunk.
But so can Lebron.
Well that doesn't matter.
Why not?
Because dunking is not everything.
Ok, well Lebron has a jump shot.
But so does Jordan.
But Lebron has years to play.
That is right, Jordan is done.
Well, do you still like Jordan?
Yes, he can dunk from the free throw line.
That is true but so can Lebron.
That is right, maybe I like him now.
Ok, I am glad I convinced you.
Thanks I love baseketball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about those Cavaliers?
Yeah theyve looked good. But its really LeBron and some other guys.
True, I dont think theyd win a game without him.
Look at what happened when he left.
He has to get bored of all this winning.
He wont ever top MJ so I am surprised he isnt enjoying his money.
He loves the game clearly.
We dont know that, money is a motivator.
He will never live to see half of what he got 8 years ago.
I think he will. They live lavishly.
Well they wont stop the Warriors.
You never know. Durant is small in big games.
Yeah but Green and Curry can hide that.
Yeah they dont need to be good at the same time.
LeBron probably retires after next year.
Or he could hang on like Kobe.
I think Kobe is the reason he goes out on top.
Not sure, he could sign with LA just to win a couple more.
If he isnt in the Finals every year he wont go to the team.
Thats outside circumstances that could effect that though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like watching basketball games on TV?
Yes.  I enjoy watching basketball games on TV.
Do you enjoy watching NBA games, college games, or both?
I enjoy watching NBA games more, but I like watching March Madness college games too.
Who are your favorite basketball commentators?
I like watching Charles Barkley, Shaq, and Kenny Smith comment on games.
Have you seen Shaqtin' a fool basketball bloopers?
Yes.  I think they are great and very funny basketball bloopers.
Do you think Charles Barkley is still one of the greatest players even though he never won a championship?
He was on the Dream Team and won a gold medal.  He played against Michael Jordan so it was hard for him to win a ring.
What do you think about Shaq?
I think Shaq was the most dominant big man in modern basketball.  The only way to stop him was to foul him.
Do you think the Lakers with Shaq and Kobe could have won more championships if they stayed together?
They probably could have won more championships if they could have stayed healthy and together.
Do you think Kobe or Lebron are better than Michael Jordan?
I think Kobe and Lebron are the best players of their era, but Michael Jordan is best player I have ever seen play the game.
How important do you think coaching is to the game of basketball?
I think it is important to have a good coach, but ultimately the talent of the team matters more?
Who do you think is a great coach?
I think Phil Jackson, Pat Riley, and Steve Kerr are great coaches.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Rockets get completely destroyed by the Spurs?
Don't remind me. I had money on Houston.
Ouch. Hope you didn't lose too much.
The Spurs didn't even have Kawhi or Parker. How could this happen?
Harden was getting shut down by Simmons. He looked lost out there.
And Murray. Where did that guy come from?
You know Pop's system. They put anyone in there and it just works.
But even a late first rounder?
Even Kawhi was a mid first rounder.
True. The Spurs are just a top tier orginization.
Ha! You should've bet on them then!
Can you not?
Who do you have tomorrow? Washington or Boston?
I don't even know. I guess Washington since the home team has won every game so far.
The Wizards players are just bad on the road. Especially Beal. But they thrive at home.
I can't believe he airballed that wide open shot to win the game in game 2.
Too much pressure. He's got it in him but that was a new situation for him. He'll learn.
I just hope it isn't another blowout. The whole play-offs has been filled with them.
You and me both. Hope it's a good, close, low scoring game.
Low scoring game in today's NBA? Yeah, right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats the west looking like in the NBA?
The usual. The teams youd expect to be there are and the ones that arnt, arnt.
Yea, what do you mean by that.
Exactly what i said.
Ok, can you be more specific. Like with team names and all?
Golden State is in the western conference finals and the Spurs are winning vs the Rockets.
Whats the score vs the Rockets?
3-2 Spurs
Do you think the Rockets have a chance?
Well the next games at home so perhaps, i doubt it though.
Has it been a good series so far?
Yea its been pretty good. game five went to overtime.
Oh, then its been really good, a coin toss really.
Yea, i guess so. Gonna be hard for Houston to win two games in a row though.
What was the score in the other series?
Which?
The one that golden state won.
Oh. They beat the jazz four to nothing.
Wow, looks like they are the team to beat.
I guess we will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see game 4 between the Rockets and Spurs?
Yes, the Spurs were blown out by 21 points.
Oh really, how did that happen?
The Rockets hit a lot of three pointers.
How many three pointers did the Rockets make?
The Rockets made 19 three pointers.
How many three pointers did the Spurs make?
The Spurs only made 7 three pointers.
Who was the leading scorer for the Rockets?
Harden led the team with 28 points.
Who was the leading scorer for the Spurs?
Simmons led the team with 17 points.
Who led the Rockets in assists?
Harden had 12 assists for the Rockets.
Who was the leading assist player for the Spurs?
Patty Mills led the Spurs with 5 assists.
How many turnovers did the Spurs have?
The Spurs committed 14 turnovers.
I see, so what was the final score?
The Rockets scored 125 points while the Spurs only managed 104 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Warriors game last night?
Yeah Draymond was absolutely ridiculous.
Well yeah but how about that fourth quarter by Durant?
That was so good.  I'm really glad he is over that leg injury.
Yeah. Hopefully he stays healthy all the way through the finals.
So you think they are a shoe in for the finals.
I mean yeah, who is going to stop them?
I thought maybe the Rockets.
Yeah I could see that but it doesn't even look like they are going to get past the Spurs at this point.
Yeah who would have thought that. I do not understand how the Spurs keep being good.
Yeah especially with that bum Aldrige being one of their "stars"
I don't think he is that bad.  I think he is just catching a lot of hate from everyone.
Yeah maybe.  Some games it feels like he just does not show up at all though.
I could see that.  He definitely is all over the place in terms of his performance.
Either way the West has been so much more fun to watch than the East.
Definitely.  I'm sick of Lebron just running through the East.
Yeah, I wish someone would challenge him.
No kidding.  I don't see the Wizards or Celtics having a real chance.
No way the Cavs will crush either of those teams.
So I guess we are headed for Warriors vs Cavs again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did the Celtics win last night?
Are you kidding me?!
Why, what?
The Cavs destroyed them.
Just in game 1?
No! Both game one and two.
Were the games close?
Ha! Not even.
How bad?
Cavs beat them by 40+ points in game 2
Oh my goodness. Is that some kind of record
Sure is. Largest margin of defeat
Wow. I wonder what all of the old Boston alum are thinking
Yeah, low point in Celtics history
Well they did make it to the conference finals
Yeah, I guess that's true
The Eastern conference is just not very good.
Yeah, only one dominant team - the Cavs
Could also be a bad matchup
Yeah, that's true...bad match up
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is in the NBA playoffs?
I think it's the Warriors and the Spurs.
Oh cool.  I'm not a fan of either team.
Yeah, me either but I enjoy watching basketball.
The game the other night was good I heard.
Yeah it was awesome.  Great shots, high scores.
Awesome.
Both teams are really talented.
Who is winning in the series?
I think the Warriors right now but it's anyone's game.
OK cool.  I used to watch the Bulls back in the day.
Oh yeah, Michael's hay day was awesome.
Him, Pippin, Armstrong and Rodman.  Classic.
They were great together, that's for sure.
I don't think that can ever be duplicated.
Well Kobe tried.
I suppose so.  I don't think it's the same.
Die hard Chicago fan?
Nah, not really.  I just marvel at MJ's talent.
Well there will never be another Michael Jordan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright, real talk, is Lebron James the best of all time?
No, Michael Jordan. His Airness is the best.
How can you say that with how lebron is dominating the east for the past 7 seasons already and counting.
Michael Jordan was doing that in the harder east.
Are you kidding me? Jordan had to it against one hard team and that was the Knicks.
Are you kidding me? The Pacers were really good then.
You're joking me. I can make the same arguement, the Pacers were really good now.
Yes, both those two teams were very good teams that should have won a ring, but that's besides the point, Lebron plays in a weaker east.
Well, Lebron does it all. He can pass, rebound and play defense. He also scores well.
Yeah, but Jordan was clutch. He shot 50% at end game situations. What does Lebron do ?
He sets his teammates up in good situations to succeed at the end of the game.
Yeah, but Jordan grabbed the ball and did everything. Everyone in the building knew it was going to him also.
This is just proving Lebron is more unselfish, you're taking my point and helping it succeed.
You're not getting it. Lebron shies away from pressure.
Jordan is a generic gambler and a terrible human being.
So we're going to go into their personal lives? Who cares, we're talking about basketball.
Well, it's true. Lebron is a better human being than Jordan.
Oh please, I dont want to continue this awful conversation.
I won. Lebron is the best.
Whatever man, Jordan was better at basketball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about the NBA lottery results the other night.
Yeah Boston, Lakers and Sixers wents 1, 2, & 3.
I had no doubt that the Celtics and Lakers would be 1 & 2.
Oh, did you think it would be fixed.
Well, it's hard to ignore that.
I guess, but they did have a good chance to be at the top.
Sucks for the Sixers because they would have gotten the Lakers pick if it was lower than #3.
True, but the Sixers did move up to #3.  And they get the Lakers pick next year.
Yeah, I guess but I think this draft will be a lot better.
It is a nice deep draft.
I'm guessing Fultz goes #1 to Celts, especially with Isaiah Thomas' injury this postseason.
Oh I have no doubt.  Will be a force for the Celts.
Then I guess the Lakers take Lonzo Ball, but I could see them passing.
Man, I wouldn't want to deal with the circus that is his dad.
Yep, the kid can ball but what a nightmare.
I'm not even sure how good he will be in the NBA.
Oh I think he will be pretty good.  He can distribute well.
But he's slow, long but slow.  I think he has trouble defending point gaurds.
Yeah, could be, you might be right.
Wouldn't surprise me to see the Lakers take Josh Jackson instead.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow Joe i was shocked we lost the game was so close it was almost unreal how close it was.
I know he narrowly made  those free shots.
If only he had made them the team would have won the game
Yeah he was like hitting the rim and they bounced off.
It was like cosmic magic or something did not want them to win
My thoughts exactly i was like sad.
I was sad too but you know what was good about it?
It was a close game like none i have seen recently.
Games so much lately have been boring
Most of the time yeah they are not interesting.
I find them to be rather on sided and it just bores me to tears
I know the other team has to put up a fight and score
Otherwise it just ends up one team scoring and just no impact you get what i mean
I get exactly what you mean it is horrible
Like i want to feel tense i want to be on the edge of my seat
Yeah that is the best feeling
Especially when you are in the crowd
Exactly! it is like a new life or something
I hope the next game turns out like this one did.
Me too it is rather fun when it is close.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Game 1 of the Spurs vs. Warriors series?
Yes, it was a great comeback by the Warriors.
Did you see when Kawhi Leonard got injured?
Yes, he landed on Pachulia's foot when he shot the ball.
I think it was intentional by Zaza Pachulia.
I don't know. He is just an awkward player.
The way he put out his foot looked weird to me.
He is big and lumbering so he needed an extra step to slow his momentum.
No, he was already landed.
Why would he want to do that intentionally, though?
The Spurs were winning and Leonard is their best player.
Sure, but that seems a bit farfetched.
Not in the playoffs. Players will do anything to win.
I don't think it matters. The Warriors may have lost that game, but they would win the series anyway.
That may be true. The team is stacked.
Exactly. The Spurs may have pushed them to six or seven games at best.
The Spurs just don't have the personnel.
That's why they went belly-up without Kawhi. They need another star player to compete.
Looks like they will end up getting swept now. Did you see game 2 and 3?
Yes. This series is over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you think the Men's NCAA tournament is to short?
March madness baby! Yeah, I think more teams should be added.
I agree, I know there is more than sixty teams to start. The NCAA should double the amount of teams that are allowed to enter.
This would prolong the tournament a little but I am confident the tournament could still be finished in March.
Yeah, currently only a few games left to play on the weekend towards the end of the tournament.
I know, I get bummed out when it is over.
Did you hear that Indiana University finally fired there head coach?
Yeah, I think he was there for about 6 or 7 seasons.
I love Indiana basket ball and Indiana University has not been the same since Miles Brand fired Coach Bobby Knight.
That is a fact. Bobby Knight might very well be the greatest coach to ever coach college basketball.
I agree. Do you remember when his temper got the best of him and he threw the chair across the basketball court?
How could I forget that? He got thrown out of the game for that antic.
He received a large fine. I can't remember the details but I think he was also suspended for a game or two?
I believe so. I can't remember either.
This new coach is suppose to be promising.
Yeah, I heard he is one the rare coaches to win five hundred games before he reached age fifty.
That is definitely a milestone.
The new coach could be on course to break some of the college coaching records.
Yes, I have heard only good things about the new coach. What was the new coaches name?
Shoot! I can't remember his name either. It is on the tip of my tongue.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see game 4 between the Cavs and Raptors?
Yes, the Raptors gave it their all but still fell short.
Who was the Raptors' leading scorer?
Ibaka led the team with 23 points.
Interesting, who led the Cavs' in scoring?
LeBron James scored a sizzling 35 points.
I'm not shocked by that. Who led the Raptors in assists?
The Raptors were led by Joseph with 12 assists.
Who was the Cavs' leading assist player?
Irving led the team with 9 assists.
Which player had the most rebounds for the Raptors?
PJ Tucker led the team with 12 rebounds.
Which Cavs' player got the most rebounds for that team?
James had the most rebounds with 9.
How many turnovers did the Raptors have?
The Raptors had 11 turnovers.
What about the Cavs? How many turnovers did they have?
The Cavs had 10 turnovers.
Okay, tell me the final score between the teams.
The Cavs won with 109 points while the Raptors only scored 102 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Clippers game the other day?
Yeah. Blake Griffin is looking hot!
You're funny. You never want to talk about the actual game.
What do you mean? I love the game!
Well, they were tied until the last minute. Wasn't that exciting?
Yeah, and Blake Griffin made the winning shot.
Again with that.
I just really enjoy his shooting skills.
He did make a bunch of baskets that game.
I know. I enjoyed the replays.
Because of the athleticism, right?
See, you get me.
I'm just really happy the Clippers are doing well this season.
Me too. They've only had a couple losses.
Do you want to get tickets to their next game?
I'd love that!
I thought you would.
I'll get to see Blake Griffin up close.
We'll get to cheer for our team up close!
That too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, I have a confession about my sudden basketball interest.
What is it?
The only reason I have suddenly become intrigued by basktball . . . is because of the manga/anime series Kuroko's Basketball.
Really? Is that the one with the boys with oddly colored hair?
Ha, that description could apply to a lot of anime. But yeah, it's a basketball anime featuring talented basketball athletes with goofy hair.
Well, what did you enjoy about basketball in the series?
I loved the guy who could always make three pointers and could even perfectly make shots from over half the court if he wasn't blocked.
Uh, that doesn't sound realistic -
Oh, and there was the person who could perfectly copy any other player's move as soon as he saw it.
How does that make any sense-
As well as my absolute favorite: the player who no one really notices and who uses misdirection to basically be invisible!
...I'm really not sure how that works. Does he at least look fairly typical so that kind of make sense?
No, he actually has blue hair.
How can people not notice someone with blue hair?!
I'm not too sure to be honest. I've been getting the sense that real basketball is not like this show.
Yeah, that almost sounds like superheros playing basketball as opposed to normal people.
You're probably right. I've also been missing the focus on emotional arcs in the real life basketball.
Er, why would that be featured?
There are also so many meaningful speeches in anime!
Maybe you should just stick to watching sports anime instead of actual sports then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards series?
Is that the series for the finals?
Yes.  The series is tied 2-2 now.
That's probably a good series.  Who's been playing the best so far?
Well, Isiah Thomas has been having some good games
I like Washington.  Wall is one of my favorite players.
It's been really physical.  Isiah had his teeth knocked out again.
I really would like Washington to win, though.  Celtics have been a dynasty long enough!
That's true, but they're a great franchise.  They deserve to start winning titles again.
Nah... Cleveland will win it all again.
Not if the Warriors have their way!
I tihnk the Warriors are overrated.  They'll cave to the Cavs again.
Well, at least we don't have to worry about Washington playing them.  They won't make it that far this year.
Well, neither will the Celtics!
OK, I'll give you that.  If Durant stays healthy, they may have a chance.
Nah.... I'm telling you.  Draymond Green will get thrown out of a few games again and it'll be the Cavs all over.
Well, I can't argue with that or be mad.  LeBron deserves all the titles he wants.
True.  He's definitely the best player.
Absolutely.  I wouldn't mind Cleveland winning again.
Me neither.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok Then who's the tallest player in the NBA currently?
That'd be Kristaps Porzingis at 7'3. Plays the Knicks
Who's the tallest ever?
That'd be two players. Manute Bol and Gheorghe Muresan. Both at 7'7
They probably have genetic diseases?
Not sure. Some of the really tall people generally have some kind of thyroid or growth hormone imbalances. Not sure if those two do also
Did you know that the tallest player in basketball doesn't play for the NBA?
Yes. Paul Stugess
How come he didn't get signed with the NBA?
He wasn't that good.
He's 7'8. He can reach the basket just standing.
Yep. Saw him dunk once. It was hilarious to watch
Doesn't even have to jump that high to dunk
Nor can he jump very high for that matter.
What do you mean?
Well, when human body reaches a certain height, things like jumping, running become difficult.
That's probably why they look so weird when they try.
Yep, awkward gait, and short vertical jump, because their bodies can't handle so much weight.
That's just like Football players. the linemen.
Yeah, really fat guys can't run even when they get the fumble and usually fall down because they can't coordinate their bodies well in running. Similar thing with the really tall basketball players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Boogie Cousins and Anthony Davis can co-exist?
Yeah I think they can. I think their games compliment each other
I agree with you on that one.
Cousins can play with his back to the basket a little better and Davis can do a little bit of everything.
Plus Cousins is not a bad 3 point shooter either
Yeah the guys is a phenomenal offensive player, he just has to keep his head on straight.
I think Davis is a good player for him because Davis is calm and can talk him off of the ledge
They just need some other pieces around these guys.
I like that they have Jrue Holiday, but they need some outside shooting.
Yeah if they can get some three point shooters they can open up the lanes more
For sure. This could be a dangerous team going forward
Yeah either that or this blows up in their face
I think these guys will play even better together next year
They are going to be an unstoppable force
I would love to see them make the playoffs next year
Yeah that has got to be their goal, but it's not going to be easy
It's all about their role players. They need a good core
Yeah they do. It can definitely work the fans may need to show some patience
Yeah I think the fans down their are pretty excited.
Yeah the Pelicans are definitely a team to watch out for.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Good.  You?
Good.  You a fan of basketball?
Yeah I love the NBA.
Cool, I'm a fan of college and NBA as well.
I guess I like college as well, but I like the pros more.
I think I like college more.
Why is that?
I feel like they have more to play for?
Really?
Yeah I think playing for a school when there is no money involved means more?
I guess, but I like watching the game at the highest level.
They might not be the best, but you can't beat the drama of the NCAA tournament.
I love watching the tournament, but not as much as the NBA finals.
I have to disagree.
That's okay.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for another Cavs Warriors finals?
I am. It's exciting but it makes the games leading up to the Finals really boring.
I know. There hasn't been a competitive series that has involved those teams.
It's great for the league to have two really good teams, but it makes the playoffs worse until the finals.
And it'll probably be the same next year. I can't see Lebron declining anytime soon.
The guy never gets injured and never loses any of his athleticism.
How old is he?
He's going to be 33 by next year. Most NBA players start slowing down after 30.
The most impressive thing about Lebron is his durability.
The fact that he came into the league at 19 and simply has not stopped producing.
He's a machine. People are saying he could play like this until he's 40.
I think he'll retire the moment he notices himself slowing down.
I agree. He won't be able to mentally handle not being the best in the world.
The guy has believed he's better than his peers since the age of 16. He's not going to accept a smaller role.
So when do you think he'll retire
In five years. Probably 38 or 39.
That's it? We both agree he'll be every bit as good next year.
Yeah but he'll want to retire while he's on top.
Do you think we'll view Lebron as the greatest player ever.
It depends on these next five years. If he wins 2 more championships, I believe we have to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So sad that the Pistons didn't make the playoffs last season.
Yeah really.  They used to be such a good team.  I mean they are supposed to still be a good team!
Yeah, at least they say they are.  The fact that they couldn't even make the playoffs was just so substandard.
Exactly, I expected better.
That was so awesome when the had some really good players like Joe Dumars back in the 80s.
Yep, that was the pinnacle of it back then.
Though you've got to give the Rasheed Wallace era of the 2000s a fair shake too.
Yeah, he was a great player but he could have handled himself better.
He was a bit of a character, always getting into arguments with referees.
Yeah, he was sort of the John McEnroe of basketball.
Yeah, haha!  That's a good one.
But there was no doubt about his talent or how good of a player he was.
I can't wait to see the new stadium downtown, that is going to be so cool.
Now that you mention it, I was thinking about that the other day!
Big time development downtown, with the new stadium and all the other stuff.
Yeah, finally they get it right and give people a reason to come to Detroit itself, instead of the suburbs!
Now the team just has to be good enough to be worthy of the new stadium, heheh.
Well Tom Gores is a multi billionaire, so if he puts his money to good use, we should have a good team.
Yeah that guy is so cool.  He's a jewish guy from Israel,, did you know that?
Yeah, I think I heard that.  Anyway, he's got to spend some of that money on the team now that we're getting a new stadium.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Golden State, Spurs game last night
Yeah, the Spurs don't have a chance
I know, even with Lenoard, they probably would have only won one game.
I know, and without him they probably will get swept.
What about Cleveland the other night
They looked awesome against the Celtics
Lebron is the fucking man
I know, 14 years into the league and he is better than ever
The man is ridiculous
I know, he is probably one of the 5 best players ever.
As good as they played, do you think they can beat the Warriors.
I don't know, if they keep playing like that, they have a good chance.
The Warriors just have so much talent.
With Curry, Green, Thompson, and Durant, they are amazing.
Cleveland will have to play better than ever to beat them.
Lebron, Irving, and Love and going to have to play out of their mind.
It could be one of the best series ever.
I know, it will be a hell of a series.
I can't wait to see it.
Me to, I will watch every game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you watch Game 5 of the Spurs and Rockets?
Yea the game was pretty crazy
I was shocked that a 39 year old Ginobli could turn back the hands of time
Yep, he was the x factor in that 4th quater
The Spurs really played amazing basketball in that game
So who do you think is going to win the series?
I see this going to a game 7, simply because the two teams are so evenly matched.
I agree,  I see the rockets winning Game 6 and it going to 7
The Spurs will beat the Rockets in Game 7
I think the better coaching will prevail, coach Pop has excellent pedigree
D'Antoni preaches no defense, so that is not going to carry the team very far
Defense is the way to the Championship
As much as Golden State has amazing fire power, they are also a good defensive team.
The same can be said about the Cavs, as they have picked it up during the playoffs.
With that defense, I can easily see those 2 teams back in the finals.
Noone is beating the Cavs in the East, but if San Antonio beat the Rockets, I can see them challenging the Warriors.
It is going to be an brutal series for both teams, but I can see the Warriors pulling it out.
I like the Spurs over them
The Warriors have way too much firepower, they will come out on top
Spurs in 6
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you caught any good basketball games lately?
Yeah, I just watched the Duke versus KU game last night. Did you watch?
No, I didn't get to. What happened?
Well it was a great game! Duke ended up winning in double overtime.
Oh man, I wish I would have seen that! They have a stellar recruiting class this year, so I bet they will be great again next year.
Of course, they always do. But KU's recruits are not to shabby either.
They need some good new post players.
I think they recruited two or three big men that really have some good post moves.
Who does Duke play next?
I think they have a home matchup with North Carolina.
That ought to be a good one. I love rivalry games.
I think KU is playing Kansas State which is their rival next.
That should be an easy win for KU.
Maybe, sometimes K-State's team can really show up and be good.
True. Who do you think will win between Duke and UNC?
That is anyone's guess. I will be pulling for my Blue Devils.
Of course you will, though I would really love to see a little bit of an upset with UNC winning.
We shall see. The game is at 8 o'clock Thursday.
Ought to be a good game
Yes, I love a good ball game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The biggest joke of a franchise has got to be the Knicks.
Yeah Phil Jackson hasn't earned any of that big money he is receiving.
What an absolutely embarrassing time to be a Knicks fan.
They have totally disrespected Carmelo Anthony. Though he has brought some of this on himself.
How can you say that? The guy is doing all he can!
No I don't think so. I think Carmelo is a team killer. He has to share in this blame.
Carmelo is a scorer that's what he does. He has done his part.
What about the other areas of basketball? Defense, rebounding, team leadership? He's failed in all of those categories!
I agree he has come up short in those areas.
And those are large areas. Carmelo is not someone you can build a team around
Maybe. But I like to see him around a different supporting cast..
I think you would see the same result
Maybe. Maybe not. I think Carmelo has been dogged so much about Phil Jackson that he's been tainted.
I agree Phil did do some damage, but Melo didn't have the best reputation before.
Well they drafted Porzingis who seems like a keeper. They probably want to build around him.
I'm sure that's the plan going forward
I definitely think Carmelo needs to move on
Yeah he needs to see if he can go to a team and win a championship
Yeah I think it's not or never for him
Me too. He is not getting any younger
XXXXXXXXXXX
How crazy was that Celtics beatdown?
It was just nuts, truly, nuts
LeBron is amazing, and cruel
With Isiah out, the Celtics are done
Pretty much. They just don't have The Guy to stand up to superteams
This is what the Raptors and Hawks found out over the years
I think a well rounded team can win the title, just not against a Lebron team
The Pistons title team might have been able but I wouldn't favor them
The nice thing is that the Celtics have a ton of options to improve
Question is, would Gordon Hayward get them over the hump?
I just don't know, it comes down to fit. Al Horford hasn't been what they paid for
This is why I think Fultz is the best option
He is the one guy that looks like a superstar in the draft
Draft Fultz, and keep the status quo so he grows in a good environment
Agreed. Okay, so how do you see Warriors/Cavs 3?
The Cavs have to slow it down again, Lebron has to be amazing
Really, the Warriors have this as long as they are healthy
Which can always be a big if. Steph and Durant have had their share of injuries
I'm going with Warriors in 6. Cavs will have a crazy game from Kyrie that steals a game, and the Warriors will have one off game
Sounds about right to me. I'm pumped for the offseason, will another superteam emerge
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe the Bucks almost took the Raptors to game 7?
Yeah! They really showed a lot of good signs for the future.
What do you think they need to do in the off-season?
I think they need to get a dynamic guard in the draft, like that kid from Louisville, Donavon Mitchell.
Yeah, that would be nice. I think they also need to draft that Thornwell kid from South Carolina in the 2nd round.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the 76ers last night?
Yes, did you?
Yes, it was a great game.
Who won last night?
The 76er's won.
They sure have some great players.
Yes they do.  They are amazing.
Who is your favorite player?
My favorite player already retired.  He was Michael Jordan.
Yeah, I loved him.
How are the 76ers doing today?
They are in 2nd place and strong.
That's great.  They are my favorite team.
Mine too.
Have have you seen them in person?
Yes, a few times.
They are so fun to watch in person.
I bet.  Are the seats expensive.
Yes, they are expensive but have a great view.
I would love to go some day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Milwaukee bucks are a team on the rise
Yeah they have a good coach in Jason Kidd and the Greek Freak is the real deal
This kid can do everything! pass, block, score et cetera
He may be the best player in the league one day
And that day might not be that far off
Yeah you are right. He just needs some help
Yeah, I do like Middleton and Monroe
Yeah they are good pieces. They just need to continue to build
They are going to be a fun team to watch in the upcoming years
I definitely will be keeping an eye on them
Plus they play in the weak Eastern Conference they should be able to gain on the other teams
All of the team not named the Cavaliers.
Yeah you are right about that. Maybe they can move up to the 3rd or 4th seed.
That would be a huge improvement from last year
It's great to see an organization going in the right direction
Yeah it is. They just have to make the right moves going forward
Just don't lose the Greek Freak and everything will be alright.
Exactly. He will keep butts in the seat in Milwaukee
Yeah he has got that city excited again about basketball
I'm excited just watching these guys play
XXXXXXXXXXX
hi there...have you been watching these NBA playoffs?
i've seen quite a few of the games,especially the celtics games since i'm such a big fan of theirs.
Oh.  I'm a Knicks fan so, as usual, they are not in the playoffs.
Wow! A knicks fan! i give you credit for admitting you root for those guys.
LOL, yes, they are a bunch of losers, i must admit, but i've been rooting for them for many years and i can't switch now.
before we talk about the playoffs, i've often wondered...how can a team with the money and resources that the knicks offer have so many bad seasons?
that's a very good question.  i put a lot of the blame on owner james dolan, but at this point, phil jackson has to also be held accountable.
i agree. jackson did a great job in chicago and los angeles, but he was coach then, not executive.  and he had superstars in both places.
that's right.  jackson has never been a team president until now.  it's obvious it was going to take quite a while to turn the knicks around, but the lack of progress is discouraging.
on to the playoffs, i am disappointed in how my celtics have played against cleveland, but just between you and me, i'm not surprised.  i felt going in that cleveland is the better team, by a wide margin.
and now the series shifts to cleveland so it's obvious that they pretty much have the series in the bag.
yes; i'm going to have to settle for knowing that the celtics had the best record in the conference in the regular season; but as far as the playoffs, they don't appear to be anywhere in the class of the cavs.
and how about those golden state warriors? after their heartbreaking loss in the finals last season, i'm sure they are highly motivated to get revenge on cleveland this time around.
no doubt.   i think the finals, when they start in about a week, will be, maybe, the most highly watched finals ever because of the rivalry that has developed between Golden State and the cavs.
am i right that this will be the third straight year they have been in the finals?
correct.  i wonder if that has ever happened before.
well, i happened to mention i've rooted for the knicks for many years.  i'll tell you right now that i'm 65 years old.  i'm not quite old enough to remember, but i do know that the knicks and the old minneapolis Lakers met for 3 straight years in the finals in the early/mid 1950s.
wow! i didn't know that.  did the knicks win any of the 3?
none of them  new york's 1970 and 1973 teams are the only titles they have won.
oh, the teams with reed, frazier, and debusschere.  well nice talking to you and for your own sake, consider rooting for another team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am sick of Isiah Thomas.
I agree.
He gets superstar calls for no reason.
I mean his offense is fun so I am sure the NBA is slightly encouraging it.
I really hope you are wrong but it does seem he is getting lots of calls lately.
Yeah I feel bad for him too.
Yeah that stuff with his sister was terrible.
Exactly, and he still is carrying his team all alone.
What are you trying to say about Kelly Olynik?
That he is terrible at basketball.
I agree.  Plus he is dirty as could be.
Yeah he clearly is out there injuring people.
Or at least trying to.
Yeah, I wonder why the league has not done anything about it.
Probably since it is impossible to prove.
Well they could watch what he is doing out there. It is definitely dangerous.
Yeah but all players do stuff like that and it just looks like basketball.
If you aren't paying attention I could see that.
Well maybe they have said something to the Celtics.
Hopefully, also hopefully they tell him to fix his hair.  Its terrible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So it looks like we will all finally get to see the Warriors vs. Cavaliers in the finals.
I know, Seems as though we have been waiting forever!
It's obvious those were to two best teams in the league this year hands down.
Yeah, I've been quite disappointed with the rest of the playoffs up to this point, blow out after blow out!
That's true, but at least we have an amazing NBA finals to look forward to.
No doubt about it, who do you have eventually coming out on top?
I am really torn on this one; both teams have been dominant this post season.
To me, the Cavaliers have been by far the most impressive team in the entire NBA playoffs.
That's hard to argue especially since it is looking as though they will go into the finals undefeated.
Actually, it is looking more and more like we will have two undefeated teams for the first time ever in NBA history.
I am excited to see how LeBron handles the Big Four from Golden State.
Yea me to, but Kyrie Irving will play a major factor if the Cavs are to come out on top.
Even though this is LeBron's seventh straight finals, I feel this will be his most challenging one yet.
I'm with you there, the Warriors might just have too much fire power.
Kevin Durant went down once to Lebron in the finals, I have a feeling he is going to play very well.
Yeah, but that time he did not have the Splash Brothers to help him out.
Yeah, Curry and Thompson will make things a lot easier for Durant this time around.
True, the will for sure and we have yet to factor in Draymond Green.
Ultimately, I am inclined to believe that the Warriors will get their second championship in the past three years.
I disagree, the Cavs are just too dominant right now, I think LeBron goes back to back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
are u excited for the cleveland game tonight?
ehh, yes and no
Lebron seems to be unstoppable though right?
well, that's just it, is he really unstoppable athletically or just a cash cow?
does it matter if you watch the whole series anyway?
i suppose for some, though i do not, nor do i know of anyone watching every game of the series
how much fun would it be to not have all the hype and irrelevant branding and money references though?
actually, all sports not just basketball suffer from having no focus on actual sport and competition
exactly, which is why it's cool to tune in and what & who is cool in the nba whilst keeping up with playoffs as well; right?
how much have you made for being a loyal cleveland playoff 'theoretical' supporter?
huh, what do you mean how much have i made, like personally?
yes, your actual personal monetary benefit from so called 'support' of the cavaliers?
i don't understand what you mean, how do i make money watching someone else do something?
exactly, go and do for yourself;  even if that means going to play basketball yourself to at least reap the physical benefits
but then what kind of cleveland fan am i, and how would i know of Lebron's highlights?
case and point ignorant one, professional teams do not exist without your wasted money and time on them;  yet sports are still always here for us to enjoy and actually benefit from
so i don't get it, why is there even an nba.    .or any other league for that matter?
exactly, and furthermore why would you use time you could be experiencing a sport and begin fit, on watching anyone else?
well then what is there to talk about if not all the playoffs going on?
perhaps EVERYTHiNG else in the world that has relevance, not a price
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched The Wizards this year?
Yes I have.
They have got a lot better!
Yes!  And the record shows it.
Do you think they could have beat Boston in the second round?
Yes I do.
I think that they just did not have quite enough fire power.
That, and the fact that Boston seemed to have a different guy get hot every game.
I thought Isaha Thomas was going to win it all by himself after that 50 point game.
Really! They could not stop him.
No they could not.
They did keep his points down after that game.
Yes they did but; It made it hard for them to gaurd other guys with some much put on gaurding him.
That is true.
They did not have a cjoice though.
That is right, left alone he would have shot the lights out every game.
He did pretty well anyway!
Yep! You cannot totally stop him.
Did you see that Boston got the first pick in the draft next year.
I did..that sucks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been paying attention to the NBA finals this year?
Yeah, but not constantly. I've mostly been watching on and off.
Yeah, me too. I don't really have a team in the playoffs, but it's still pretty entertaining and I pay attention sporadically.
Yeah, my team was in the playoffs, but they lost in the first round.
It happens. It makes it hard to get interested when your team isn't all that great.
Agreed. Which teams do you think will play in the championship series?
Probably Cleveland and Golden State, same as the past two years.
Yeah, that's who I think will make it. Which team do you think will win.
Probably the Golden State Warriors. The Cleveland Cavs are good too, but Golden State seems pretty unstoppable.
Yeah, I think the Warriors will win as well.
I kind of saw that coming, even before the season began.
Yeah same, it's kind of unfortunate that the NBA seems to be a little too predictable.
Yeah, going into the season, there's only like 4-5 teams that even I have a chance to win it all.
Yeah, I agree. There's 32 teams I think, but only a few have a legitimate chance to win it all.
Yeah, and it's hard to get into NBA basketball if your team isn't one of those 4-5 teams that has a chance to win it all.
My team had kind of a chance, but I figured they'd lose in the first round or two, so I wasn't super disappointed or surprised when they got bounced out in the first round.
Yeah, oh well, there's not much you can do. The Warriors are ridiculously good and the Cavs are good too.
Yeah, plus the Cavs have an easier path to the finals since the eastern conference isn't as stacked/talented as the western conference.
I think the Warriors will win, but I kinda want LeBron to get more rings.
I don't know, I don't really care either way. I just want to see a good finals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last Spurs game against the Warriors?
Yeah I did, do you think that the Spurs are going to go on to the next round?
I really hope so, the Spurs are my team but it seems like they can never beat the warriors!
Yeah I know it, especially since Tony Parker is out for the rest of the playoffs.
Last year in the playoffs the Spurs put up a good fight but they just couldn't get past those warriors
Last year they had Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing in the playoffs and they couldnt beat the warriors.
I was at work last night so I couldnt catch that game, was Kawai in the game?
No he didnt play, hes still out, I even heard that hell be out for this whole round in the playoffs!
What, they are going to keep him out for that long!
Thats what I read this morning, I guess ankle injuries are pretty serious so it would be easy to do further damage if he plays too soon.
Oh my gosh thats terrible! What are they going to do without Tony and Kawai?
So I guess you didnt hear about David Lee either?
No I didn't what happened to Lee?
Well he fell in the first quarter and injured his knee, it looks like he will be out for a while too!
So this means we have lost to the Warriors three times in a row, if we lose one more time we are out of the finals!
Thats right, and the past two games they've beat us pretty bad, 100-136 and 108-120.
The first game wasn't so bad, I think we only lost by two points.
Your right but we had Kawai was in that first game up until the third quarter.
I read that Zaza Pachulia from the warriors purposefully slid his foot under Kawais foot to make him fall and injure him.
I heard the same thing too but I hope that its not true, talk about bad karma!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man did you catch how good Lebron was last night?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the warriors and the cavs last night?
Yes I sure did it was a barn burner.
It was back and forth every quarter
Yeah I know I didn't know who was going to pull it out.
Yeah lebron went off i think he had 42 points.
Yeah he did Curry's 38 wasnt enough to push the warriors over the top
Lebron is just unreal he took over that fourth quarter
Yeah he did, thompson hit that three to tie it up with a minute left I thought they had a chance.
I know right
Its hard to stop erving, love and james just too much there
Yeah these two teams are just to loaded makes for great games
Everytime they play its a nail bitter
James has to be the greatest right now it just takes over
Yeah when he hit that jumper with 15 sec left put them up 4 was just amazing.
Its still hard to count curry out but just wasnt enough.
Yeah I cant wait to watch them play again
Me either its always great
One of these teams will win the trophy again for sure
Yes i cant wait for that finals again
Definitley have to get your popcorn ready
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Durant's move to Golden State
I think it's one of the weakest moves I have ever seen
Yeah, you know it's bad when I agree with Stephen A. Smith
My thoughts exactly. He could have went anywhere else.
And then to go to the team that you should have beaten last year!
The team that won 73 games without you!
Yeah, I don't recall a player ever doing something like that before
Me neither. I mean guys have played with other superstars, but not like this
Yeah this was a trash move and professionally I have lost some respect for him.
Yeah me too. I think this was a move just so he can say that he was a champion.
Yeah I think he was scared that he would never get a championship in his career
Yeah. Very weak on his part. He could have carved a legacy had he won with the thunder
In golden state he's just a piece of the puzzle
I definitely feel like this move is showing a character flaw for Durant
Even if he had went somewhere else, I would have been cool with it.
Yeah me too. Just not the team that didn't need you anyway
He will probably get this ring, but it will be tainted
Absolutely. Most people will not forget this.
This takes away from his legacy not add to it.
Someone should have told him that before he signed on the dotted line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know a lot about basketball?
Yeah but not the NBA
What do you watch then?
Usually college basketball
Do you have a favorite team?
Yeah, I am a huge fan of BYU
That team is not very good!
We don't win many championships, true, but we are still good!
I like UCLA, because we win a lot of championships.
That's not the only reason to like a team though!
Why not?
You should like the school, the players, the coach, etc
I don't know anything about the players anymore but I used to!
Why do you say that?
I like them because I went to UCLA! I dont know anything anymore though
Oh I see. So that's why you like them so much!
Yeah, I used to even have classes with the players, so that was cool.
Awesome! I like BYU because I know Jimmer!
Who is that?
He was a great player a couple years ago, he could hit really long 3 pointers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch teh game between the Warriors and Spurs last night?
Yeah I did, now they are down 3-0 right?
Yeah, its crazy they were up 25 in the first game then blew the lead.
Losing Kahwi hurt them.
You can say that again, now they are probably going to get swept.
It looks like the Celtics are going to also.
Yeah Cleveland has dominated them so far as well.
Its crazy that neither one of those teams have lost yet in the playoffs.
Yeah the Lakers are the only other team to start off the playoffs 11-0.
I hope both of them end up 12-0 when the finals start.
Its going to be a great finals if both of those teams make it.
The 3rd straight year of it being Cleveland and Golden state.
Last year's series was epic.
Yeah when Kyrie hit that shot I lost my mind.
So did I, I couldn't believe Cleveland came back from the 3-1 Deficit to win that series.
Neither could cleveland, that town went crazy.
I'm such a big Lebron fan after coming back home and winning a title there.
Yeah I dont know why everyone hates him so much.
Its because they are all old and Jordan fans.
I think Lebron is better to be honest, just never had the Hall of Fame teammates like he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Celtics and Wizards last night?
Yeah, what a game.  Cant believe that the Wizards one.
I know, That was a hell of a shot by John Wall
He has had an awesome season.
Do you think the Wizards can beat the Celtics at home in game six.
They have a chance, but it's going to be hard.
I know, the Celtics are strong at home
The Wizards are going to have to play great defense to have a chance.
Do you think however wins has a chance against Cleveland
To be honest, not really.  Cleveland is just to good
As long as they have Lebron, I don't think anyone in the east can beat them.
I know, Lebron is just to damn good.  He is amazing.
He should be slowing down in the next 2-3 year.
Yeah, then maybe the other teams will have a chance.
Do you think that Cleveland can beat Golden State
I do, but it's going to be hard.
I know, it should be a hell of a series.
With Durant, Curry, Thompson, and Green, i'm not sure anyone can beat them in a 7 game series.
I know, it's like they have their own all star team.
Yep, it should be fun to watch no matter who wins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does the NBA want to change the draft lottery process?
Why do they need to?
I think its unfair the worst team doesnt get the best pick.
I think its to discourage tanking.
Well theres 2 counters to that.
And they are?
One is the Sixers. They have tanked for years
And have only gotten the first pick once
But are always getting top 3 picks.
Ok and whats next
Other leagues do not have to worry about tanking  without having a lottery.
Yeah but I think its easier to do in basketball.
I think the NBA is ripe for tanking to be honest.
So you agree with me?
I just think there is not enough talent in NCAA for the entire NBA to take every year.
Then maybe they should revisit eligibility.
I think we are getting closer to that happening.
Silver will not be able to pass much though.
The NCAA has no word on whether to do that.
They all collude together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you wanna go see that basket ball game?
Bruh that is vague question, which game?
The Atlanta Hawks game!
Oh sure who they playing?
I think the Celtics.
Oh cool I haven't seen THEM play
What do you mean THEM
I ment the Celtics, dummy
Ah ok, cool! You free for it saturday?
Let me check my schedule
It's going to be this saturday, btw
Yeah I should be free
When you want me to come pick you up
When's it start?
I think around 5
Ok cool, well it's a 2 hour drive, want to leave at 1?
Heck yeah man, wanna get food before the game?
Sure dude, where at?
How about buffalo wild wings?
I'm down for that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you know why the Celtics are wearing black bands on their jerseys?
It's for Isaiah Thomas's sister.  She died not too long ago.
He's had no luck lately, has he?
Right?  And out for the rest of the series.
Nice try at a 3-pointer there, Cavs.
Okay, Boston, try passing again.
There we go.  Nice layup, Crowder.
And another try at a 3-pointer for the Cavs.
No luck.  Boston gets it back.
Good.  I hate to say but I have to root for the underdog here.
Nice job, Boston!  Another 3-pointer.
They're fighting again.  Good.  They need to.
Absolutely.  The Cavs are great, but sometimes you want someone else to win.
Nice pass behind the back by Bradley.
Yep, he's got his fighting spirit back.
And Cleveland gets one point for the foul.
And two points, now.
Brown got a little too handsy with James there.
Yep, and now the Celtics are paying for that again.
38-51?  Well, at least it's only 13 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win MVP this year?
It's got to be Westbrook.
I agree. I never thought I'd see a player average a triple double.
Let alone a point guard.
It'll be a crime if he doesn't win.
But his team wasn't as good as other teams.
That's the only argument Harden has. His team was better. And he didn't have much help.
But his season wasn't historic. And he wasn't the best player in the league this year.
His team's record would argue otherwise.
It was a great year for many athletes. You could make a case for Lebron or Kawhi. But all are second to Westbrook.
I think Kawhi should get votes because of his defense. None of the other guys care about defense.
Yeah, from a true fan's perspective, we should award guys that at least try on defense.
Westbrook doesn't try.
I know. He spends all his energy on offense.
It's a shame because Westbrook should be really good at defense.
Anyone with athleticism should be good. It's all about effort.
I hate knowing that some players don't put out 100% effort on the court.
That's why I'd never vote for Lebron.
He doesn't start trying until the playoffs.
But once the playoffs start, there's nobody better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DID YOU WATCH THE SPURS AND WARRIORS GAME TODAY?
NO UNFORTUNATELY NOT I HAD TO WORK BUT HOW WAS IT?
IT WAS THE GREATEST COMEBACK EVER IN AN NBA GAME?
IN WHAT SENSE WAS IT THE GREATEST COMEBACK?
WELL THE WARRIORS ON THEIR HOMECOURT WERE DOWN BY AT LEAST 28 POINTS LATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND STILL CAME BACK TO WIN.
WOW TOO BAD I MISSED THE GAME. WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED?
THE GAME TURNED AROUND IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHEN THE SPURS BEST PLAYER LEONARD TWISTED HIS ANKLE.
DID HE GET HURT BADLY?
YEP HE DID NOT PLAY THE REST OF THE GAME AND THE WARRIORS WENT ON A HOT STREAK AND SCORED 20 STRAIGHT POINTS.
WOW SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT COMEBACK FOR THE WARRIORS.
YES IT SURE WAS AND THAT CURRY DUDE KEPT DRAINING THE THREES.
YEP CURRY IS A GREAT PLAYER AND SO IS DURRANT.
IT BASICALLY CAME DOWN TO THE WIRE AND WAS SO EXCITING INDEED.
NOW I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT SERIES MATCH UP.
YEP TWO OF THE BEST TEAMS IN THE WESTERN CONFERENCE WILL NOT FAIL TO ENTERTAIN.
HAHA THAT'S FOR SURE ANY GAME WITH THE WARRIORS IS ALWAYS HIGH SPEED.
WELL NEXT TIME COME OVER TO THE HOUSE AND WATCH ON MY BIG SCREEN.
HAHA NOW THAT'S A FOR SURE HAHA
OK I WILL GET THE BEER COLD FOR THE GAME.
COOL REMEMBER I ONLY DRINK THE GOOD STUFF HAHA. OK SEE YOU FRIEND AT THE NEXT SERIES GAME.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the championship game between Gonzaga and North Carolina?
Yes, both teams shot the ball poorly.
Yea, it was a weird game for both teams.
Gonzaga only hit 33% of their shots.
Also, North Carolina only hit 35% of their shots.
Exactly, Carolina also only hit 14% of their 3 pointers.
How did they win this game shooting so poorly?
They played smart by not turning the ball over.
Oh really, I didn't realize that.
It's true. North Carolina only had 4 turnovers.
How many turnovers did Gonzaga have?
They had 14 turnovers.
Do you know how many rebounds Carolina had?
They grabbed 46 rebounds.
Okay, what about Gonzaga?
They had 49 rebounds.
Who lead the team in scoring for North Carolina and Gonzaga?
Joel Berry for Carolina and Williams-Goss for Gonzaga.
I see, so it looks like it came down to the turnovers.
Exactly, the low turnovers helped Carolina and hurt Gonzaga.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the Playoffs this year?
Yeah, it's kind of boring though.
I thought it was just me!
It will end up being Cleveland v Golden State again I think.
Me too. Do you think they'll both sweep?
It's probable. Which is crazy, and unexciting to watch.
Rounds 1 and 2 had some great games, though.
Yeah, the Spurs/Memphis series was really great.
I just can't remember the last time it was this anticlimactic.
Last year was at least exciting because it was Curry v Lebron for the first time.
Yeah, this just feels like a repeat of last year.
I think Golden State might win it though.
Maybe. LeBron is still playing like he's in his 20s though.
Yeah, he's really on a mission to win it again this year.
Will you watch the NBA Awards?
Just to see who wins MVP, I think.
I don't like that they're waiting to announce the winner.
Me neither, it's better when it's just their team there.
You think Westbrook will win?
Yeah, and he deserves to win too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between Purdue and Kansas?
Yes, Kansas destroyed Purdue.
Really, I figured Purdue would at least be more competitive.
They were in the first half, but they fell apart in the second half.
Who led Purdue in scoring?
Swanigan led Purdue with 18 points.
Who was Kansas' leading scorer?
Mason and Graham each scored 26 points for Kansas.
Wow, how did that happen?
Both players hit many three pointers.
I see. Who led Purdue in rebounding?
Swanigan was able to get 7 rebounds for Purdue.
Okay, who was Kansas' leading rebounder?
Jackson had 12 rebounds for Kansas.
Who led Purdue in assists?
Mathias had 7 assists for Purdue.
Which team had the higher field goal percentage?
Kansas had the higher field goal percentage with 55%
Okay, can you tell me the final score?
Purdue only scored 66 points while Kansas scored 98 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Michael Jordan?
He is the greatest player of all-time. Did you ever see him play?
Yes, I saw him play for the Chicago Bulls. He was amazing.
Do you remember who some of his teammates were?
Yes, there was Scottie Pippen.
He played with Horace Grant as well. Do you remember who coached the Bulls?
Yes, they were coached by Phil Jackson. They had an amazing playing style, didn't they?
Yes, they would pass the ball to Jordan, and he would do his thing. Such a great player.
He had this fadeaway shot that no one could stop. He would just post-up and then fade-away.
Did you see Jordan play for the Washington Wizards?
Yes, I remember that!
He wasn't quite as good as he was for the Bulls, but he still had some of his game.
What is Jordan up to these days?
He is a part-owner of the Charlotte Hornets, I think?
Yes, I think so as well. Why does he work with the Hornets?
I think that is where he grew up.
That's right! He grew up in the Wilmington, NC area.
Didn't he go to school in North Carolina as well?
Yes, Michael Jordan played at the University of North Carolina.
A Tarheel! What a great player he was!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the game with the Golden State Warriors against the San Antonio Spurs?
Yes I did. It was a close game
Do you remember the final score?
Warriors won. 120-108
Kevin Durant was incredible in the third quarter.
Yes he was. He scored a lot of points.
How many points did he score in the last quarter, do you remember?
It was 19 points.
Does this put the team in the lead for the conference?
Yeah 3-0 lead in the series.
How many points total did Durant score the entire game?
33 points I think
He also had 10 rebounds
They really came back at the end of the game.
Where was the game played at I don't remember?
It was at the AT&T Convention Center in San Antonio
When do the Warriors and Spurs play again?
They play again Sunday 5/22 Game Four
What time is it on?
9 PM on ESPN. I hope the Warriors win it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think either the Cavs or Warriors will go 16-0 during this postseason?
It's possible, but I don't think it's likely.
I don't, either. But, if you had to choose one of the two to go undefeated, who would it be?
I'd probably go with the Warriors.
Even with LeBron James playing as well as he has been?
Don't get me wrong. I don't think either team will go undefeated, but the Warriors do have Durrant.
They didn't even sweep the Cavs during the regular season!
Well, I think the postseason is much different than the regular season.
That's true. Of the two teams that are still left besides the Cavs and Warriors, which one do you think has the best chance of upsetting things and making it to the finals?
The Celtics, I think.
You really don't think the Cavs are all that good!
It's not that. It's just that the Cavs are up 2-0 while Golden State are up 3-0 over the Spurs and it's easier to overcome a two game deficit than a three-game hole.
I get that. I would love to see the Warriors lose four straight, though.
Because you hate Golden State?
Less that then the fact that I really like San Antonio.
Well, I would like to see LeBron face the Spurs again.
I think he'd win this time because Duncan's gone and the team is old.
Yeah. It wouldn't be the same.
I think it would make for a good narrative on ESPN, though.
Ha! That is probably exactly what would happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the MVP?
Clearly Russ, right?
Yea, I guess, but I don't know. He had to lead there.
So did Harden, didn't he?
Yea, but Harden actually won games.
Yea, so did Russ. Just not enough.
They both are solid candidates, but have you seen Russ?
Yea, he takes it to another level.
He does, but so does Harden. They are great players.
Lets just say Kawhi and call it a day.
That would be fun, but he just isn't quite there yet.
Na, not yet, but he could be soon.
He quickly took over as the leader of the Spurs.
Yea, I'll give him that.
Yea, hes a gamer, but Russ.
I understand. That guy can play.
Don't leave Lebron out either.
We always leave Lebron out. He just keeps doing his thing though.
Look, Russ has to be the guy. Has to be.
We will see soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of the teams you have to look out for next year is the Timberwolves.
They are such a young and exciting team.
They really are and I absolutely love Karl Anthony Townes.
This guy is a beast and a future All-star
He is putting up crazy numbers and on top of that they have Wiggins, Lavine and Rubio.
A very nice offensive lineup to say the least
Where they need to grow is in their defensive intensity.
Yeah if they want to make the playoffs next year they have to play better on that end
You would think with Coach Thibodeau they would be better already.
I know right. That is his calling card, but it hasn't happened yet
Well that's the next step in their maturity process
They have to start slowing other teams down.
I think they also need a couple of guys who can shoot the three
Yeah that would really open this offense even moe
They are already hard to defend this makes them more dangerous
Yeah this would make them unguardable.
I'm so looking forward to what they bring to the table next year
I would like to see them play even faster
For sure. If they can keep this core together. We could be seeing a championship in five years
I agree. Almost all of the pieces are there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Bulls organization seems really lost
I agree. The Dwayne Wade signing was a bad decision.
He didn't fit with this offense
No he didn't. Matter of fact this whole roster didn't fit
I have no idea what this organization is trying to do
And what do they do with Rajon Rondo.
I mean he played like garbage the majority of the year, but look good in the playoffs.
That is until he got hurt.
Bingo. Can they build this team around Jimmy Butler
I don't know if Jimmy Butler is a bonafied superstar. I mean he is a good player
Yes good, but not great
And that's the dilemma. They went from thinking Derrick Rose was their franchise player to now Jimmy
I think he needs a superstar to play with for this to work out
He is not the type of guy that can lead a team to the promise land
But you have to pay him max money because you can't lose him.
I see what you are saying. Can they get big name free agents to go there?
I think they could especially if Wade decides to opt out
He would be leaving a lot of money on the table though
Yeah he would, but you would think it's not about the money for him at this point
Yeah, but it's always about the money
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the game last night?
Which game?
The Warriors and the Spurs.
Oh.  No, I didn't catch it.  Who won?
The Warriors, 120 to 108.
Nice.  They're really slaying the Spurs this year.
Yeah.  This is game 3, and they're undefeated this conference.
Well, the Spurs weren't fantastic this year.
What?  The Spurs had a great season!  That's how they made it to the conference.
I admit they've been okay, but they haven't been great this year.  They're not the Celtics or anything like that.
Fine, they're not the Celtics.  But the Spurs have had a good season!
I'm just not feeling that.  I think they got into the Western Conference on a fluke.
They're second in their division!  They beat the Rockets, Clippers..
Yeah, but they didn't beat the Warriors, did they?
Fine. They didn't beat the Warriors, yet.  We've still got a couple of games to go.
Yeah, fine.  When's the next game?
Monday, the 22nd.  It's in Oakland.
They'd better win it, otherwise their season is going to end early.
Yeah.  We'll see what happens.
That we will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about this game tonight?
I can't believe Boston actually closed the gap!
I know!  Tied at 99?
Oh, Cleveland's up 2 again.
Boston tried for the 3-pointer!
They're really putting up a fight tonight.
It's about time!  That last game was humiliating.
It sure was.  A loss of 44 points?
That's sad.  I know they lost Thomas but he isn't the only good player on the team.
Well, it's good to see them fighting again.
Yeah.  I've been seeing plenty of fouls tonight.
They're scared and fighting hard with the Cavs.
Yep, and now they're up by 1 again.
And tied again.  This is crazy!
2 minutes left!
They just keep going back and forth.
Another foul, this time by Smith.
They were trying to play keep away.
The refs are checking for the 3-point line.
Good, a free throw.  And Boston's up one again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man how is the game going today?
Things are not going the best to be honest?
Why not?
The teams down by five and the second half is almost over
Sounds pretty stressful
It is im nervous about the loss
Why are you nervous about losing?
Because I bought some tickets to a bet.
So you would lose them if you lost the game?
Yeah and if I win I get double tickets so I'm on the edge of my seat.
Gotta have faith in your team it's only five points
You are correct just slightly nervous you get me
Yeah I get you but hopefully they score again
They got the ball now so I'm hoping so
Their you go!
Yeah I should trust your basket ball judgment.
I am good at betting on basket ball for a reason
I know you do it a lot.
Next time ask me before you do it so I can advise you
I will do that for sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you think it's fair to say Michael Jordan is the greatest player of all time?
Well, he is generally regarded as the best of all time. But if he is the greatest, where are all of the rings?
He might not have the most rings but he helped bring Basketball to mainstream America with his crossovers.
I think Jordan is the most prolific basketball player that was able to do everything, from defense to offense.
True.  People can claim that people have done much more impressive things than him, like Wilt Chamberlain's 100, Bill Russell's 11 rings and Kareem's with the most points ever.
They even claim that LeBron is near or even on Jordan's level, and that he wouldn't have been that good without Pippen/Rodman,
Shoot. His Airness has created a threshold that players, professional or not, try to reach or recreate.
Michael even mentored Kobe and he's without a doubt one of the best players ever to play.
I don't know about all of that.Kobe is and was a ball hog in my opinion.
You just don't like Kobe.
What is there to like about a selfish player like him?
I wouldn't go that far.  And yes I think it is fair to say Jordan is the best NBA player to ever play the sport.
I think it's more than fair.
Yeah.  With his ability to do everything and his high flying dunks, I agree.
Nowadays, so many new and upcoming players are copying Jordan's dunks.
True. You can tell they watch tapes of the man and strive to be like if not better than Jordan.
You know some people say though, "If Jordan was the best player ever, why doesn't he have the scoring title or the most championships?"
This is logic that I've heard before, and it's quite frankly ridiculous.
Yeah, me too. I was watching a program last night and they were saying Jordan couldn't win until Bird and Magic declined.
I honestly never understood this reasoning. It's like saying "Kobe wouldn't have won if Prime Jordan was still playing"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Good day.
How are you.
Well, you?
Not bad.  Any interest in basketball?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you like college or NBA.
Both I guess.
Do you have a team.
For college or pros?
Either.
Hmm let me think.
I like the Golden State Warriors I guess.
Yeah a lot of people like them.
Steph Curry is a great player.
Can't argue there.
I think they'll win it all this year.
We'll see what Lebron has to say about that.
Yeah you're right, but I still think they will beat them.
Guess we'll find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lebron was a first team selection for the 11th time?
Yeah, next year he will break the record with his 12th selection.
All I want to know is who voted Lebron the the 4th team.
I know, crazy right. I can't wait to see once they release the full details of voting.
I don't think Anthony Davis should have been first team, do you?
I think Curry should have switched places with him. I don't think they put enough on team success with regards to voting.
I was just excited Wall finally made a team.
After his first season or two in Washington people started using the word "bust"
When do they announce the winners?
June 26th, I wonder why they wait so long.
How does the media actually vote?
They use points awarded on a 5-3-1 basis.
How many points did Harden average?
I think it was around 29.1 - which would be a high for him.
The thing that is crazy to me is who voted for Blake Griffin?
Yeah, He only had one vote....but seriously?
The thing I hate about  media "voting" is there could be such a discrepancy.
Did you have a chance to see the final scores? Some of them make me shake my head.
Did Jimmy Butler make a team?
Yes, third with 102 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won the game last night?
Washington Wizard won
They were playing the Celtics right?
yeah the series is now tied 3-3
So it is going to a game seven
yes. Who do you want to win?
I don't really care I am just looking forward to the finals
Do you have someone you want to win it all?
I am going for the Spurs or Golden State
Ok why?
I like the western conference better, and I like popovich
Do you not like Lebron?
I don't care I think he is a little overrated
He is a good player
Oh yes of course he is, but I think Steph Curry is a good player too
I see you don't think Lebron is the best?
He might be the best now, but not necessarily the best ever
yeah there are a lot of contenders for that
Of course Lebron has to win more championships to be on the list of best ever
I agree, but I am hoping the Cavs win it all this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any chance you think the Celtics go to the Finals?
Who says theyre topping Washington?
Isaiah Thomas will make sure they keep winning.
Not so much, John Wall is going nuts.
He comes up small sometimes.
He might but this team looks better than most.
Crazy to think the Celtics might have a top 3 pick.
Oh they definitely will.
We dont know that for sure.
We find out in 8 days.
If they do they may be good for years.
The NBA is so hit or miss you never know.
I think they will have success for a while.
I dont know, free agency kills dynasties.
Tell that to LeBron James.
he creates his own
all conversations come back to him
you know that. hes the face of the NBA.
Well he wont win the chip this year.
Strangers things have happened
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Warriors game last night?
Yeah they swept the Jazz.
Who do you think will win MVP?
Westbrook, come on, he got a triple double for the whole season.
You think LeBron is a wimp?
Yes, he flops like a fish and crys everytime he is fouled.
Do you think it will be Cavs vs Warriors in the finals?
Yeah it doesn't look like anyone can beat those two.
Who's better Steph Curry or Kevin Durant?
Kevin Durant by a mile.
Do you think Paul George stays with the Pacers?
No, I think he will be going to the Lakers.
Will the Knicks every get good?
Not with Phil Jackson running the team.
Any chance Westbrook leaves the Thunder?
No he will stay because Durant left last year.
The Thunder could have had an amazing team.
Yeah Durant, Westbrook, and James Harden.
Who do you think will get the first pick in the draft?
Probably the Knicks or Nets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
How are you.
Good, you?
Good.  Do you like watching basketball?
Yeah I do.
Did you play basketball at all?
I did a little bit.
Me too, I played up until high school.
I didn't make it that far.
How far?
I played JV a little bit.
Were you any good?
No, that's the reason I never made varsity.
Oh I see.
Were you?
I was okay, but was in a tiny high school.
Oh I see.
Yeah.
ok, bye.
XXXXXXXXXXX
DId you see the basketball game last night?
No, I didn't! What happened?
Oh it was crazy! I can't believe you missed it....
Just tell me what went down!
The game was between the Lakers and the Magic.
Okay, I love the Lakers.
I love the Magic.
Well, we can agree to disagree.
Well long story short, the Magic won.
That's nice! Was there a large point margin?
Not really, Magic was at 110 and Lakers was at 104.
Well good on the Lakers for almost trying.
Yeah, I agree. Are you going to watch the game next week?
Depends who is playing. Who are the teams?
I heard it's the Magic again versus the Warriors.
Hm, I'll have to check it out! Are the warriors good?
They're alright, but I think they're definetely memorable.
I agree with you. Well what time are the games at so I can watch?
They usually start at 7pm our time.
Great! Well I'll have to watch the game then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you follow basketball at al?
Kind of, but not much recently. Why?
Just curious if you've been a fan of the celtics!
I guess I'd say I am, but i haven't been watching lately.
Why not?
I haven't been an avid fan since the 90s. I feel like they've gone downhill since then.
You haven't been watching lately then, have you!?
I haven't, why?
They've been doing awesome, they won tonight like 111 to 106 or something like that!
Wow, it's been a while since bball has been going on in the Garden still this late in the season.
Tell me about it! Why haven't you been watching since the 90s?
They were great then. When they ha Larry Bird. I've kinda lost hope since then.
They did suck for the past several years.
Yeah I'd hear scores hear and there and realized I wasn't msising out on anything.
I went to a game like 4 years ago and more than have the crowd left before the end.
Who did they play?
I don't even remember, guess that's a sign of how memorable the game was.
I'll say!
But you should really start watching again!
Maybe I will- maybe we'll see each other at the Garden!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Well thank you, and you?
Good.  Are you a basketball fan?
Yes I am.
Who is your team?
I am fan of Golden State.
Oh nice.  Have to love Steph.
Yeah he is the man.
I am a fan of the Cavs.
Oh really?
Yep, we'll probably be playing yall in the finals.
I think so too.
I don't think there is much competition for either of our teams.
Nope, it looks like the playoffs are leading to that final again.
I think it'll be a great series.
Me too, can't wait.
Well, best of luck.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is currently winning in the NBA finals?
The warriors are kicking butt.
Oh yeah. what's the score?
Warriors 3 Spurs 0.
Wow, they mean business!
Yeah, and with Leonard out the Spurs are in trouble.
Oh no what happened?
He hurt his ankle!
How long is he out for?
They aren't sure.
Sounds like Kevin Durant is a beast.
Yeah he scored 33 points the other night.
Wow that's amazing.
Stephen Curry is rocking it too!
Oh yeah, how many points did he score?
I think like 20.
Wow those two are a great combination.
It's going to be hard for the Spurs to come back, that's for sure.
When's the next game?
Tonight at 8:30 pm
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you still play?
Not recently.
They've been repaving the basketball field around our apartment.
No way?
Yeah, it's active.
That owns hard.
We ought to get a few people around.
I mean, I'm busy.
Really?
Yeah, what do you mean, 'really'?
Like, it's basketball.
Work is work, idiot.
It's good.
It sucks.
No it doesn't, what?
It's not good at all.
You were killer.
I got a job.
Come on.
I have responsibilities.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see the game last night?
Which game?
The basketball game between the Golden State Warriors and Utah Jazz?
Yes it was good, Steph Curry hit a bunch of threes.
Yes, he did they beat the Utah jazz 121 to 95.
Wow, can you say blowout?
It was such a good game there coach Steve Kerr is doing a great job with them
Yeah, I remember when he was on the Chicago bulls he was a good player as well.
I think the players on the Golden state warriors are all skilled.
Yeah, they all pretty much can shoot 3's and dribble really good.
Not only that, there defense is really on point.
Do you think there going to win the Championship this year?
I hope so, that would be cool being thats my hometown.
I think this is going to be an interesting season.
Yeah, they might get to do a repeat and play against Cleveland Cavilers.
Yeah, that would be awesome.
Hopefully the warriors can stop Lebron James Kyrie Irving
That team has a lot of talent but i think the warriors will beat them this year.
Well your invited to come over this weekend and watch the game with us if you like.
For sure ill let you know
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the playoffs?
Only when they are on TNT.
Don't you have direct TV?
Yeah but I don't have the sports package.
Don't even get espn then?
No but I still get to watch some games.
It is kinda lame the same teams look like they are going to the finals.
I know, I wish Cleveland and Golden State would lose.
I don't think they will, maybe the Spurs can win.
No way without Tony Parker they are toast against the Warriors.
Probably, I wish the Rockets would have won.
Me too, their bench really forgot to show up.
Yeah, I thought Lou Williams was a great pickup but he was invisible.
Maybe Boston or Washington can Pull off an upset.
Not a chance, they both suck.
Anyone can win, you just need a couple shooters to get hot.
Except you need a couple of shooters, who can compete with the three shooters of the big two?
Beal maybe, I think Boston wins at home though.
That's how it has gone so far, home team wins.
I hope it is a triple overtime fiasco.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Derrick Rose will ever be the player he was suppose to be?
No, he will just end up fading away and hanging on to long.
How tall is Joakim Noah?
I want to say around 6'11....I could be off a little though.
If you had to pick one Duncan or Robinson?
They are both great players in their prime, can I say neither and pick Shaq?
Best 3 point shooter of all time?
Currently?? Curry without a doubt. All time....Miller.
Who is your all time favorite player?
Walt Frazier, his domaence is so under rated.
Do you think they should do away with the 1 and done rule?
Yes, I think its hurting the college game more than its helping the NBA.
Do you think Paul George will sign with the Lakers?
Last week, no - this week yes....he was snubbed off of the all-nba team.
Are you surprised Chris Paul wasn't picked either?
Honestly, no I'm not....he had a terrible season by his standards and so many players had career years.
Do you think George will chase the money or a championship?
He's gotta chase the money, any championship team won't be able to pay him what he wants.
Do you think George and the Lakers are a good fit?
NO! They are young, real young and George wants to win now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are the Cavs doing?
I dont know man. Seems like their winning.
Thats what elite players do I guess.
Yea, Lebron just has it. He's the best there is.
Well I cant deny that. He just goes into another level in the playoffs.
Yea, he does. Its Lebron against the world.
Well Lebron is beating the world then.
Yea, he just puts his team on his back in the playoffs.
They finally experienced what it was like to struggle this year too.
Yea, they did and it helped.
Do you think they are better from it?
Have you seen them play? It sure looks like it.
Yea, I just haven't seen them play against any elite talent.
Me either, but they might have to eventually.
Well yea, with the Warriors.
They are just a tough team.
Yea, they have great players.
4 of them!
Yea, it's almost not fair.
Yea, thats been established.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about those Celtics?
What about them?
Well, they have a nice core.
Eh, the Cavs are no competition for them.
Yea, but the Cavs aren't picking first in the draft.
So who are your saying is their savior?
Markelle Fultz
Where is he gonna play?
Right alongside Isaiah Thomas?
You're gonna put Fultz at the shooting guard position?
Yes, I think so.
Where would Avery Bradley go?
Look to trade him.
Trade your defense stopper?
You gotta do something to get Fultz into the lineup.
But that for a rookie?
Yea, hes got immense talent.
We'll see, but I dont know about the Celtics.
Just watch out next year.
We will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey User 2 have you been watching the NBA playoffs?
No. I've only heard a couple of things here and there. What are the standings?
Currently on the west coast Golden State are ahead of the Spurs 3 to zero game wise.
What about on the east coast?
The Celtics and the Cavaliers are playing but the Cavaliers are ahead in 2 to 0.
Looks like it's going to be Golden State VS The Cavaliers in the finals then.
That is what I'm thinking too but I'd like it if the Celtics made it to the finals instead of the Cavaliers.
I'd like to see the Spurs make it personally.
Yeah I'm kind of sick of seeing the same old teams make it to the finals.
Yes, I agree it gets pretty stale if you look at it like that. It makes you wonder what other teams are missing.
Honestly? I think it comes down to work ethic and competitive spirit. I just think the bottom teams are lazy.
Really? I think it comes down to having start players and proper coaching staff.
I can see why you'd think that but it just limits teams that don't have those things. I feelt if you work hard enough you can beat top talent.
I don't agree, I mean sure you can put in a large amount of effort and get better but to beat the real professionals takes more.
That's what I mean. If you work hard enough in time you will become a start talent yourself and beat others.
That's true I honestly didn't think about it like that but you are correct.
That's why I feel the bottom teams are just lazy, they don't want to win they just want to play.
I'm not sure if I was a player I'd just be fine with playing. I'd want to win too.
Say that when your playing professional basket ball for millions of dollars a year.
That's true. I guess even if I lost the games I'd still win in the bank department.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Spurs Rockets game tonight?
I sure did and the Spurs spanked them.
It was awful, I bet on Houston.
Why would you do that? The Spurs have so much history of success.
I wasn't, but right before game time their best player Kahwai Leonard was not going to play.
Still risky bet don't you think for a game 6.
Frankly, no. The home team has won ever game of the series.
Well, then what happened? Why did Houston lose?
Because I think Houston felt the game would be a breeze to win.
Because they had won all their home playoff games?
No, because with the Spurs two best players out, they just mailed it in.
Well, who is to blame?
The whole team and coaching staff. They got sucker punched into thinking San Antonio would not try and wait til game 7 when they would be at full strength
That makes some sense, but still the wrong way for a professional to behave.
I'll say it was despicable frankly. You should have seen the crowd.
What did the fans do?
They Boo'd the Rockets like crazy for a lack of effort.
Were the boos directed at anyone in particular?
Yep. James Harden, A potential MVP and he gave no effort. Played awful.
I always felt Harden was not a championship caliber player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how to play basketball?
A little bit but I do not know all of the rules. Do you want to teach me more?
Sure I can teach you a few of the rules what do you want to know?
What is traveling?
Traveling occurs when rather than dribbling the basketball you hold the ball while still moving or taking steps.
So can I take any steps when holding the ball
Yes, you can take two steps when holding the ball. At which point you must shoot or pass the ball.
So how do the points work in basketball?
Typically the points in basketball are 2 points and 3 points. 2 points are awarded for most baskets.
How do you get 3 points in the game?
Three points are provided in a basketball game when you make a basket from behind the three point line. This is further away from the basketball hoop.
So it could be a risk trying to make 3-point shots I guess.
There are also penalties in basketball. A penalty may occur when a player pushes another player, a foul.
What happens when a penalty occurs?
Depending on the location of the penalty, penalty shots may be awarded.
What is a penalty shot?
A penalty shot provides the player that was fouled with two shots into the hoop from the top of the key. The other players must stand on the side of the key and not defend their basket.
Sounds like penalty shots could allow a team to make lots of points.
Each penalty shot is only worth 1 point. Typically if you make the first shot you get a second shot opportunity.
So the three ways to make points are regular 2-point shots, 3-point shots, and penalty shots?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the NBA Playoffs?
I have, but mostly when Golden State Warriors are playing.
I know.  I love Golden State. I love Steph Curry especially.
Me too. I like them because they are humble.
They always look like they're having fun.
Yes, and I feel there is no animosity or jealousy among teammates.
I know, I was sad when they lost last year.
Me too.  Do you like Lebron James?
I used to, but I saw him being rude to Guillermo from Jimmy Kimmel Show.
He is a great player, but sometimes attitude comes through.
That's why I like Steph Curry. He has a great sense of humor.
I know, he's always dancing, and doing stuff with and for fans.
Not so happy with the wife though.  HaHa
I started watching basketball about two years ago, after seeing Curry on the All Star Games.
Oh. Ive been watching for a long while.  I used to like the Heat.
I think The Heat was good.  Mostly when Lebron was there, but also with out him.
I think Dwayne Wade is a great player.
Im surprised they didnt make the playoffs.
Well, this will be year three in a row that the Cavs and Warriors are in, I think.
Well Im rooting for the Warriors!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You going to the game tonight?
Nah no way i can i am stuck at home babysitting
Thats a shame i was wanting to go tonight.
You can go but catch some highlights for me though at least.
I am hoping to do more than just catch a few highlights.
What do you plan to do?
I want to get something signed to make it memorable
Good luck with that it will never happen.
It will too just watch.
If you say so man.
You better turn the game on and watch then because you will see
I will turn the game on then you know the time it will air.
It will be airing on TBS at around seven is the time you should check it.
I will try to watch it but i will most likely just listen as i will be busy.
Nah man you gotta see it if you can to catch the fun of it all
I will try i want to look at the stats though what site do you use for the team stats?
I usually just use ESPNs tracker as it is easy.
I was thinking you used another site.
Nah i find ESPN the easiest way to track the players
Cool i will check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch game 7 between the Celtics and Wizards?

The Wizards had the most turnovers with 15.
Okay, what was the final score between both teams?
The Celtics won with 115 points while the Wizards only scored 105 points.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Warriors and the Spurs last night?
Yes, I did, Spurs did pretty good the 1st half.
They ended the first half a little ahead, and I thought maybe they might have a chance.
I had my doubts, as the Spurs are down two to one and don't have Leonard or Parker playing.
The youngsters did a pretty good job trying to keep up the second half, but just couldn't quite do it.
That's ok, they had a respectable score at the end and there is always next season.
Hopefully Leonard and Parker can get back next season and bring it home for the Spurs.
I agree, and the newbies will have increased their skills too.
What did you think about Aldridge?
Everyone says he has the skills, but somehow he is not performing up to par.
To me, it looks like he just doesn't have the confidence.
I agree.
He sure isn't a Tim Duncan.
I really miss him.
Me too, ah well, the Spurs have what they have
Yep, hoping for a great season next year.
What do you think about what Ginobli is doing this season.
Way beyond expectations, although he seemed to be off last night
Yah, but he is fun to watch , no matter what
He sure is, he isn't afraid of anyone.

I can see the NBA decreasing playoff teams soon
No way TV Will not allow that
But what is the point of all the games then?
Iron out seeding in my opinion.
So cut the season down and playoffs in half.
And lose almost an entire season of ad revenue?
They can make it up.
Not true, player salaries keep increasing as well.
I think you are overthinking all of this.
No I think they are trending in the right direction to try and make it harder to get in the playoffs.
I sort of believe that.
But I think the playoffs this year are an abberation.
In what sense?
They havent been competitive at all.
I think thats just the way the NBA is this year.
Not one series has really been too interesting outside of Boston and Washington
I think they could have been better I do agree with that.
They need to look into fixing this before it becomes a yearly things
Like I said its just a one time thing
Or a sign of worse things to come

What was the final score for the Cavs game?
It was like 130-86....just pitiful.
Even the Bulls would've put up more of a fight than this (with a healthy Rondo).
I'm not saying Bulls would win the series but they'd at least win ONE game.
Imagine GSW and Cavs going to the finals both having 12-0 records .
And imagine one winning 3 in a row, that 4th game would be epic.
Boston just seems like their playing with no heart.
Nope, no heart and their playing like their scared.
Who do you think is going to win rookie of the year?
I think Brogdon is going to win but Embid will make it close.
Who is your Defensive Player of the year ?
Leonard by far, I still hate to think about him and what happened with his ankle. It would be a different series.
Isaiah Thomas spoke too soon when he said The Cavs aren't the "Monstars."
Exactly, he trash talked...hurt his hip and lost by almost 50points.
The Celtics have the number one pick... lots of talented and potentially tradable pieces, decent cap space.
Your right, the Celtics will be scary in the next couple years.
The Cavs are just showing to the Warriors how to win a game, without hurting a player on the opposing team.
I hate the Warriors as much as anybody, but Zaza's play on Kawhi wasn't dirty at all.
I just can't wait for the finals. Its going to be one of the all-time great series.
I want everyone to be healthy. Both teams playing great basketball we should have no excuse.

Do you think the Warriors will pull it off this year?
I think so. I think they have the most wins this year right?
Yeah. But remember what happened last year.
The Cavaliers won, barely, and in game 7. The Warriors are better this year though.
Yeah. First they have to knock out the Spurs.
Which they will. And the Cavaliers will knock out Boston.
I would be shocked if it didn't come down between the Cavaliers and Warriors.
That would be interesting.
But it's not going to happen.
But anyway, I don't know. we'll see if the Cavaliers have a plan this year.
I know they got Williams now. That's the only thing I see that could be a game changer for them.
Korver isn't shooting 3's as well as he used to.
And maybe Williams will make up for that.
Whatever. I'm just glad Williams didn't end up here in Utah. We were considering trading for him.
I doubt anyone in Utah wants Williams back. But yeah I heard that was a possibility.
We still hold a little bit of a grudge for what he did to Sloan and Hayward.
To Hayward? What did Williams do to Hayward?
He was just constantly disrespecting him on the court.
Like how? What did he do?
He threw the ball at him, berated him so many times right after each play.
