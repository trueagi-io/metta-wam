Did you ever feel in the Order of the Phoenix that Harry would end up with Luna?
You mean because of the ending of that one?
It was such a cute moment, and I thought for sure it meant that Harry and Luna would have a thing later on.
They were both from too sad of a background I think. But, I did like that moment.
There were some really small moments in the films that always got me.
I liked when Mr. Weasly was so excited to ask Haryy questions.
And he was so happy, he just over looked the fact that Harry was more of less a famous guy.
When he asked " What exactly is the purpose of a rubber ducky?", I crack up every time!
I think he was one of the best. He always made the show feel lighter.
I loved when he just left the flying car sitting around. Like it was a normal machine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about Snape?
he is a bad guy right?
i dont think so.
What do you mean?
he loved Lily Potter and Harry.
i thought he was a Death Eater.
He was a double agent.
i missed that.
its complicated.
I should see it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Harry complained way too much in this movie.
You think so?
Absolutely.  He basically screamed at his friends the whole time.
Well, in his defense, you try being the chosen one.
Just because he was pressured doesn't mean he should yell at Hermione and Ron the whole time.
Well, look at it from Harry's perspective.  It was a great burden he never asked for.
Just because you are facing adversity doesn't mean being rude to people.
Ron didn't help things either.  He was always jealous of Harry.
I don't know why.  He got to marry Herimione.
Yeah, he did get lucky in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think they should continue the series.
do you mean how their lives played out after hogwarts?
yes, like did they go to wizarding college
and where did they honeymoon when they got married.
what happened to hagrid after hogwarts?
is he still alive?
I don't know, but maybe he has an extended life expectancy.
since he is half giant.
yes! we may never know
Maybe not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite character from the Harry Potter movies?
Oh gosh, I don't know. There are so many!
But if you had to choose just one, who would it be?
This may be unusual, but I like Snape.
Well, that is different. Why him?
He sacrificed so much in order to help people.
And he got little to no recognition or thanks.
Exactly, he is such a great character that way.
It is funny because you hate him for almost all of the movies until the very end.
That is why he is the best character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Potter villian.
Other that "He who is not to be Named?"
Obviously.
Probably Worm Tail.
The guy who was a rat.
Yup.
Why? He was so weird looking.
I think that's why.
He did look as if he could be a rat.
Indeed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the chamber of secrets
It was long
Yea almost three hours, but worth it
That was the second year at hogwarts, right?
Yea, it was a good movie
I liked it
I liked the human chess game
That was really neat
I would like to try that
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could see a side movie about any Harry Potter character who would it be?
Mad Eye, no doubt.
Yeah, he was one of the best characters.
I'd like to see how he fought in the fist wizard war.
He was awesome.  Scary good guys are always the best kind.
I know right?  I'd also like to see him before he was all beat up.
It would be great to see him accumulate the scars one by one.
And see how he takes out some of the most fearsome Deatheaters.
They should give him an enemy that he goes back and fourth with.
And maybe even a few scruffs with Voldemort himself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think actor who played Harry Potter looked like what you imagined Harry Potter to look like?
No he didn't to me. I grew to like him but he got kind of weird looking as he got older.
I thought so too. I liked Rupert Grint for Ron but he didn't look anything like Ron from the books.
Yeah, he was supposed to have a long skinny nose and be very lanky. That kid was not that but he fit pretty well.
What about the Weasley twins....not what I expected either.
No, but it was okay. I think they were under utilized as characters in the movie and the books.
I would have liked to see more of them too. They were great characters.
I liked that they were good natured pranksters. Who couldn't like them?
I know, I think they could caused more havoc when the deatheaters took over the school.
Yeah, but remember they were gone by then. Doing the joke shop thing but they came back to join the fray when the time was right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone?
Yeah! I love that movie.
I think it's the best of all the movies. Happie Birthday Harry Potter
Yer a wizard Harry!
And the way Hermione is such a bossy intelligent young women at such a young age.
Those kids were really good actors!
I love Malfoy to be entirely honest
Are you serious? He's a brat
I guess you're right. McGonnagal would be the best teacher. I wish I had her
Oh me too! Imagine a teacher that can turn into a cat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the final scene of the last Harry Potter movie?
It makes me cry every time. Especially when Harry is walking to the forest and all of his loved ones who've passed away come back to be with him.
Same! What do you think about the part when he sees Dumbledore at the place that looks like Kings Cross Station?
I wasn't sure what to make of it. I didn't really understand it. Did you?
I think that the dead thing in the station with them is a representation of the Horcrux that was living inside of Harry.
What do you mean by a Horcrux?
A Horcrux is made when somebody splits their soul into different parts, hopefully giving them immortal life. Voldemort split his soul into 7 parts, and one lived inside Harry, so Harry had to die for Voldemort to die too.
Oh, I see now. So that dead thing is the Horcrux which actually did die, but Harry survived?
Yes. Voldemort didn't know that he had put a Horcrux into Harry though, it was an accident when he killed James and Lily Potter.
Wow! There's so much more that happened than I realized. I really need to read the books.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Do you know the harry potter world?
Yeah pretty well.
Did you read the books?
Yeah read all the books.  Did you?
No, but I've seen the movies.
Did you have a favorite.
I like the first one a lot.
Ah interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, I just finished the Goblet of Fire movie, and some of the visuals were just insane.
What part do you mean? The fight at the Ministry?
Well, that is the big one of course. The Dumbledore and Voldemort fight.
The sheer power was amazing, it actually felt real for the first time.
Agreed, a lot of the show of power before that was just kinda cheesy in the other movies.
But this felt like an actual fight to the death, right? The lightning crackling sealed it for me, it was so cool.
Then after the fight you see the sand moving.
That part was too much, I had trouble breathing.
Yep, the sand moving slowly and you know something bad is going to happen.
Then Harry gasps and Voldemort tries to take possession of him. Most intense part in any of the movies to that date at least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just went back and rewatched the first couple of Harry Potter movies, and... you know, they're... kind of not good.
You just noticed that?
I don't know; they seemed great at the time. But they don't really... work as movies, at all.
No, they don't. It's not until the third movie, when they get in a real director, that they start to stand alone.
Stand alone -- yeah. I kinda feel like they expected me to have the book open in my lap while I was watching.
I think Chris Columbus was just scared of taking any liberties, so instead of making a coherent movie he just adapted a series of memorable scenes, verbatim, with little in the way of connective tissue.
I think it's safe to say those two are total write-offs. When does the new Dumbledore come in, anyway?
Gambon started in the third one, yeah, Azkaban. So you can kinda pretend that's a soft reboot, I guess.
That works for me.
From here on, the kids actually try to act, also. Before, you get the sense that Columbus just propped them in the right positions and told them what face to pull.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Harry Potter moves yet?
Yes, all of them. Have you?
Yes. I think the first movie and the sixth movie are the best.
Yeah. Half-Blood Prince was my favorite.
I was sad when Dumbledore died.
So was I, but I had just read the book so I was expecting it.
I also really liked the first movie.
I think that was the movie that best captured the book.
Agreed. What was your favorite thing the movie did that the book didn't.
The music. That tone will forever play in my head when I think of Harry Potter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well, I let my kids watch all of the Harry Potter movies finally.
Really? What did they think of them?
They were hooked from the first scene of Sorcerer's Stone.
That is not suprising. They are fantastic films.
I agree, I think that they're favorite one was Goblet of Fire.
They have good taste, that is also my favorite.
My daughter just about fell in love with Ron Weasley.
Really? Why him?
I am not sure. I think she just liked that he is kind of a goof ball.
That he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched Goblet of Fire again the other day!
Oh? Was it on television?
No, I found the DVD and decided to give it another go. You know, I never realized that Cedric was played by Rob Pattinson!
No? I really prefer him as Cedric; seeing him in Twilight really kind of ruined it for me!
I hear you. But I'll tell you, Amos' reaction after Cedric's death gets me every time. It's the most realistic reaction I've ever seen.
It makes me sad every time I watch it, too.
But I love the ball storyline. Seeing Ron get all thrown off by Hermione's transformation is still hilarious.
I do wish they'd done some things a little more like that book, though. I thought some parts needed a little more reaction or emotion.
Agreed. And I missed the scene from the book where Hermione teaches Krum how to say her name.
I know. It's perfect. Hermmy-o-ninny! I still laugh!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched a Harry Potter film lately.
No.
Have you seen any of them?
I watched the first film.
And did you like it?
I liked the castle part.
That castle was pretty.
I heard they based it on Oxford.
Would you go to school there?
It seems dangerous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?
I really like Deathly Hallows Part 1.
Really? I think that's the weakest movie in the entire series. Really drab and slow.
Huh, that's why I like it. They really make the audience feel like Harry is struggling with his decisions.
Sure, but it's so drawn out. I mean, they could have just released a single movie instead of breaking the last book up into two movies.
Well, that's true, but I guess the studio thought they could get people to come out to see both movies. Which movie in the series is your favorite?
I guess my favorite is probably The Prisoner of Azkaban.
Why is that your favorite?
Well, the first two were more kids movies, but by the third one the kids are starting to grow up, and they all do a better job acting.
You're right, and that's the movie directed by Alfonso Cuaron. He's one of my favorite directors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was watching HP series. Do you really think Snape is good guy or bad guy?
Everyone thinks he's a good guy. What do you mean?
You know, he's always riding Harry and he's kind of a butt head to everyone.
But he always seems to be helping Harry inadvertently.
Only because Dumbledore told him to and he felt guilty about Lilly.
Yeah, maybe but he was in love with her too.
Sure, maybe Snape could see her in Harry. They always talk about his green eyes and how he looks like his mother.
Yeah, see it could be that.
It would make a great twist if he's really bad to the core.
Well, guess you will have to finish the series to find out. I'm not spilling the beans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like all of the Harry Potter movies?
Mostly. I didn't love all the changes from the books.
What changes are you talking aboout?
Minor details like the color of Harry's eyes.
You mean Daniel Radcliff's eye color?
Yeah, Harry and his mother Lily are supposed to have to same eye color.
What color are they supposed to be?
Green.
I can't remember seeing Harry's mom in the movies.
She's played by actress Geraldine Somerville.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think jk rolling did a great job with the story line
She was very creative
Draco at the end became a good person don't you agree
I do agree. He realized his father was a bad guy
I heard in the last movie Dumbledore was actually sleeping during his death scene
Wow really that is too funny
I wonder how they came up with the spell names
Me too. They sound crazy.
I wish they would come out with a Harry potter series
Me too. The Harry potter franchise made a killing
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?
Yeah I have ! That's probably my favorite!
Really ? Why? That's my least.
I love that they travel back in time !
I personally prefer the goblet of fire. That one is so cool and action packed.
I like that one too. I love the maze at the end even though the ending is so sad for Cedric Diggory.
I agree. It's also pretty scary, that graveyard scene was done well.
Poor Harry having to experience that.
I would be so traumatized watching that death.
Me too. And to come back with the body like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the first Deathly Hallows?
It was pretty good.  It's amazing to see how quickly the wizarding world fell.
Proof to how powerful Voldemort really is.
Yeah, baldy is pretty powerful.  And clearly has agents everywhere.
The cliffhanger at the end was insane too.
When Voldemort gets the Elder Wand?
Yes!  How are they going to battle that powerful wizard with that powerful object?
The parts about the Deathly Hallows was cool too.
Yeah, seeing the history of these objects.
I'd even someday like to see more on their history and former owners.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever feel bad for Draco Malfoy?
All of the time! He is my favorite character.
He was just trying to make his parents happy!
And not get killed by Voldemort!
Oh yes that too. He did a good job with that!
And in the end his mom saved Harry!
Yeah when she said he was dead when he really wasn't!
She just wanted her son to be okay. They weren't all that evil.
But Voldemort and Bellatrix are truly evil.
They kill all the good people!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Listen. I have some problems with the potter movies
Really. Like what
Well, dumbldoor is way more intense than in the books
True. He tells more
Right. Also, I'm not super thrilled that they left peeves out
Exactly! He was important
Agreed. I wanted to see him interact with the twins
There was also no death day party.
I knoe!! So wrong. And what they did to genny.
Yeah. I'm with you in that. She was so much better in the books
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best line in the movie?
Oh thats easy.....Snape "ALways".
Do you like the first Dumbordore better or the one in the last one?
My heart will always be with the one in Socerers stone.
Would you want to work for the ministry of magic?
Yes, I would want to be like the Weasley Dad, and deal with human items.
Who is your favorite Weasley?
George
What was your favorite book?
Prisioner of Azchaban.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I noticed the other day that there was a Harry Potter marathon on, I got sucked into Goblet of Fire.
Ooo, I loved that one!
I love all the challenges that the kids do.
Which was your favorite?
I like the scene in the lake. It looks so cool with everyone on the stands watching.
Me too. I really like the task with the dragons.
Ooo, that's a good one too! I want a baby dragon.
Did you notice who Cedric Diggory is? It's the guy from Twilight.
I forgot about that. I loved his character in Harry Potter, he acted it really well.
Yes, I was really sad when he died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really confused about the patronuses.
What's confusing about them?
Do you get to choose your own?
Not really.  It's just an extension of what makes you happy.
I wish mine were a fox.
You never know.  It could be a giraffe for all you know.
Hey, that would be pretty cool.  Giraffes are huge.
Why stop there?  Maybe a T-Rex.
Now you're being ridiculous.
Stupify!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?
I've seen them all.
What one was your favorite?
I really liked the first one.
They seemed to stick closer to the book with that one.
I've never read any of the books.
Why haven't you read the books?
I'm not much of a reader.
You can borrow it if you want?
Yeah, why not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know something
What?
Hagrid is scary
From harry potter?
Yeah in the movies he scared me as a kid
Well i mean he is imposing
Yeah and huge
Well thats what i meant he did not scare me though
He sorta does still scare me a little though
That is silly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?
No I haven't.
Really, that is so odd. Most people have.
Ya, I just ever got around to it. What are they about anyways.
They are about a boy who finds out he is a wizard and ends up having to attend school at Hogwarts.
Oh. Who is in them.
They all have a lot of the same characters. One of them is Daniel Radcliffe and another is Emma Watson.
Oh, I like them.
Ya, you probably watch them grow up on screen.
Oh, thats cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your least favorite character in the Harry Potter series?
I really don't like Peter Pettigrew. He betrayed the Potters and ultimately helped Voldemort come back to power.
Yeah, and then he was so close to Harry throughout most of his time at Hogwarts but Harry didn't even know.
Wait, what do you mean he was close to Harry?
Peter Pettigrew was Ron's rat, Scabbers! He was an Animagus.
Oh, you're right! Now I remember. Whenever they would look at the Maurader's Map, they'd see Ron sleeping next to someone named Wormtail and be confused.
Who do you think your favorite character is?
I love both of the Weasley twins. I can't handle at the end of the last movie when Fred dies.
I know. I thought that was one of the saddest parts of the entire series.
So many people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There's one shot of Colin Creevy, that little boy who always had a camera, and that always makes me sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had me on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you're a big fan of the Harry Potter books. What did you think of the final movies?
I don't know. They were very good. But Harry and Hermione passionately kissing with no clothes on? I don't think that needed to be in a movie for children.
I agree. I didn't like the fact that they were so 'grown up' toward the end.
Well, they could have made them mature young adults, but they didn't quite need to visualize that. I took my six year old daughter to see that!
Oh no! And what happened?
Well, I have to admit, she didn't really understand it. She was more upset about Dobby suddenly dying!
Yeah tell me about it! Did they really need to kill off such an adorable, beloved character?
I guess they killed off a lot of beloved characters, but Dobby was a hard one to see go.
Overall though, I think the movies were as true to the books as possible.
Yes, that's true, they did a really good job of that, especially considering how much material is in the books!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder in the movies would be like if the series just continued as movies
Like no more books
Yeah no more books just movies
Well that would be interesting
I mean they could take a more visual approach
I mean i guess it would be interesting
To bad we shall never know
I mean take what you got though
I mean you are right
Yeah i totally am
XXXXXXXXXXX
Fick and Swish!
What are you doing?
Practicing my magic.
Potter nerd!
There having a marathon down at the theater.
Really?
Yup, wanna come.
Have to take a pass.
I thought you liked those movies.
Just not as much as you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The first movie seems very kid-friendly to me.
Well, you have to remember that the movies got darker as they went along.
Why's that?
The readers got older.  By the time they got to the end, they'd been at Hogwarts six years I think.
Guess that's true.  Still, it seemed too happy of a movie to me.
He defeated that Voldemort-thingy in the guy's head. Who wouldn't be happy?
But he really didn't defeat him, he just came back again.
Yeah, but Harry didn't know that.  He did what he had to.
It always seemed weird how Voldemort keep coming back.
Would have been hard making more movies if he didn't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite Harry Potter movie character? Besides Snape.
Besides Snape, I would have to say Luna Lovegood.
She's a trip, but I think my favorite by far is McGonagall.
Oh yeah. Maggie Smith killed that role.
Of all of the older British actresses that I know, she fits the part the best.
As if you know more than her and Judy Dench.
Anyhow. I loved the scene during the Battle of Hogwarts when she brought the statues to live.
"I've always wanted to use that spell." She looked SO happy when she said that.
It's another reason that that character was such a boss witch.
Ha. I see what you did there. Yes, I would have loved to have her as a teacher, or a grandmother, or just a neighbor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yesterday I sat down and watched Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone.
Have you seen it before or was this your first time?
It was my first time, I know that I am a bit late to the party haha.
Took you long enough...  What did you think of it?
I really enjoyed it overall, I am interested in seeing how the characters develop going forward.
Are you planning on watching the next one soon?
I will definitely be watching Chamber of Secrets sometime this week.
That's great to hear, they are some of my favorite movies and I'm really glad to hear that you like them.  Who is your favorite character so far?
I think that my favorite character thus far is Hagrid. I really liked how he has been helping Harry ever since the beginning when he shows up for his birthday.   I also think that he is a pretty good comic relief.  He can really ease the tension in some of the situations and his collection of creatures is quite interesting as well.
Definitely a good choice for a favorite character for sure.  I think that you'll enjoy Chamber of Secrets!  You'll have to let me know what you think of it afterwards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter Movie?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 for sure! I loved every bit of it!
What did you think of everything that transpired with Snape?
It was heartbreaking for sure! I love that we got to see his story from beginning to end, and see how he really was.
It was really sad. He is my favorite character.
Mine too. He is so complicated and diverse!
I do hate that so many characters had to die. Tonks, Fred Wesley, Lupin and Snape.
I know! Such great characters got killed off, making it so emotional!
I love the Harry Potter series. It is my favorite ever!
Mine too! Such an amazing stories, with some of the best characters ever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you caught up on your Harry Potter movies?
Yes! I finished it all last week.
I'm so glad! What did you think?
I thought it was so awesome.  I cannot believe Sirius Black died!
I know! He was such an influential person to Harry.
It was so sad! I cried!
What about Harry ending up with Ginny?
I totally saw that as a surprise.  I thought he would be with Cho Chang all the way.
Me too! I'm glad though since she is Ron's sister.
She definitely grew up into a beautiful young woman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part about Order of the Phenix?
I liked the scenes practicing in the room or requirement.
That was pretty cool, and seeing all the different Petronus.
I also liked how Harry finally got the girl.
Yeah that was great.  At least for a couple seconds it was.
We got a good look at Luna too, she's quite the character.
Tell me about it, she's a little strange but adds depth to the show.
Yeah, not everyone is big family somewhat normal Rob, or perfect little Harmine.
I also liked Dumpledore's escape.
Yep, that one guy was right.  He sure knows how to make an exit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm going to be watching all of the Harry Potter movies at my place today.
Really? That sounds fun.
Did you want to join me? It's going to be pretty laid back.
Sounds great, thanks!
Which movie is your favorite?
I really like The Half Blood Prince as far as the books go, but The Prisoner of Azkaban has to be my favorite movie.
Oh, wow, cool. My favorite movie is definitely The Goblet of Fire, but I think the book is absolutely better than the movie.
Yeah, for sure. They left out so many details in the movies that would have been awesome to include.
I really hope that someday they make the books into a television show and put in all the details.
I'd watch that for sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the first Harry Potter movie.
The Sorcerer's Stone?  I loved it.  Who directed it?
Chris Columbus.
Emma Watson was so cute in that.
Yes, pre-puberty.
Who played the ghost?
John Cleese!
I loved him th Monty Python.
Yes, he was cool.  I loved the chess match.
I heard there was an increase in chess set sales after that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite character in the Harry Potter series?
I would say Draco Malfoy.
Yeah hes a real douche of a character.
As much as I don't like him, he did seem to have somewhat of a heart in the last movie.
I think so too, but he was still young and didn't make any really life changing decisions yet.
What about Neville Longbottom?
I loved that character, how he was such a dork and clumsy.
He really ended up being a badass though towards the end of the series.
Yeah like how he stood up to lord voldemort.
That part of the movie was truly awe inspiring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seeing people like Neville and Luna develop in Dumbledore's army during the fifth movie is the best.
Yes, I love seeing all the minor characters in the army like Cho, Padma and Seamus.
Cho seems like a really sweet character.
It seems like Harry's really grown up when he finally kisses Cho.
I still like seeing Neville and Luna getting more confident platonically than the romantic relationships.
Everyone who watches the movie probably cheers for Neville as he gets stronger.
And when he kills the snake in the end of The Deathly Hallows..
Oh, that part is awesome.
You see him and Luna talking together in the end of the Deathly Hallows.
Maybe they get together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
After Dumbledore and Voldemort, who do you think was the most powerful wizard?
I'm going with Snape.  He went under cover that whole time and was never found.
Yeah that was amazing.  Probably the most well written part of the whole series.
And it shows you the true scope of Dumpledores genius.
That he masterminded the whole plot from the very beginning.
It does kind of bring into question what kind of man he is though.  He sacrificed himself but also a lot of others as well.
Yes, indeed he did.  It was for the greater good but who knows maybe there was a better way.
As powerful as he was, he might have been able to find a way to defeat Tom Riddle.  He was able to destroy horcuxes himself.
But with great difficulty, and Harry ended up a horcrux at the end.
Yeah, I guess you're right.  But he could have stopped Voldy before he went after Harry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Harry Potter movies?
Oh yes, I absolutely love those movies. I've read all of the books as well.
I haven't had a chance to read them all yet. Is the movie following the story line given in the books well?
More or less, even though there are some differences, and the book offers more details about the characters.
Which of the characters is your favorite?
My favorite is Hermione for sure. And Emma Watson does such an excellent job portraying her.
She is probably my favorite too, even though I love the character of Snape as well.
He's a very complex character for sure. It's interesting once you really get to learn a character's back story.
Yeah it can change your whole perception of the character. That definitely happened with Snape.
Yes, the flash back scenes from his past revealed a lot about what kind of a man he actually was and explained a lot of his actions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what was your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I would have to say that's a hard question.
True, they were all so good.
If I had to choose I would say the Sorcerer Stone was my favorite.
Oh wow yes. That was so good.
The first movie was just so magical and wonderous.
Ever wonder what would happen if Harry was sorted into Slytherin?
I have thought about that many times.
I guess we will never know.
Yeah maybe we can write some fan fiction and make it happen!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you happen to know something
Know what
Why they split the last book into two movies
I am not sure
I was just curious
I think so they would have to cut as little as possible
Well that is true it is a long book
Pretty much the reason
Its just a hassle to watch as its two movies
Its not to bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Harry Potter movie did you like the best?
I loved all of them.
If you had to choose, which one would you pick?
I would have to say, Deathly Hollows part 2.
That one is kind of sad.
It is. But it needed to be, they were growing up.
I was so sad when the Weasly twin died!
But it showed that war is not a happy thing.
I think you are right, I felt like I grew with the characters.
It was a sad, but fitting end to the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the final Harry Potter movie?
The fight scenes and special effects were crazy.
Plus Dumpedore and his master plot the whole time.
I liked the scene with Snape.
I know, he wasn't such a bad guy after all.
And maybe Tim Riddle wasn't as smart as he thought he was.
No he was, just so arrogant he couldn't see the forests through the trees.
I see, he thought Snape would abandon his love for more power.
And not everyone is like that.  And Voldy never understood love.
At the end I guess that was his undoing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Harry Potter book?
I love the Prisoner Of Azaban
Who is your favorite character in that book?
Serious Black
What do you like abour Serious?
I like how he turned out to be the good guy
Yes. Any other characters?
I liked Hermione in this one.
Why is that?
I loved her time changer
XXXXXXXXXXX
How powerful do you think Dumbledore really is?
Well, they've said a bunch of times in the movies that he's the most powerful wizard ever.
Yeah, but it doesn't seem like he does all that much.
What do you mean? He's done a bunch.
Maybe in the last few movies, but in the first few he seemed useless.
Well, true but I think that's because the first few movies were meant more for little kids.
That doesn't make sense though.
Agreed, but it's kinda how it is. The later movies got darker and he got more powerful.
Yeah, I agree. From the Voldemort/Dumbledore battle in Goblet of Fire it seems like his power ramped up exponentially.
That's my point, yeah till then he hadn't done much, after that he was unstoppable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?
Some of them - which is your favorite?
Tough to pick, but probably the first one.
Mine too. It's crazy how young they all look!
I know! You forget until you watch the recent ones where they're almost 10 years older.
They did a great job casting the Harry Potter movies - they really grow up with the characters.
It's so difficult to imagine anyone else playing any of those roles.
Which is an amazing achievement for child actors, really.
I read the books and visualized all 3 of the main characters looking exactly like that.
I always liked how true to the books the Harry Potter movies were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, I always thought Longbottom was a wimp until the last movie.
Dude, he totally owned that film.
Where did he find the bravery?
Who cares?  He looked great with that sword.
Most people look cool with a huge friggin' sword.
Right, but he cut off the snake's head like it was easy.
And screamed while doing it!
No kidding.  Total hero at that time.
I hope he gave the sword back at the end.
They wouldn't let him keep it since it was such a heirloom.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think they did great making Harry Potter into movies.
I disagree.
Why? What was so horrible about them?
The first two or three were fine. I saw number four and it was twisted. Nothing was making sense. It was just flashes of scenes. They weren't connected.
I thought it was good.
Yeah, but you never read the books. You don't know what they left out.
Like what?
Who drew the Marauders map? You've seen all the movies now, right? So who drew the map?
uhhh. I don't know. Did it ever say?
No, they didn't. The movies never said who created the map and that sucks
XXXXXXXXXXX
Harry Potter is one of those movie series you can just watch over and over again.
I have seen them, in whole, at least ten times over.
I am on my fourth re-watch.
What is your favorite scene in the franchise?
I like the bigger scenes, but there are a few subtle ones I think pay a fair homage to the films.
Then a subtle one, what is the most fitting subtle scene.
When Harry admits to Sirius his concerns about maybe being a part of Voldemort. There's a line where he says "I'm just so angry, all the time" .
I think it was very fitting to his personal experience, as well as being a teenager in general.
And Siruis is really shown as the family role Harry needed. Supportive and rewarding.
Yes, he comforts him after. Like a father, of an uncle should.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really love the first Harry Potter movie. It's my favorite.
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
Yes, that one. Did you see it?
I did, it's great. Daniel Radcliffe was so young but delivered a great performance.
I was shocked that Professor Quirrell was working with Voldemort.
I was too, I thought it was Professor Snape the whole time.
The graphics were great in the movie. I loved the scene with the Troll.
It was great. I was grossed out when Harry put his wand into the Troll's nose though.
Yeah that was disgusting. Imagine if that were real life.
That'd be so gross.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did Harry think Sirius was really going to do if he lived?
I don't think Harry even thought that far. He has delusions of grandeur.
Totally. Sirius was just a regular guy, not a white knight.
I guess to Harry everything was better than the Dursley's.
He really doesn't realize how good he had it there. I mean he got everything he needed plus the protection from his mother.
You're right. He never does seem truly grateful for them.
It could have been much worse.
I know. He could have lived with all those kids at the Weasley's.
Harry even eventually got his own room.
It was nice too. They eventually left him alone and let him do his thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies?
Yes, I like all of them except for The Chamber of Secrets
Me too, my favorite is The Order of the Phoenix.
Yea, I like the secret house they use in London.
It's funny when they all take the polyjuice potion to look like Harry.
Yes! I forget which movie that is in, I also like the Weasley's House.
Yea, I like the clock that Mrs. Weasley uses to keep track of everyone.
And the spells she uses for the dishes to clean themselves.
Also the flying car is cool!
Yea, I like that it lives in the Forbidden forest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite The Goblet of Fire.
Mad Eye for sure.
Yeah, even though it wasn't him?
Especially since it wasn't him.  I mean the guy impersonating him did such a perfect job he fooled everyone.
Except Harry, and the teachers at the end.
Yeah, just in a nick of time they figured him out.
I know, I love how close Voldy always is to getting Harry.
Yeah, always by a whisker.
It's what makes it such a good series.
Agreed, always has you in doubt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your least favorite Potter character.
Malfoy for sure.
That's a little obvious. Any non-villans?
No. I pretty much like them all. You?
I didn't like the Ron Weasley.
What?
He was such a whiner.
Ok. I'll give you that one.
Malfoy was way worse though.
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter Movie?
I liked the sixth one.
What did you like about that?
I liked the story of Tom Riddle.
He seemed like an innocent kid.
Yeah, he seemed independent and ambitious.
He stole the stuff at the orphanage. But kids tend to grow out of that.
He didn't play by the rules.
He really hated muggles.
He had a tragic story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sometimes I don't know how to feel about Dumbledore as a character. He was awfully manipulative.
Yeah, but he make sure Harry survived, didn't he?
He took a lot of unnecessary chances though. He also lied to everyone around him, especially Harry and Snape.
Well, he was trying to keep Voldemort from finding out about what they were doing, wasn't he?
I guess, but his methods seem really harsh, especially where Snape is concerned.
Lying to him about Harry having to die and all that?
Yes, not to mention forcing Snape to kill him so that Voldemort would believe that Snape was master of the Elder Wand.
Is that why he did it? I thought it was because he wanted Snape to take over at Hogwarts and protect the children.
Well, that was part of it. But like everything he did, he had multiple reasons.
Yeah, I guess he was pretty tricky.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you thoughts on harry potter films?
I love them like most people.
Do you have a favorite or most disliked character?
I admired Hermione Granger most.  I disliked malfoy most until he somewhat redeemed himself by the last film.
Ya then Malfoy's father was really the one to dislike. Hermione was a great character.
I guess they had a big open casting call and emma watson went and won the part.
Ya it would not have been the same without her.
Also saw an interview with Emma, they had a clip of ron, harry and hermione scene and she is mouthing the other's lines.
That is really funny. Must have been the first film.
It may have been a test schot even. But ya I guess Emma was just so excited to be in and knew all the lines for everyone!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished the Deathly Hallows, Part 2.
What'd you think of the ending?
It was so sad when Harry was walking to the forest to die, but there was one part that I really loved.
Which part is that?
When Malfoy's mother goes to Harry and asks if her son is alive or not.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that part. What else happened?
Harry nods really subtly and tells her that Draco is still alive. Then, she announces to the rest of the Death Eaters that he's dead.
What do you think they would've done to him if she said he was alive?
They probably would've killed him. Maybe with a knife or another weapon rather than just a spell.
Harry Potter really is the boy who lived. He survived the killing curse twice in his life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, Melanie and I are starting the Harry Potter series of movies. Care to join us?
Do you mean all of them?
Yes, we were going to watch the first one The Sorcerers Stone tonight?
There are a lot of movies but I could for sure be there to watch one at a time. That's a great idea!
Yes, and we are both going to dress as our idea of Hermoine.
That sounds fun, I can do that. Maybe we could switch characters for every movie.
That's a great idea. And make snacks to go along with the movie.
I can do that. What should I bring?
Well how about some kind of Halloween snack since it has that feast in the movie?
Great idea! I will make pumpkin cookies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite teacher?
Maganagall....Maggie Smith is my favorite acctreee.
Where you a fan of Umbridge or now?
Actually I was, I loved the scene with all the cat plates in her office.
What house would you want to be in?
Anything but Hufflepuff. haha
Whats the first thing Rob says to Hermione?
I'm Ron Weasley.
And what does Heromine Respond with?
Pleasure....still one of my favorite lines.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Harry potter sucks
Why do you even think that
Because it is so boring
How do you even form that opinion
Well because i watched the movies and they were boring
Did you start at the first one
Nah
Well that is why
Why?
You need to watch them in order duh
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always wondered why the Dursley's were always so terrible to Harry, any idea?
Well, they never wanted to take him in so there's that.
Yeah, but still, even if you don't want to do it, you don't need to treat him that way.
Well, it always seemed like Dumbledore kind of forced them to keep him.
Yeah, I know.
So, it makes some sense, they are forced to keep someone that represents magic in their house, of course they'll hate him.
So, Harry deserves to be miserable the entire time?
He doesn't deserve it, but where else could he go and be safe
I'm sure a million places, like the Weasleys?
Yeah, he could, but remember the protective spell requires him to go back to the Dursley's house once a summer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you think Haggrid and Madame Maxime got together after everything was settled?
Good question. I think we all just assumed Haggrid was still game keeper at Hogwarts.
Yeah, probably. How do you think the Fantasical Beasts tie in to that?
It would have been cool for Haggrid to meet Newt Scramander. I think they would have had a lot to talk about.
Yeah, that new movie was pretty good. I'm not sure how I feel about the Cursed Child.
It sounded a little to far off base for me. Like the description of Harry sounded completely out of character.
I thought so too, but I'll probably still go see it. I love the Harry Potter movies though they are different from the books.
Yeah, it's a different vibe but still good.
They did an excellent job with special effects.
Considering how vivid the descriptions are in the book and how my imagination wandered...they did great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Finally caught up on Harry Potter yesterday!
How exciting! What did you think?
It was really emotional.
Yeah it can be. Who was your favorite?
I really loved all of the Weasleys, there were so many of them and there was a lot of growth.
Honestly, I loved the twins and I was so sad when Fred died.
Me too! I couldn't stop crying.
I felt so bad for George.
And Molly. Such a hard time for a mom.
But she was so badass in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go to Hogwarts!
Well we passed eleven and it's fictional but we could watch the movies if you want.
Very true. But I still wish it was real.
Me too, I heard a joke about people who've read the books and watched the movies are Purebloods.
Oh that is funny, so people who only read the books are Half-bloods?
Hilarious! Let's call the people who only watch the movies muggles.
What should we call people who've never done either of them?
How about Deatheaters? They are people that just suck the happiness out of life!
That is way too funny. So what about dumb people who hate Harry Potter all together?
Let's call them The Dursleys!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies
Yes I have and I love them. Have you.
Yes and I loved the fact that the kids had such good chemistry.
That's really important, that can make or break a  movie. Have you ever had a marathon?
Yes me and my kids have Harry Potter marathons all the time.
You know what adds to the fun? Making butterbeer and popcorn to watch with it.
You can actually make butterbeer? The same as it's described in the movie?
Yes there's a recipe on line. It contains butterscotch, really good.
That sounds good, I know my kids would love that.
Mine flip out over it. We can't watch Harry Potter anymore unless there's butterbeer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You don't like Hedwig? Are you serious?
Well she's kind of useless.
She's literally the cutest animal in the entire show.
Cute doesn't equal useful though.
True, but she delivers his letters and brings presents from his friends...
And other things, yes. But still she's useless.
You are really going to need to explain yourself better.
She just doesn't do much, I mean Hermione's cat does more than Hedwig.
Crookshanks? If you mean being an overall menace, then sure you're right.
Hedwig just didn't do much for me, I was sad she died in the last movie though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone with the Symphony?
Yes.  I'm looking forward to the first glimpse of Hogwarts with a live orchestra.
I don't know.  I find the orchestra distracting.
I saw Back to the Future with live orchestra and it made it so much better.
Well, I never did see any of the Harry Potter films at the theater.  That would be a similar experience.
The special effects are even better in the theater.
I love it when they fly on brooms.
My favorite part are the spells.
I like in the first one when Hermoine corrects them on that levitation spell.
Yeah!  That part cracks me up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Harry Potter character?
I liked Luna.
She definitely had personality.
I think she was a good role model for young people.
She was always marching to a different beat.
I think that was her strength, though, that she accepted her role in society with poise.
Her upbringing had to be odd, without a mom and with an oddball dad.
I imagine she was happy enough, even if she lived her life mostly in fantasy.
I think Rowling used her to exemplify being true to yourself.
Yes, but I would like to have seen her stand up for herself to the bullies sometimes instead of just accepting it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I finally saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two!
Finally! I mean, really, it was about time.
It was so great. It really brought the books to life for me.
I think it is interesting how the movies started so light and blissful and got so dark before culminating in Deathly Hallows.
I know, it is like the movie content matured with the age of the actors.
Well, did you like the older or newer movies?
That is a tough question.
How so?
I liked them all, but for different reasons.
I guess I cannot really pick a favorite either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you feel when at the end of the one movie happened
What when they almost lost
Yeah i was expecting them to lose
Same but then griffindor got the extra points
Then they clutched the win and saved the day
Yeah i was on the edge of my set
Dumbledore is such a nice guy
I know right
He is like the father harry never had
Pretty much what he is set up to be
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Goblet of Fire?
It was really good.  These movies seem to get better and better with each one.
Yeah, the fight scenes and action took a big step forward.
It was funny to watch the guys go crazy over asking girls out too.  Glad I'm not a teen anymore.
Yeah, and lets not forget the maze at the end.
Who would have expected that lead to a port key?
I know right?  And to the worst possible place.
I know, I felt bad for Cedric.  But that fight with Voldemort was pretty cool.
I know right?  It was one of the best parts.
Especially when Peter cut off his own hand.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Chamber of Secrets?
Yes I have, it was pretty good.
I agree, big improvement over the first, and a lot more mature.
Yeah, I liked the fight scene at the end.  And how it seems that Vodly is destined to come back.
I know what you mean.  And that book, how innocent people can just be controlled by Voldy.
And the part about parcil mouths.  It was cool how only a select few can speak to snakes.
That was one of Voldemort's best showings at the end.  Seems he got much closer to victory the second time around.
Yes, to see him young, and get a glimpse of his planning abilities.
I also liked the Griffendore sword.
Yeah, it was pretty cool.  Gave a warm feeling to the end as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Harry Potter character?
I think Sirius Black was my favorite.
Yeah, he was a good guy.
A good guy? Sirius was fantastic!
I don't know, I thought he was irresponsible and wouldn't have been a good guardian for Harry.
Of course he was irresponsible! He spent all of his adulthood in Azkaban.
But he treated Harry like he was his friend, not his godparent.
I think that's because he thought of Harry like he did James, because they were so similar.
He still was irresponsible as a godfather.
I think Sirius did the best he could, considering his circumstances - his best friend was killed and he was blamed for it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?
Of course!  My favorite is The Goblet of Fire.
Really?  Why?
Well, I think it was the most adventurous.  It was action paced, but kept itself grounded in the familiar territory of the kids at school.
I guess I understand that.  I really like The Order of the Phoenix.
Why?
The exact opposite of your reason--it gets the movie away from school and more into the actual world of wizardry.
Huh.  I understand.
I like them all, I mean.  But that one is my favorite.
I like them all too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which book is your favorite of the Harry Potter?
I loved book six.
You liked the one where Dumbledore dies?
It had a lot of dramatic effect. There was a lot of answers to questions, too.
Yes, I always thought Dumbledore should have gotten more of a send-off.
You're right, Aragorn and Dobby both got more page time than he did.
He had a legacy to live on, neither Dobby or the spider did.
I guess in a way, Dumbledore continues on in the painting.
I was always confused about whether they were ghosts or just magically imbued with their essence.
I don't think there is a solid answer, but I don't think Dumbledore became a ghost.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Harry Potter character?
Ginny Weasley, definitely.
Really? I didn't feel like she did anything at all in the movies!
Maybe not in the movies, but in the books she's a hilarious character.
I can't picture that at all.
She's also a great Quidditch player, but they don't show her playing Quidditch at all in the movies.
I didn't even know that she played Quidditch!
Absolutely she did! After Hogwarts, she even went on to play Quidditch professionally!
Wow, what position did she play?
Ginny was a Chaser, I believe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like Harry Potter?
Yeah sure.
Me too.
Do you have a character that you hate?
Interesting question.
Take your time.
I hated that principal type female character.
Umbridge, yeah she was easy to hate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm glad Harry and Ginny got together at the end.
He was supposed to be with Herminone.
Hermione loved Ron.
No. She settled for Ron. She was in love with Harry.
Where did you get that from?
Harry was the star of the book. Harry was "the Boy who lived". Who wouldn't love him?
Just because someone's a hero, doesn't mean people automatically love them.
No, but look at everything they went through together. It wasn't Harry and Ron. It wasn't Hermione and Ron. It was always Harry and Hermione.
I think they saw each more as brother and sister.
I don't care. Harry and Hermione belonged together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you heard of Harry Potter?
... you can't be serious right now can you?
I'm so Sirius my last name is black. Hahaha.
Wow... just... wow.  I didn't know you were a potter fan,  what is your favorite book?
I really enjoyed the prizoner of azkaban.
My favorite book was the goblet of fire. I also liked the movie adaptation because I'm a big robert Pattenson fan.
Meh, he's ok I guess.  Rupert grint is my faster actor in the movies.
Yeah he's good,  that reminds me of the scene in the half blood prince where Ron drinks the love potion.  SO FUNNY!
Wait,  no spoilers! I'm only up to the order of the Phoenix!!
Oops, sorry pal.  Better get back to reading!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Harry Potter film?
I really enjoy the Sorcerer's Stone
Really? Why's that?
Because! Its the first in the series and it begins it all.
Very true, if it wasn't for that first movie, we wouldn't have been able to see any of the rest.
Sure but at least there was still the books.
Yea, but I personally prefer movies.
Why? So many people like the books more.
Because through the movies you can see all the magic and action. It's amazing.
Well sure, the books you kinda have to use your imagination.
XXXXXXXXXXX
For the longest time, I had an aversion to the Harry Potter movies even though I had not seen one film.
You should watch the series.  They are very well done.
I actually finished up the series last night and I enjoyed it.  All the movies were well done.
Which movie did you like the most?
Probably, Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.  I enjoyed the series when the characters were younger and more naive about the world.
I am different.  I liked when they were older and the movies were a bit more darker.
Which movie was your favorite?
Probably Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.  The dementors were spooky.
The tone of that whole film was very dark to me.  Even the colors used in the film seem to be more muted.
I think there is more at stake in the later films.  That is why I like them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I think I have figured out why in the Harry Potter movies, Snape was so hard on Neville Longbottom.
Because he was pals with Harry?
Not just that, there is way more. He was not as mean to Harry's other pals, at least not as mean as he was to Neville.
Then why?
Because, if Voldermort would have targeted the Longbottoms, his mom and dad, instead of the Potters, Lily might still be alive.
What! Since, either family would fit the criteria to end him.
Yes. So he blamed Harry, and Neville. Neville to a lesser extent.
That is why he always took his points away.
And embarrassed him.  He did not even have the excuse he was trying to convince Voldermort by it either.
Snape was a real piece of work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Harry Potter movies have you watched?
Five, I think. I haven't watched all of them.
Some are better than others. What would you say is the most memorable thing about all of them?
"Snape Kills Dumbledore."
I agree! Harry Potter has lots of memborable things, but that one tops all!
I particularly like the scenes where he's flying on the broom.
That one. Was that from the first movie?
Yes, I think so.
Which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?
"Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone."
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Ron in the Harry Potter movies?
I think he's a tool.
No!  He's awesome!  He introduces Harry to the wizarding world.
He is just a patsy who gets dragged into dangerous situations.
But he saves them by playing wizards chess!
That's one instance. He's so unimportant that they can write him out of half of the last movie.
But I miss him when he's gone!
And why would Hermonine MARRY him? She can do so much better.
But they love each other!  It's a timeless love!
It's a trite love.  She'd be better off with a dentist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot believe they are making another movie
Why not
I just want them to stop
But the movies are fun
They are butchering the books
They are two separate mediums though
Still they are a disgrace
I like both of them myself
Good for you
Geeze cannot handle another opinion
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like about Diagon Alley?
I love that it's basically right next to the Muggle world, but invisible.
I kinda like that the bar is the secret entrance.
Well, it's not the only entrance.
What other entrance is there?
The floo network!
Oh, right! Harry went to that creepy shop accidentally that way.
Yes! I just like that the magic folk have their own little city.
With a ton of cool shops too, what's your favorite shop?
The Weasley brothers' shop of course!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What house would you be?
Gryffindor for sure.
I don't think you're couragoues enough for them.  You seem more Hufflepuff to me.
Whatever, dude.  Hufflepuff is weak.
They're not all wussies.  That guy that died getting the goblet was amazing.
He's the rare exception.  Most Hufflepuff are wussies.
Well, in that case, most Gryffindor are untrusting.
Now you're just making things up.
Maybe you should have been Slytherin.
The sorting hat never lies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Harry Potter movies?
No. Should I?
Yes! There's action and magic and drama and a bunch of other stuff. It's great.
Sounds nice. Maybe I'll check it out.
You should. You like Alan Rickman, right?
Yeah, he's in the series?
Yeah, he plays Snape. You might or might not like his character.
Oh yeah? Why not?
Watch the movies for yourself and see! Spoilers, or maybe not spoilers, but there's a plot twist involving him in The Half-Blood Prince if I remember correctly.
Alright, I'll keep an eye out for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it just me or is Luna crazy?
Well, her dad's a nutcase.
I know, but she could have been a bit more sane.
Hard to be sane when you're dad is a complete loon.
I did like the actress' performance though.
Yeah, she did a good job of just looking around quite a bit bewildered.
I wish she would have been in the last movie more.
Yeah, I guess they had too much to wrap up.
Didn't she end of marrying someone at Hogwarts?
I'm not sure to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the last Harry Potter movie?
It was pretty cool.
I liked the part where Voldemort finds the elder wand.
Yeah, that was cooler than the last battle.
It was so creepy.
They tried to bring back some humanity to Tom Riddle.
I'm not sure about the Harry and Voldemort duel.
Why?
It seemed like they were flying around as black smoke a lot.
Voldemort can fly without a broom.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoyed when they shared Snape's backstory.
Ya I liked that too I didn't realize he had a crush on Harry's mom.
Ya and he made it his goal to to protect her.
Once you see that part it really gives you a new perspective on Snape.
I totally agree. I started to question where his loyalty was up until then.
So did I but I felt the backstory really answers a lot of the questions I had.
I wish Harry Potter had gotten to know more about Snape while he was alive.
Ya I agree if Snape hadn't of been living a double life.
Ya I'm sure it was difficult for him to try and play two sides with Voldemort.
Ya I think that's a good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still think he is adorable
Who
Dobby the way they did him in the movies
I guess he looks cool
No he is freaking adorable
Okay if you say so
I know so
Why though
Well the design is perfect and his voice actor got it right
Well he did play it well
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so sad
Why
Because two of the best harry potter actors have died
Which ones
The one who played dumbledore and snape
I thought only one died
No they both are dead now
That is sad
I know right
Such a shame
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch harry potter?
Yes, i love the movies
Me too
My favorite character is dumblerdore
Hes cool, i love ron
Hes good, i like him too
You kinda have to feel bad for him
Thats true
I like his brothers
They are funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Harry Potter is the last one.
It is divided up right?
Yes, I like part 2.
It is very good
The battle with Voldemort is legendary.
I love it. It is so fast paced.
I like how Harry dies but comes back.
He had the infinity stone.
The final fight is cool.
The wand was his all along.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban
Is that his third year?
Yes
I think its cool they are all afraid of this crazy killer
And it turns out to be his uncle
Exactly
And he's actually pretty cool
Yep, not crazy
Im glad harry found him
Or he found harry
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Harry Potter books are some of my favorites, though I really like the movies as well.
You didn't think they deviated too much from the source material?
No, not at all!
Well, they did change a few things.
Yeah, but that's going to happen with any screen adaptation. I think they stayed very true to the story's overall theme.
You mean love triumphing over hate and all that?
Yeah, that was really the most important part, you know?
I can see that. I just wish a few of the scenes hadn't been cut out.
True, but you never know. They might be released on extended editions someday.
I hope so!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite Snape moments?
I loved his attitude when being questioned by that lady from the ministry.
Yeah, he was clearly unimpressed and let her know it.
And later when we find out he was saving Harry during that quiddich match.
Or how about when he was a kid talking to Lilly.
I know, that was emotional.  It showed he really was a person under that anger.
I loved when he showed his memory of being part of that master plan to kill Voldemort.
Who would of thought he was part of a master plan?
Yeah, the whole time we thought he was bad.
Well he was, until Voldy killed someone he loved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
Oh, that's a tough one! They are all amazing in their own way.
Come on, you have to pick one.
Well, the earlier ones are more kid-like, and the later ones get progressively darker.
That didn't answer my question, haha.
Well, it depends on my mood. If I want something light I would pick Sorcerer's Stone.
I get that, but say you have to pick one and only one, what is your answer.
Fine, okay then I would have to pick Goblet of Fire.
Why Goblet?
Well, it is the turning point in the movies/books. Things get serious and when Voldemort comes back and Dumbledore sees him the story actually begins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you were a student at Hogwarts what would you pick for a pet.
Probably a cat.
Gross!
Huh!
Sorry, I'm alergic. Visceral response!
So what would you pick.
I'd like to have an owl.
That would be pretty cool to be able to send messages.
Seems a little outdated.
Yeah, don't they have email at that school.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's Harry Potter weekend, are you going to watch?
Oh yeah, definitely. I really love Neville.
Neville! Out of everyone at Hogwarts, you like Neville. I bet you are going to tell me you like Luna too, huh?
What is wrong with that? Neville got so brave at the end standing up to Voldemort.
He did, he really grew as a character. My favorite is the Weasley's mom!
Oh yeah! I just loved that way she defended Ginny from Bellatrix.
Yeah, that fight scene was so powerful. I really loved it. I can't wait to watch now.
I know I'm so excited. I don't think I'm leaving my couch.
Harry Potter here I come!
Don't forget those tissues, Dumbledore dying is very sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is better the first Dumbledore or the second?
Richard Harris was my favorite. The other guy was okay but Ian McKellan would have done a great job too.
You're just saying that because of his role in Lord of the Rings. He did have that Dumbledore quality.
Agreed but it's not that. His eyes twinkle in the way I imagine Dumbledore's would also.
Yeah, he could have easily pulled that off. Makes you wonder about the choice for Gilderoy Lockhart. I heard Hugh Jackman....
Yeah, he's just cheesy enough. I think he would have been better. Me too.
McGonnagal was a good choice.
Yeah, can't believe that is Grandmama from Downton Abbey!
I know but she still has that quality about her.
Yes, you definitely want to stay on her good side. She's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey friend! Do you think the Harry Potter movies are as good as the books?
At times, sure. My favorite movie was the fourth one, because of the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the visiting wizarding schools.
I enjoyed that one, too! If you could go to one of the schools, which would you pick?
I'd probably choose Durmstrang. It seems a little darker than the others, a little like wizarding school in Russia.
Plus the name is a smart pun on the "sturm und drang" music and literary aesthetic. Which school uniforms were your favorite in the films?
I enjoyed the Beauxbatons blue uniforms, but it's hard to go wrong with the classic Hogwarts robes with house crests.
What did you think about the last book being split into two movies?
I partly thought it was a little opportunistic, but for me the last movies were the most emotionally intense because I never finished the book so all the action was actually a surprise.
Wow, you really never finished the book? So what was the most emotional part of the final films?
I think it had already been spoiled, but Dobby's death was definitely the toughest part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We had a Harry Potter movie marathon this weekend.
That sounds like it was fun.
It was and it was relaxing too.
I need to do more of that kind of binge watching.
It makes all of the movies make sense when you watch them in order.
I think that is so true.
I love this series because the story is complex.
I think it works well with following Harry's Hogwart years.
Yes that takes talent to record them and make the actors seem like not a lot has passed.
I imagine that they all became very close when recording the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite class in the Harry Potter movies?
Mine is divination, what's yours?
Potions. I love cooking and chemistry sets so that would be right up my alley.
Yeah if you didn't turn yourself into a frog first.
That's why paying attention is so important. I'd have loved all the classes to be truthful.
Same here. I love the way they make you familiar with the inner workings of the school throughout the series.
Yes I believe that's part of its appeal. I want to visit the Harry Potter world at Universal Studios.
Oh me too, I've been wanting to go since before they opened.
I heard they really stuck to the movie, and included all the little details in the movie that fans would love.
We'll get there one day, in the meantime we can continue to watch Harry Potter marathons for now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the romance side of the Harry Potter movies?
The whole Hermoine and Ron thing?
Among others, yes.
I think she should have ended up with Harry.
Like when they danced at the Yule ball?
Yep. They were more equals.
But Ron loved her.
Ron was an idiot. In the last two, he left her and Harry to fend for themselves.
But, he was under the influence of the Horicrux.
Harry was one, but he never left his friends hanging like Ron.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Harry Potter movies?
I loved the books and the movies are pretty good also.
Do you like the acting?
Snape is great and so is Daniel as Harry.
I agree. Snape couldn't be better.
He really has the character down.
I think the casting people did a great job.
They picked great actors.
What do you think of Emma Watson?
I love her. She's in other great movies as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What death is the saddest do you think?
Dumbledore in Half-Blood Prince! I hated Snape for doing that!
I hated him too but then he was actually a good guy!
I wasn't expecting him to be good! I was ready to hate him!
Or what about when Hedwig was killed and fell from the sky?
That was so sad too. Harry was so upset, it was hard to watch.
Or Lupin and Tonks when they just had a baby?
At least he got to grow up not having Voldemort in his life!
Yes that is one good thing!
And Harry can take care of him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is you favorite  McGonagall moment in the last two movies?
When her and Snape duke it out in Deatlhy Hollows part two.
Just about everything she does in that one is awesome.
When she and Snape have the battle in the main hall, it is equal parts funny and sad.
When she sayd " I always wanted to use that spell" after she hits him with a good one, I love that scene.
It showed that she was a powerful witch, but still cool and sweet about it.
They hinted the whole series she was. But she cared more about kids than being known for her power.
That scene just cemented it. That she did not really like Snape.
I do not think anyone but Lily and Dumbledore ever actually liked Snape before he died.
And Lily stopped liking him pretty soon after she found out he was not so nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite harry potter character?
Hermoine granger
How come?
She so smart and she makes herself a wizard
True that a lot of determination
Exactly, what about you?
Harry
Why?
Because he is harry potter
Of course
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you going to watch the Harry Potter weekend marathon?
I totally am!
I'm still sad about Snape's death in movie and real life.
Me too, Snape was a great character.
I always thought he was a dark character, but he had good in him.
So true, as the movies progressed we saw more about his struggles.
Exactly!
And by the Half blood Prince we saw why he seems to dislike Harry.
That was so sad that he was in love with Lily Potter but she didn't feel the same.
God I love these movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy the Harry Potter movies?
Yes there are great,  you?
Yes they are the best wizard movies
I love how they include other things too
Like what?
Like ghosts, and giants, and elves
Oh yea,  that is pretty cool
It is
They are great family movies
Yes they are
XXXXXXXXXXX
how did you like harry potter?
i loved the books but didnt care for the movies
i loved both of them.
which did you like the best
i liked the half blood prince.
what a surprise it was when you reach the end.
snape is the half blood prince.
he is such a great character.
yes, he is my favorite now.
and he died for the cause
XXXXXXXXXXX
Severus Snape as a character absolutely disgusts me.
What! Why?
Because he unapologetically abused his students for years.
But he loved Lily though! He saved Harry because of his love for her!
Yes, because of a creepy obsession with a woman whom he called the equivalent of a racial slur.
He was under stress at the time! And he protected Harry to try and make it up to her!
He made it up to the love of his life by treating her son like subhuman garbage for seven years?
...Well when you put it like that...
Exactly. I acknowledge that Snape saved a lot of people, Harry included, by doing what he did, but that does not absolve him of a lifetime of being an abuser.
I think I need to reread the series now...
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally got my kids to watch some of the Harry Potter movies!
Oh really, what did they think of them?
Well the youngest fell asleep during the first movie. The oldest stayed up almost all night with me watching two of them.
What did she think of them?
She loved them, she wanted to know what happened to the boy with the "scarf on his head and the man with no nose."
That's funny, you've got her addicted to them then?
Yeah, you can say that, she keeps asking me to watch more of them.
Good job, starting her out young, now you need to plan a movie night and have her watch the rest!
Oh I know, she will be so excited to watch them, pop corn and movie night with Mommy!
Sounds like fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which was your favorite Harry Potter film?
My favorite was the original, Sorceror's Stone.
I liked that for the most part it kept to the story line.
Sure it helped that it was the shortest book so that made it easier.
Yes, they didn't need to cut out too many parts.
That was one thing that bugged me about some of the other films, especially Deathly Hollows.
That film while it was long, did miss a lot of what was in the book.
That is one thing I cannot stand. I can't believe sometimes that authors would go along with scripts sometimes.
Yes you would think that Rowling would have objected to some changes.
Maybe yes and maybe no. She sure got enough money for it though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the whole harry potter series?
Yes ive watched all 8 movies
Did you like them?
Yes i wish they never ended
I loved the sorcerers stone
Yes i like the mirror showed him that it was in his pocket
And then it was suddenly there
That was really cool
I wish magic like that was real
Me too, I want to go to Hogwarts
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
I like at the end when they're playing on the giant chess board.
I agree. I also like when they have to get past Fluffy, the three-headed guard dog.
I love the whole ending scene of the movie because it shows how well Harry, Ron and Hermione can work together.
What's your least favorite part of the movie?
I don't like when Harry is in the Forbidden Forest and sees somebody drinking the Unicorn's blood.
Don't we later figure out that Professor Quirrell is drinking the blood to sustain Voldemort?
Yes, that's right. That part of the movie always used to scare me.
When I was younger, the part of the movie that scared me was when Hagrid got to the island where Harry was staying with the Dursleys to tell him he was a wizard.
I love when all of the letters come to Harry's house. I always thought it was funny that he tried to jump and catch one instead of grabbing one off of the floor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Hogwarts instructor?
Snape.
Really, why?
One of my favorite actors.
Remind me who that is.
Allan Rickman.
What else was he in?
He was the bad guy in the first Die Hard.
Oh, yeah!
Awesom actor!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, can we talk about how bad the Burrow burning scene was in Half-Blood Prince?
I mean, I get what they were going for, they wanted to add something darker to offset all the wacky forced high school romance, right?
Exactly, I think they could've done that better if they, you know, actually did stuff from the books. Just take Hannah out of class one day because her mother died, that actress had done a couple of Harry Potter movies, that would've been fine!
I think it's a part of movie-language's whole "Show, don't tell" thing.
But then why have Bellatrix and Fenrir, a known murderer and a known cannibal, show up if they weren't going to murder and/or eat anyone?
That's a good point, they only sent out Stunning Charms, didn't they?
Maybe, I couldn't tell. All spells look the same in the movies.
And when they burned down the Burrow, it was back and fine again in the next movie.
Because they established earlier that there's a spell that can fix things earlier in Half-Blood Prince, so there was no reason to worry in the first place.
Wow, you're right, that actually accomplished nothing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate that they are changing actors
What is
In the new harry potter movie some of the actors are being changed
They are?
Yeah the old ones were perfect for the part
But are they not getting old
Maybe
Well they need more age appropriate actors
Nah just an excuse
Think logically please
XXXXXXXXXXX
I had a Harry Potter movie marathon the other day.
Aren't those movies amazing?!
Yes! things you don't even realize were important are revealed to big deals later.
Oh yes, like the whole time you don't even realize that Dumbledore has the elder wand ( A Deathly Hollow)
Exactly, it's like everything connects in the end.
Right, look at how Sirius was so important to Harry and trying to stop Voldemort from rising when the whole time his own brother had actually started his own mission to stop him long ago.
I just wish they would've showed more of Voldemort's background, like the things that happened with his family history .
Yeah, seeing how his mother tricked the muggle Tom Riddle into loving her with a love potion and resulting into Tom Marvel Riddle ( Voldemort ) being born and implied that since he was conceived under a love spell he can't love would've been pretty informative.
But the best part of the movies is Snape-Alan Rickman.
Absolutely, he was exactly how you could imaging Snape. He was perfect, and that scene of him dying in the boathouse makes me cry every single time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any Harry Potter movies?
Of course, I am a huge fan!
Oh sweet! Me too. Which movie is your favorite?
I would probably have to say Prisoner of Azkaban.
That's definitely a good one. Are you a big Sirius Black fan?
No. I mean I like him, but I really like Lupin.
Lupin is a great guy. Is he your favorite part of the movie?
I'm not sure. He's one of them anyway. I love the scene when they are practicing fighting Boggarts.
Yeah really. That one is funny. Snape dressed up as Neville's grandma had me laughing so hard.
Ha! "Riddikulus" and Draco says "This class is ridiculous." Too funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Snap is awful. I am sorry, the Harry Potter fans are nuts, in the movies he was awful.
How do you figure that? He was a amazing!
He mentally tortured Harry and all his friends, for one.
But he was just trying to teach him a lesson.
No, he hated the kid's dad. He was an adult, jeez.
He also wanted it to look like he hated him, to Voldmort.
Sure, in the last couple movies. But, he did not have to be evil to the kid.
He loved Harry's mom.
Right, but was all mad she chose another guy. So he took it out on Harry.
But, in his dying breath he redeemed himself!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen the Harry Potter movies, right? What did you think of the final one?
I loved it. I wish they would have been able to include every scene though.
I know, me too. That would have made the film too long, though.
There is a scene I wished they'd left out; Harry breaking the Elder Wand.
Oh I wished they left that too! I'm just going to pretend that he repaired his wand first off screen.
That would make more sense than him keeping Draco's wand.
You think he would keep Draco's wand, or would he get a new one? If he didn't fix his wand, that is.
Well he did win it from him. The wand changed its alliance to Harry.
That does make sense. I'm still going to pretend that he fixed his wand first.
Whatever works for you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, something is bothering me about Neville, maybe you can help.
Sure, what's up?
So, if Harry died or wasn't around, Neville would be the one to fight the Dark Lord, correct?
Well, it seems to be so in the books, yes.
So, is Neville being weak in the first few books a sign that Voldemort chose incorrectly?
What do you mean chose?
Well, Voldemort chose Harry the moment he killed his parents and left him with a scar.
Right, but that didn't really affect Neville did it?
It did actually. If that hadn't happened, if Harry didn't match the criteria, he would have chosen Neville.
So, would Neville be as powerful as Harry if he'd been selected? I honestly have no idea
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Are you familiar with the Harry Potter world?
Yeah sure.
Who is your favorite character?
I really like Hagrid.
Hah that is cool.
What about you?
I like harry of course.
okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the last Harry Potter movie?  Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2.
Yes, I've seen those.
Did you like it?
Not really.  I'm generally a fan of Harry Potter, but I didn't like the Deathly Hallows much.
Why didn't you like it?
It seemed too serious.  The children had grown up and the feel of the movie changed in a negative way.
So you're a fan of the earlier movies?
Absolutely.  I really enjoy every other Harry Potter movie.
Which one would you say is your favorite?
That's a tough decision to make because they are all really good.  I suppose the Goblet of Fire would be my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Voldemort try to kill Harry?
Yes, when he was a baby.
How'd he survive?
his mother saved him by sacrificing herself.
Oh wow. She loved him.
Yes, the spell rebound.
What happened then?
Voldemort was destroyed.
How'd he keep on?
His soul latched onto harry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?
I loved the part where they were learning how to stop dementors.
Yeah, that was fun.  Brought a little bit of light hardheartedness.
Plus dementers are pretty cool.  With their long robes and everything.
I also like the fact that you need to eat chocolate to counter act the effects.
Yeah, all I need is more chocolate.
The funniest part was Snape in the dress.
That was classic.
It just went to show how good of a teacher Lupin was.
Yeah, more hands on than others.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, here's one thing that bugs me about the Harry Potter movies compared to the books...
What's that?
There's several that happen in the films that, unless you've read the books, just do not make ANY sense.
What's a good example?
Okay, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix they all form this secret group called Dumbledore's Army and Hermione has the kids sign their names to a sheet of parchment.  Now, in the book she does this because she's put a curse on the paper.
A curse?
Yeah, something, anyone who tells anybody about the club will burst out in painful sore and whatnot, which is exactly what happens.  but in the movie it makes NO sense for her to do this.
Yeah, right, it just gives the bad guys a convenient list of everyone's who's involved in the group.
Exactly!  So there was no reason about all her for to do that. Plus, they changed who had told about the club (and why) so the whole thing is moot anyhow.
Yeah, they had it be Chang in the film and they had drugged her with that truth potion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Heard you finally finished watching Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire. What did you think?
I think the movies are starting to get a little too far removed from the books. What did you think?
Yeah I thought so too, but the actors are all great. So what can we do?
My point exactly! Emma Watson and Katie Leung were my favorites.
Seeing the visuals have really reinforced the book imagery for me. It's kind of hard to picture faces and places you've never been to before.
Yep, especially the costumes. It's also hard to imagine the magical creatures J.K. Rowling dreamed up.
I also liked the intensity of Voldemort coming back to life. It's harder to get scared reading a book.
The comedy was funnier too. Ron's dress robes were especially hilarious.
So when you gonna watch number Order of The Phoenix? Anytime soon?
I was thinking of buying all eight movies on Blu-ray and maybe marathon it this weekend. Come over if you want, it's supposed to make more sense watching them all back-to-back-to-back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's hard to beleive that Snape was a good guy that whole time.
I agree. He seemed like such a creep!
But he loved Lilly.
Huh?
Harry's mom.
Oh, yeah.
I really did like that plot twist.
Very fun, indeed!
I wonder what would have happened if Snape an Harry's mom got together instead.
Harry Snape?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched all of the Harry Potter movies for like, the 10th time.
Yea! I've probably watched them like 20 times. Which one is your favorite?
Hmm, I don't know, the first one is so classic and I love the original Dumbledore actor.
I know, he was so much more like the book character. But I think the last two movies are awesome.
Yeah, they did an amazing job. I feel like I'm one of the characters when I watch it.
Totally. I think the hardest to watch is the Order of the Phoenix because of Dolores Umbridge.
Ugh yes. The cats!! And all of the new rules...
But Fred and George were hilarious in that one. The fireworks and flying through the testing hall was epic.
I know! I love Fred and George!
Me too, they're hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi.
Do you like Harry Potter?
Yeah sure.
I love all the movies.
Which one was your favorite movie?
I liked the last two.
They were really well done I will say.
They tied the series up nicely.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of The Prisoner of Azkaban?
I thought it was pretty cool to start putting things like werewolves in there.
I know, too bad for that Professor Lupin though.  He was awesome.
Yeah, very powerful and pretty good with the kids as well.  He would have taught them well.
I didn't expect Scabbers to be Peter Petigrew the whole time.
I know, how fitting he was a rat.
Also that Serious Black was a good guy.  They put some good plot twist in there.
I agree, he's a good character too.
One of the best ones.  And best friends with Harry's father.
Yeah, him, Lupin, and that rat Peter.  I hate him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched all the Harry Potter movies yet?
Yes, I finally finished and I'm so sad there are no more!
Which one was your favorite?
Goblet of Fire! So much happened and poor Cedric.
Oh gosh I cried so much when he died.
He didn't deserve that! Voldemort is horrible!
I know right? So is Bellatrix though!
When she killed Sirius I almost died!
I cried for like 5 days!
Harry Potter is awesome though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever have the thought that maybe Snape was a good guy?
I never once thought that. I was taken by surprise.
Me too. It made me kind of sad that he was given such a bad rap and he was helping the whole time.
I know and the fact that he'd been in love with Harry's  mother and was teased in school made you really feel for him.
I know that was sad. It explains how he felt towards Harry.
I agree. It doesn't excuse his attitude but he'd really been done bad.
I love Alan Rickman. Anytime I see him in any role I can only think of him as Snape.
Me too! I think he was born to play that role.
You're right about that. I would have actually loved to take his Defense Against the Dark Arts class.
It sounds like it would have been the most interesting of them all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was an adult when I finally seen Harry Potter.
What did you think of the movies?
To be honest, I thought they made no sense.
What! How do you think that?
All the adults are insane. Especially the old wizard, principal guy.
Are you referring to the great Albus Dumbledore?
Yes, old wizard guy. He was an awful person. I mean he sent the kids into the forbidden woods. To pretty much die.
It was like detention.
Right, but more or less alone, with no help. They could have been killed at any moment.
But, he was the best head master. He loved Harry as a son.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Deathly Hollows part one or two better, in the Harry Potter franchise?
Part two, for sure.
Why is that?
The music was haunting and the scenes were quite somber, with the dementors surrounding Hogwarts and Snape silently watching the students in their marching formation
It really set a tone for the whole movie.
It showed the state of the Wizarding world at the time.
So desperate, that kids were the first and last line of defense.
I think it was a really good abstract of coming of age.
For more than just Harry too.
Right. For the whole magic world, the coming to terms with the fact they were not as capable as they thought.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really liked when Harry got that invisibility cloack for his birthday
Me too, it was perfect for his scemes
Yes it was and he got the maurderers map
He was unstoppable
But he still managed to get himself into trouble
Thats very true
But less with the cloak and the map
True
I love watching him sneak out
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
So why do you think the directors chose to split the Deathly Hallows book into two separate movies?
I think it's because so much happens in the book that they wanted to try to fit everything in.
Do you have a favorite movie between the two?
I think I like the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 a little bit better. There's more action.
I'm on the opposite side. I like Part 1 a little bit more.
Oh yeah? Why is that?
I think there's a lot of character development, and there's a great scene when Harry and Hermione are dancing together in the tent.
I do like that scene a lot. But I like even more at the end of the second movie when Hagrid is carrying Harry and everyone thinks he's dead, but he's actually alive.
I thought that part was a little bit cheesy, to be honest.
I think all of the movies have been a little bit cheesy, but they're true to the books for the most part which is what matters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you hear that there is a Harry Potter marathon this weekend?
No! When? What channel?
ABC network! I think it's called Freeform now, but it comes on friday through Saturday Starting with Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone.
Awesome! It's been so long since I watched them all back to back, but I'm not sure if I am ready to see Snape die agai.
Good point. He was such a deep character with so many angles. Remember when he smacked Harry and Ron on their heads during Potions Exams?
Yes, so funny! My favorite line of his was always "Turn to page 394".
That is an iconic quote. Much like Hermoine's "It's leviOsa, not leviosar".
Oh, Hermoine, she's another great character with a lot of depth and character. I'll never forget when she punched Draco!
I think that punch was what made Ron truly fall in love with Hermoine.
I think you're right. Man, it took him forever to finally realize that he loved her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite scene in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire?
I love the Yule Ball scene.
I like that one too, but it makes me mad when Ron ruins the whole thing for Hermione.
He was kind of a jerk to her in that movie. Neither him nor Harry thought she could get a date.
And then she ends up being asked by Viktor Krum, the most famous guy at the school!
I think Ron's just jealous because he secretly loves Hermione.
He really does love her, but they don't even kiss until the end of the Deathly Hallows Part 2.
I was kind of surprised that they ended up together.
Really? I think they make a good couple. Definitely better than Harry and Ginny.
Oh, I know. Ginny is the most boring character in the entire series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just realized something in Harry Potter.
What was that?
That Neville Long-bottom, could have been Harry, I mean could kill Voldemort just as easily.
How do you figure that?
Well, his parents were his enemies, Voldemort I mean.
So was most of the magical community.
Yes, but he was also saved out of love. Just like the prophecy said would be needed.
But his parents are alive.
They are not really, they are more or less comatose.  He was able to kill Voldemort just as easily as Harry.
Wow, I just realized you are right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So now that you have finished the entire series, what is your final Snape opinion?
Oh wow, I don't even know yet. I am still processing. I think I have always felt like Snape wasn't evil.
Even at the end of Half-Blood Prince?
Yes, I had a feeling more was going on. Good old Rowling!
Yeah, I had my doubts though. I still don't think he is all good. I mean, he still did really bad things.
I agree. And the reason he was good-ish at the end was because he was obsessed with a dead woman who didn't even love him!
Exactly! But man, I was crying with the whole Snape flashback.
Alan Rickman was absolutely amazing at that part. That was incredibly emotional.
He really was. And people say that's a kid's movie!
Right! It so isn't! Snape redeemed himself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, what did you think of the Lily/Sirius thing?
You mean the epic love story? I loved it.
It wasn't creepy to you?
No, why would it be?
He pined after this girl for years. Treated her son like crap, then dies.
Well, it was a little weird maybe.
The only reason he hated Harry is because he reminded him of James.
True, he hated James so much.
So, people love Snape and give him all sorts of credit, but I always found him creepy.
So did James!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
My favorite is the Goblet of Fire. I love all of the action in the different tasks of that movie.
I agree, there is a lot of fun in that one. My favorite is the Prisoner of Azkaban - I like meeting Sirius Black and hearing his true story.
Oh, that's a good one too! I love the relationship that develops between Harry and Sirius, but that mostly happens in later movies.
I also really like the relationship between Harry and Sirius. It's fun to see Harry have a father-figure, or more like a fun uncle, in his life. What do you think about the way Sirius dies?
Sirius' death is so weird to me. I can never figure out exactly what happens to him.
Yeah, that  was confusing to me, too. I don't like that it almost left the door open to him coming back, but he never did.
It was definitely one of the more unique deaths in the movies. Who is your favorite character in the movies?
I think my favorite character is Snape. His story is just so amazing. How about you?
I love Neville - his transformation from the first movie to the last is so huge, and I love how his character evolves throughout the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you get into watching the Harry Potter movies?
I just randomly saw a part of one of the original movies and I thought it was really cool.  I ended up renting the ones that were out at the time and I was hooked!
Me too!  At the time, I think it was just the first two that were already out on dvd.  Of course when the others came to theaters, I went and saw them on day one!
Me too!  I now have them all on blu-ray which makes them even better!
Me too!  I'm actually sad that they have ended!  I loved how it ended though!  Lord Voldemort got his behind handed to him!
Yes he did!  The Deathly Hallows part two was definitely my all time favorite movie of the series!
Mine too!  They ended those movies so good!  Have you read any of the books?
I have!  Believe it or not, the books are even better!
I've heard that!  They say that about a lot of your book made movies.  They always say the books are better.
They really are especially in the case of the Harry Potter books.  There is so much more going on in them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Harry Potter series?
It sucks.
Why do you say that?
JK Rowling is a hack
What? Stop not liking things I don't like!
Never. She's a terrible writer and nothing after the fourth book is good.
What books?
You know, those things you read?
I've never read the books,I only watch the movies when they air on ABC Family every other weekend.
Then I truly pity you. How sad must your life be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you read the books, right?
Yeah, why?
Did Harry break the Elder Wand in the books?
No, he just re-buried it with Dumbledore where anyone could get at it. One of the few film changes I actually liked, though they could've handled it better.
How so?
Well in the book, Harry repaired his wand first, remember when Hermione broke it in Hallows Part 1?
But what about the wand he was using during the final battle?
It was Draco's, and the movie implies he never gave it back.
Well there was a nineteen-year time skip, anything could've happened.
I guess, I just like the more definitive way the book spelled it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot believe they did a spot on job with the start of the movies though
The first one did have the best start
It did it felt pretty much perfect
Pretty much it nailed the atmosphere
Yeah it portrayed him desperate like he was in the book
It is also the most telling part
Pretty much because portrays him as a prisoner
Exactly
Yeah it would be interesting to have a movie about prior events
That would be a cool take
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish the movies did not cut out parts of harrys home life
They covered most of it
But so little time was spent on it as it was in some of them
Well they did not neglect it all though
They could have covered more
I think it was to keep it to a certain time
Still
Just be thankful for what they did get
I guess
It could have skipped more
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Potter charachter?
Sirius Black.
Really?
Yeah, he's played by my favorite actor.
Who's that.
Gary Oldman.
Never heard of him.
Commisioner Gordon from Dark Knight.
That's the same guy?!
That's why he's my favorite actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, I don't get the whole Ron and Hermione thing.
You don't like them as a couple?
I just don't think they're compatible.
Why not?
Because Hermione is an incredibly smart, academic type. Learning is her passion.
Yeah, but opposites attract, don't they?
Sometimes that's true, but I just don't see it in this case. Ron really isn't supportive of her interests unless they benefit him in some way.
Okay, I can see that.
I just would've rather seen her end up with someone else, you know? Someone a little more mature.
Now that you mention it, I did like Viktor Krum.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when Dumbledore died?
Of course how could I forget that.
I was just thinking about Harry mourning the loss.
Then everyone pointed there wands into the sky.
You read my mind it's like they did a eulogy.
Exactly.
Didn't the dark spot above them also go away when they did this?
I'm not sure but I believe so.
I wonder why that happened because there power in that moment was too strong?
Yeah i'm not sure that was confusing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite spell that they use in the Harry Potter movies?
I really like Lumos. I know that it's pretty practical, but I love how they can just have a quick light whenever they want. What about you?
Honestly, I like some of the Unforgivable Curses. I always thought Crucio was really interesting to use.
Really? The Unforgivable Curses have always scared me a little bit! Especially Avada Kedavra.
Yeah, I can see how they'd be scary. I think you really have to mean them to use them though.
That reminds me of how they always say the wizard doesn't choose the wand, but the wand chooses the wizard.
That makes me think of the scene in the Sorcerer's Stone when Harry is trying to find his first wand.
You're right. He goes through a few and none of them really agree with him, until one pops out of the shelf that seems to be drawn to him in a sense.
That's one of my favorite scenes in the entire series! I also like when they go to Gringotts for the first time.
Seeing how they have to get down to their vaults is crazy to me, but I love that goblins run the whole bank.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Did you watch the harry potter movies?
Yeah saw them all.
Did you have a least favorite?
I really didn't like the fifth one.
Yeah that one wasn't the best.
Agreed.
The characters weren't great.
Yeah I know what you mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the final Harry Potter flick.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part, 2!
Yes, with David Yates as director, once again.
Doesn't Harry "die" in this one?
Yes, he goes into limbo for awhile and sees Dumbledore.
Cool.  What happens in the end?
Harry finally kills Voldemort1
Yay!
Harry gets Ginny and Rupert gets Hermione.
Totally not right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why was Harry's family so mean/
What do you mean?
His brother and mom and dad, they're all mean.
No, that's not his real family.
It's not?
No.  His mom and dad died protecting him.
Oh.  I must have missed that.
That's a pretty huge miss.  It's like the center of the whole first movie.
I guess I better watch it again instead of get distracted.
I've got a copy if you'd like to watch it tonight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was prettier, Hermione or Ginny?
Early Hermione, or later Hermione?
Whichever
No, no no. You can't say whichever. There's a big difference
Fine, which do you prefer?
Later Hermione obviously.
Why?
One, she's older, more devoloped and two, she fixes her hair.
Fine. Who's prettier, Later Hermione or Ginny?
Hermione. Hands down and twice on Sunday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is one thing that bothered you about the Harry Potter movies?
Oh, you already know! Dobby!
Why Dobby, he's so sweet and cute.
No he's not! He's obnoxious, and nearly kills Harry at least two or three times.
Well I think he means well, but just ends up getting in the way, lol.
Well, he does help a bit in the end I guess.
A bit? He saves everyone by apparating into the Malfoy's cellar and saving the day.
True, I guess I overlooked that.
Dude, he DIED as a result. In Harry's arms no less.
You're right, okay, fine I love Dobby now! Now let's talk about Hedwig, the truly useless character!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Your birthday is coming up, what do you want?
I would love to have all the Harry Potter movies!
Are they any good?
You have never seen the Harry Potter series? For real?
No, I thought they were just kid books and movies.
Oh no, not at all! We need to watch them together.
How about I get the first one and we can watch it this week?
That would be great! I'm so excited to share with someone who is watching for the first time.
I'll give it a chance. So what is the name of the first movie anyway?
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all Harry Potter movies?
I did, and I didn't really like them?
Why not?
Well after the reading the books the movies left a lot to be desired.
I agree, I think the movies almost made it into a kid genre when it wasn't like that before.
What do you think could've changed that?
I think if they incorporated some more "adult" type themes it could've been better?
Adult themes like what?
Just more gore and maybe some swearing.
Yea, when I was a teenager I was cursing up a storm.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Just watched Harry Potter, there are some things that do not add up about the first one.
Like what?
Well, Harry's aunt and uncle were abusive. How did no one see this?
I do not think they let on to his living conditions to others.
Right, but what about when Harry went to his muggle school, how did the teachers not notice his clothes, his over all look of neglect.
Maybe it was magic?
No, this is before. The kid was pretty much a prisoner. Did people who came over to visit not see this?
Maybe the Dursleys were good at hiding?
They were awful ! I wish they would have gotten more of a punishment in the end.
They locked him up more than once.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That first Harry Potter movie was amazing.
Yes, I still remember it vividly.
I took my kids to see it and was blown away by it.
I loved the dining hall.
What about the sorting hat.
That was wicked cool!
I liked the characters from the start, especially Hagrid.
Oh yeah, and his little dog. (sarc)
Which one is your favorite?
I still say the first one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what did you think of the harry potter movies?
I thought they were pretty good.
I can hardly remember most of them past the first one.
I thought the books were better than the movies.
all I can remember is the one where he chases the snitch.
you don't remember him fighting the dragon?
that too. well that, and the second part of the final movie where snape dies.
yeah , that was pretty sad.
snape was on harry's team the whole time!
totally. he sacrificed everything to take down voldemort!
XXXXXXXXXXX
We should rewatch a Harry Potter movie.
Those were great.
It was the most successful move franchise ever.
I would have liked to be in that.
You would need to work on your accent.
Harry Potter was a cool dude in that.
He was pretty cool.
But at the end scene he seemed like nothing special.
Yeah, he broke the elder wand.
That was to prevent people from abusing it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, people are really hard on Snape for the way he treated Neville Longbottom.
Well, he was kind of a jerk.
Yeah, but have you ever thought about why?
Not really. I just figured he hated him because he wasn't good at magic.
I think it's a bit more complicated than that.
How so?
According to the prophecy, "the chosen one" was supposed to be born at the end of July. Neville was born around the same time as Harry.
So as far as Voldemort knew, it could've been either of them?
Yep, only he chose to go after Harry. If he'd chosen Neville instead, Lily would still be alive.
Oh! Well, I guess that explains it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched all of the Harry Potter movies yet?
Yeah, I have. I don't know how I feel about the Ginny-Harry love thing.
Really??  I love Ginny!  She's a kick-ass girl.
Yeah, but I mean, how many people marry their high school sweethearts?
Hello!  It's a movie!
Yeah, I know, but isn't it a little creepy to marry someone who was so crazy about you that she was lured to the chamber of secrets?
You do have a point there . . .
And her brother was a pseduo-brother for Ron.
I get your point.  Like they were kind of like family.
Yeah.  I mean, he didn't have to end up with anyone from Hogwarts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Last Sunday I have seen one of the Harry Potter movies.
Good. Which part of Harry Potter movies?
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 which was released on 2011.
I too like that movie. How did you feel?
Enjoyed very much. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter movies.
Harry, Hermione and Ron are grown up in this movie. And Hermoine looking too cute in this movie.
Exactly. I very much like these three characters.
After seven earlier films reaching back a decade, the Harry Potter saga comes to a solid and satisfying conclusion.
What I can observe is that this final film is a reunion of sorts for a great many characters we've come to know over the years.
Harry Potter is the ever green wonderful movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you believe you have a spirit animal like the patronus in Harry Potter?
I do, I believe mine is a black cat.
I think mine is a tiger, just based on what I feel and my affinity with them.
That was such a powerful moment when Harry called on his patronus to defeat the death eaters.
They were some scary characters huh? I heard J.K. Rowling thought them up while she was depressed.
Oh I believe that, it shows. The Prisoner of Azkaban was a really dark movie.
It was for sure one of the darkest. But I think it helped her defeat her own demons.
That was a great movie, I loved the way they turned back time and were able to see themselves in the past.
I love that part, really any movie with that subject or theme appeals to me.
Same here. Hermione was so clever during that whole segment.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter Book?
The Prisoner of Azkaban.
That's a good one.
Yeah, Sirius was misunderstood.
Some of the things they did at Hogwarts was crazy.
I think it was nice that he got to escape in the end.
It's sad that no one believed his innocence.
I'm not sure why they didn't expose Wormtail.
Maybe they were trying to act like they didn't know about Voldemort's rise.
The really didn't believe Dumbledore about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite movie in the Harry Potter series.
Mine is part 3, The Prisoner of Azkaban.
Oh I loved that one. My favorite though is The Goblet of Fire.
Oh really? I've seen them all and I've read the books.
Have you? Did you cry when Dumbledore did.
Yes I did, also when Dobby died. That was really sad.
Who's your favorite character in the movies?
I'd have to say Hermione. I love her cleverness and how well she fits in with the boys.
My favorite would have to be Hagrid. He's so sweet and funny.
Yeah I love how well he takes care of the magical beasts too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what I'm doing right now? Hint: it involves Harry Potter.
Let me guess, you're rewatching the entire series again? Which one are you on, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"?
You caught me! No, I'm on "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban".
That's my least favorit--they changed so much from the book. The Firebolt was given to Harry at the beginning, not the end.
You're right, but we get to meet Sirius.
You mean Padfoot. The Maruader's Map is revealed in "Prisoner of Azkaban" isn't it?
I think so! Fred and George Weasley give it to Harry Potter so that he can sneak around the castle and even into town.
That's right! And then he sees Peter Pettigrew, or Wormtail, on the map even though he's supposed to be dead.
What a twist! That jerk, Wormtail, I can't believe he is the one responsible for James and Lilly Potter's death.
I can! He's a wormy Wormtail. At least Harry got to finally have family in the end of that Book and Movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the last two harry potter movies were the worst
I think they were set up the best
No way
Why though
because they were to drawn out
But it covered most of the books
But it also was bloated
Thats the story though
I guess the story itself is bloated
Nah not at all
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Neville Longbottom?
I always felt really badly for him.
I didn't feel bad for him, I thought he was kind of stupid.
I don't think that's fair, he was never made to seem stupid.
Neville couldn't even use a broom the first time he tried!
Well, that's true. But he had a troubled childhood.
How did he have a troubled childhood?
Well, Neville's parents were kept in St. Mungo's and didn't even know who he was.
Really? I didn't know that.
Yeah, he was raised by his grandma, who always treated him like he was a Squib.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I love them all, but I think my favorite would have to be "Half-Blood Prince."
Oh yeah, I love that one too.  I especially like the romance between Ron and Lavender Brown.
Me too!  All the kids are growing up and really starting to notice the opposite sex in that one.
The relationship between Ron and Lavender is kind of the spark that gets Ron and Hermione together.
And then there's Harry and Ginny--they get together in this one too.
There really is a lot that goes on in "Half-Blood Prince."
Yep.  You find out about the horcruxes, you're introduced to Professor Slughorn . . .
Malfoy joins the death eaters and Dumbledore dies at the end . . .
Yes, it's really an emotional roller coaster.  There's humor, passion, terror, and finally grief all rolled into one great movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Merlin's beard, the Prisoner of Azkaban movie was awful.
Okay, I know you hate it, but can you name ANYTHING you like about it?
Um, okay, David Thewlis and Gary Oldman were amazing, and it was the only movie to get Harry's hair right.
That's it? What about the Marauder's Map?
I would've liked that more if they HADN'T MISSPELLED MOONY. THERE IS NO 'E', THE 'E' DOES NOT EXIST.
Okay, okay, calm down!
HOW CAN I CALM DOWN? HOW CAN THEY MISSPELL A NAME FROM SOMETHING THAT WAS BASED OFF A BOOK!
What made you more upset, the misspelling of Moony or the were-Chihuahua?
Oh, that's tough. I think it's still the misspelling.
I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who played Voldemort?
Ralph Fiennes.
That right!
He's such a great actor.
He plays a heck of a villian.
I can't think of a movie where he's played a good guy....
The English Patient?
That was a chick flick!
Still counts.
I suppose....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had me on the edge of my seat
And I was scare
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to watch one of the Harry Potter movies.
Great. Which one do you want to watch?
I am not sure, which one has lot's of action?
I would check out the first one.
Why is that?
The first one has action just like all the others.
Do I need to watch them all in order?
I would. It will give you all the backstories that help you understand it better.
Great. I will do that. Thanks for your help. You are like a wizard.
Thanks a lot for that compliment, muggle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you. I saw you just watched Half-Blood Prince.
Yes I did indeed. That certainly was an interesting one.
Yeah. I like it on it's own, but when compared to the whole series, it doesn't really make sense.
I agree. Though there definitely were some laugh out loud parts.
The entire Felix Felices part was hilarious. Harry was making me laugh so hard.
"By all means sir, come along!"
The part with Aragog dead and Harry says people are scared of it because of the pincers. His hand movements killed me!
Yeah. I am a pretty hard Hermione and Ron fan, so I did like the parts that put that at the forefront.
Some of that was pretty silly though. I mean, Hermione with those fake birds? What in the world was that?
Yeah that made me laugh too because it was so ridiculous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think we will ever get any more Harry Potter movies?
I don't think Rowling wants to write any more.
She said that and then she wrote the screenplay and that movie about fantastic beasts.
True, but those weren't in the same line, really.
I could see them going ahead and doing more about the fallout of Voldemort's reign.
Someone evil has to take his place.
So then Harry's kids take up the fight?
Yes, or maybe his grandchildren.
It would be kind of a rip-off, though.
They do it with all franchises eventually.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where did all the food come from at the banquets?
I think it was just magic.
No, wait, I remember.  House elves cook it?
No they don't.  I remember Dumbledore just waving his wand and it appearing.
No, no, see, the elves made it, Dumbledore just made it visible.
That doesn't make any sense.  The elves could just bring it up.
But maybe it was easier to just use magic to bring it up vs. the elves doing it physically.
They're house elves, they're used to hard work.
One thing's for sure, I would eat a ton at one of those.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite part about the first Harry Potter movie is when he is learning about magic!
Yes, me too. Especially when he learns about Diagon Alley!
Picking a wand and a pet must be soooo exciting !
I would go straight to Ollivanders !
I would be a little scared to see what wand chooses me.
I wouldn't, I'd be so anxious and ready.
Do you think you'd get a pet ?
I think so, probably an owl and you?
I don't think I would. Maybe a cat.
The owls are beautiful though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a weird theory about Neville and Snape, I'm not sure if it makes sense though.
Try me out and I'll tell you if it does.
Okay, so you know how Snape was always even more terrible than normal when it came to Neville?
Yes, he treated him the worst, well up there with Harry at least.
So, my theory is that he treats him so bad because of the prophecy.
The Voldemort/Harry prophecy?
Well, remember, it became Harry's prophecy BECAUSE Voldemort chose him.
Right, he could have chosen Neville, but didn't.
So, if he chose Neville instead of Harry, then Lily would still be alive presumably.
Oh, wow, okay so he hates Neville for being alive, as he sees the prophecy and Voldemort's choice when he sees Neville. Wow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need a good movie for myself and kids included
Have you watched "Harry Potter"?
Oh ya, I have but my kids havent, thats a great suggestion
Its great for kids to be able to use their imagination
I should get the books for them before we watch
Thats a great idea, who is your favorite character?
I know most everyone says Harry, but I love Ron Weasley
I can see that, he is very funny in the movies
Lord Voldemort is creepy, but also one of my favorites
Oh I can agree 100 percent
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I like the first one.
Yeah, that one was very cool.
I like the story and how he figures out who he is.
What did you think of the other movies?
They were good, but not as good as part 1.
Did you like how it all ended?
Yeah, it was cool. I wish they kept making more though.
Yeah, me too. They are all good movies.
I think it is one of the best movies to be made from a book.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the last two Harry Potter movies.
Oh my gosh! What did you think!?
I was really pleased with it. I'm glad they split it into two parts to cover more, since the book was so long.
Yeah, it's nice now that we can watch them together, but it was awful when part one had come out and part two hadn't yet!
Did you see them in theaters?
I saw part one on opening night, but I saw part two in theaters a few weeks after it came out.
What was it like when Dobby died at the end of part one?
The whole theater was crying! He was such a loved character, and opening night was full of die hard fans.
Man, I wished I hadn't missed that!
It was something!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you read the Cursed Child screenplay yet?
Yeah, it wasn't quite what I expected.
What do you mean?
I expected it to be more like the novels. Harry didn't interact as much with his kids as I expected either.
Well, the focus was supposed to be on his youngest son.
Sure, but there just wasn't enough interaction between the two different generations.
It had to be concise, though. It's a screenplay, not a novel.
I guess you're right. I just wish there were more.
There could be at some point. They could make it into a movie and then a novel.
That would be awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I really like The Deathly Hallows 1.
It was pretty good with all of the different scenes when they were on the run. My favorite is The Goblet of Fire.
Oh yeah, that one is pretty good, too. Why is it your favorite?
I like it because we get to see them as teenagers for the first time exploring their first love sort of thing. And I like the ballroom scene.
Hermiony did look really pretty in her dress. It seems like she went for kind of a bad boy.
She didn't seem to have much in common with him. He was all brawn and no brain. But looks count for something when you are exploring. Plus I think she was trying to get Ron to make a move by making him jealous.
Ron did seem a little jealous about the two of them. He didn't really have a good time at the dance.
No, he didn't. But that was his own fault. He wouldn't dance so his date found someone else.
Ha, Ha. Yes she did. I had forgotten about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you read the harry potter books?
I havent, but i've seen all the movies.
You should definitely read the books as well, highly recommend it.
What do you think the differences are between the books and movies?
I think that there are a lot of differences, they left a lot of details out of the movies that was in the books.
What book would you recommend I read first?
You should just read them in order!
I think i'll read them and then watch the movies as I finish the book.
That's a fantastic idea, you'll be able to see all the little differences i'm talking about.
exactly. Thanks for the suggestion!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So which was your least favorite harry potter?
I would say the first one.  I mean it was still good, but a little childish.
Yeah I know what you mean.  I like the later ones where people start to die, and they start dealing with crushes.
I did like however how they made it to grow up with the child.  As the movies go on they deal with more adult issues.
Like jealousy between Rob and Harry over Harmine, even though her and Harry never have anything going on.
Or the death of friends, showing that not everyone gets out alive when it comes to all out wizard wars.
The best one I thought though was the Goblet of Fire.
Yes, I like when Voldemort came back.  The guy is ten kinds of creepy.
Especially with that snake of his.
I know, the snake is pretty tough in it's own right tough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire!
What did you think of it? That's one of my favorite movies in the whole series!
I liked it a lot. But it got pretty dark, especially towards the end when Harry comes out with Cedric's body.
It does get dark. It has some funny parts though too!
Which parts are you thinking of?
When Fred and George try to put their names in the cup and get cursed with beards, and then when Dumbledore corners Harry after his name gets pulled.
That is funny. He storms at Harry and yells "DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME INTO THE GOBLET OF FIRE!" even though in the book it says he calmly asks him.
It's so crazy too how the real Professor Moony was hidden at the bottom of a huge trunk the entire time.
That is really crazy. If you could take Polyjuice Potion to turn into any character, who would it be?
Probably Professor McGonnagall. She's whip smart and is one of my favorite characters in the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which was your favorite Potter film.
I liked the first one best.
Me too. Harry started getting a little long in the tooth at the end.
Too true!
Old man Potter!
Ha! They were all pretty good though.
I thought so too.
We should watch them again.
This weekend?
You're on!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had me on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you finished the Harry Potter series yet?
I haven't yet.
Which one are you on?
I believe I'm at The Goblet of Fire.
That's where it starts getting really good in my opinion. You're going to love it.
I do love it so far. I wish I'd gotten into it earlier.
Better late than never!
I love all the magic. I also love that they've created their own sport.
You mean Quidditch?
Yes, I thought that was so creative and amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen Harry Potter right?
Yes I have why do you ask?
You know what my favorite part was?
What's that?
It was on the train when Harry Hermoine and Ron all meet.
Why is that the part you like the most.
It's meaningful and it's the start of a great friendship and many adventures to come plus it introduces us to the main characters nicely.
It was a pretty impactful seen that was well done.
Just something about the simplicity of it and looking back on it makes it shine like a diamond.
Now that you mention it that is one of the better happy moments.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched any Harry Potter movies?
I watched all of the 8 movies in the theater indeed.
That's a big surprise. Which one do you like most?
I like the one titled "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", although I know many people do not like it very much.
I do not like it either. I think the storyline is somehow not good for children.
Too scary? Not really indeed. It has time travel part which is fantastic.
But the scenes of Dementors in the movie are really scary.
I see. What is your favourite Harry Potter movie?
The first one, the Sorcerer's Stone.
I like the first one too. It introduces a new magic world to the audience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the saddest part of the series is?
It's a toss up between the death of Dumbledore or Fred's death.
The whole Dumbledore death and lead up was phenomenally done.
Agreed, from the cave scene on I had a feeling but I didn't think it would happen.
Then Dumbledore begging for death when Harry forced the potion down his throat. Heartbreaking.
Oh that part killed me. Then when they get back and get to the tower.
Oh no! I always hated Malfoy, but in that moment I'm not sure if I hated him or pitied him.
Clearly he's despicable, but I felt for him a little too.
Then, with his final act of power, Dumbledore keeps Harry bound under the cloak.
And Harry only realizing he was free because Dumbledore had died. Oh, I hated it so much but it was so well done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Harry Potter movies?
Definitely!  They were so well done.
I know, I loved the soundtrack.  I read the books and couldn't wait for the movies.
Yeah, they definitely did the books justice.  I can't believe what a good job Daniel Radcliffe did when the movies first started.
I know, he was so young and yet did such an incredible job acting.
It was interesting to sort of watch them grow up on screen too.
Definitely.  What was your favorite movie in the series?
Honestly, I really enjoyed the Goblet of Fire the most.  I thought the storyline with the game was really intriguing.
Yeah, that was definitely one of the best.
For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like when they go to Hogsmeade
Its so cool that they get to take field trips when they are at hogwarts.
I agree
I feel bad when Harry doesnt have a permission slip so he cant go
Me too
But im glad he finally got to go.
Same here, they shouldnt punish him because his parents died
Exactly
I really like these movies
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why can't I find a badly scribbled over textbook that contains all the answers I need for school like in Harry Potter.
Exactly! I think we'd end up squabbling quickly over it just like Harry and Ron do in Half-Blood Prince.
Nah, we'd end up sharing it. What I love is how much Hermione fumes over the scribbles being more spot on compared to the instructions in the book.
Oh, totally, Emma Watson did that so well. I think most people that love Hermione's character had to love how that played out in the movie.
True, I burst out laughing when the students are working on their potions and Hermione's hair has gone from curly to crazy thanks to the fumes.
That was perfect! Also, her scene in Potions where she lets it slip what she smells when she smells the love potion Amortentia.
Yes! Awkward teen moment there; some of it is just loving Hermione's character throughout the movies but some of it is that I think Slughorn's Potions class would have actually been fun.
Dangerous but fun, it seemed like everything was free to explode or catch fire. The movie is pretty intense for the series so it was like a bit of relief from all the tension.
Yep, until Harry gets his assignment from Dumbledore to ask about the Horcruxes. Not to mention Ron accidentally overdosing on a badly mixed love potion which was fairly funny and then turning around and getting accidentally poisoned.
I know, poor Ron! He's definitely put through the ringer in Half-Blood Prince with the poisoning, Quidditch, and all the drama between him and Hermione.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I rewatched Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone last night.
Is that your favorite movie from the series?
It does tend to be the one that I end up rewatching more often than not. I think it's my favorite simply because of nostalgia - plus, it reminds me how much I love Neville Longbottom.
Oh yeah, he's one of my favorite characters too! I love Luna Lovegood too.
Which is your favorite movie?
It has to be tied between Sorcerer's Stone and Order of the Phoenix.
What's your favorite part about Order of the Phoenix? I really like that you get to see Harry with Sirius more, as sad as it ends up being by the end.
I like that there's a little bit more action and things start to get more intense. And Tonks, I wish we got to see more of her.
Yeah, I could enjoy a whole movie of just Tonks' story. I did like her more in the books but I think the actress was a good pick.
Same here, her backstory has to be so interesting. And I love that scene where she's making Ginny and Hermione laugh by changing her face.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who was your favorite character in the harry potter films?
Hagrid, he was always so loveable.
I did enjoy him as well. The gentle giant as they say.
He always was true to Harry and he had cool animals.  what about you?
It may be bland but I always liked Harry Potter best. Than maybe gobbe.
Harry mayb be obvious but a great character. I like ron but wish Harry ended up with herimone instead.
Ya I felt the romance between Ron and Hermione was off and awkward to watch on screen.
Agreed. I know J.K. wanted to do something not so typical but this felt forced, not authentic.
Maybe in the books it was a clearer attraction or better presented. But I never read the books only watched the films.
Same for me. i have heard the books are really great. i felt a little old to start them at the time and then after you see the movies hard to read the book version.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never understood why Goblet of Fire was liked so much.
Why didn't you like it?
Just felt that the actual games took way too long.
That was the best part of the movie.
Well, we already knew Harry would win, so why take so long?
Did you not enjoy seeing the dragons?
Yeah, that was cool.
Or the way he handled the water task?
Yeah, that was cool too.
So that settles it.  You should like it because those scenes were cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello.
Do you like the harry potter movies?
Yeah sure.
Cool.
What about you?
Yeah I enjoy them.
Do you have a favorite?
I liked the third one a lot.
That one was very good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the last Harry Potter movie ended well?
You mean with seeing the future of how things all turned out?
Yeah, I'm not sure that was a good idea. I almost would have liked the movie to end before the future scene with characters all grown up.
Yeah, those actors looked like they were playing dress up in grown up clothes.
It was weird for me. I could have done without that. And the creepy Voldemort baby. Yuck.
Yeah, I'm not sure what that was about. I really liked the story and wanted to see what JK Rowling's vision was for her characters, but...
I know. It just seemed like she was over it and then decided to go all Disney.
Well, if you're going to go all magical kingdom...
Yep Disney is where all the magic happens
But I wonder what could have been done if someone like Spielburg had done those movies...it's thought...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Harry Potter film?
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .
Really the first one? But it was the most childish of all the series.
Well it is geared toward kids, all of them. This may be much less dark than say the final one. But I enjoyed it the most.
It was neat to get to see the actors grow up from this film onward.
I think so. Kids that were there age could really identify probably feed into the popularity more.
Daniel radcliffe is such a baby in the first one. In terms of looks that is. Harry the character has always been somewhat brave.
I think Hermione Granger was always bravest.
She was certainly well read and headstrong.
Emma watson was really perfect in that role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had me on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Potter charachter?
I'd have to say the Weasley twins.
They were pretty funny.
Too bad they weren't in it more.
True. All the Weasleys were pretty good though.
I like the father a lot.
The mom was kind of annoying.
I thought so too.
Still, I liked Hermione best.
That was a good character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw all the Harry Potter movies, but I haven't read the book.
Really? You definitely need to read the books.
I don't know, sometimes I'm disappointed with books versus movies. I might just stick with the movies.
The books are so good, you have to read them.
The books won't ruin the movies for me, and the movies won't ruin the books?
No, not at all. I mean you will know most of what happens, but you will still like it.
But don't I know it all, already? Reading the books after the movies seems like overkill.
The books have a lot of scenes that are not in the movies. And you will find out a lot more about some of the characters.
Well, maybe I will read the books, then.
You totally should. the movies are still great, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why does Ron's whole family have red hair.
Uh... because his parents do?
I guess is what I'm saying is you would think at least one of them wouldn't.
Well, the whole point is that the Weasleys are known as the red-headed family.
I guess that's why they're recognized everywhere.
Absolutely.
You think they ever thought of dying it?
Why would they do that?  Just to blend in more?
Exactly.
Nah, their hair makes them who they are.  They like the attention.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the most over rated wizard in the Harry Potter movies is?
That's easy, all the Malfoys.
Yeah, especially Luscious.  I mean everyone was terrified of this guy and he hardly did anything except spew threats.
I like the Mr. Weasly stood up to him and he seemed to back down.  Gives me the impression that maybe Malfoy was all talk.
Voldy seemed to have esteem for him at one point.  But he turned out to be a punk.
Yeah, you can see at the end he looks like hell.
Might have been interesting to see him fight.  Although it seems his wife might be stronger than him, at least mentally.
Any Draco, although he was like his dad.  All talk and no fight.
Always claiming how tough he was and never really fought anyone.
I wish Harmine would have turned him into a toad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just started watching the Harry Potter movies this weekend.
You just started watching them!? Why haven't you seen them before now?
Well, I really like the books, but I was worried that the movies would ruin them for me.
Oh, I understand. How far have you gotten?
I watched the first two last weekend.
And what do you think so far?
They're really similar to the books so far, I really like them. I think Daniel Radcliff is the perfect Harry.
The first three movies or so are really similar to the books, but they start to change things up a little in the fifth one and on.
Well, I'm looking forward to watching the rest.
Let me know what you think!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the flying car scene in Harry Potter I believe it was in Chamber of Secrets.
No what flying car scene?
You know the one where Ron returns and Harry is saved?
Barely can you give a bit more detail?
The car was a Ford Anglia and Harry was trying to escape the Hursleys, ringing a bell?
Oh yeah I remember now.
I just finished watching that scene and had to pause the movie.
Why?
So I could ask you about it and tell you it was awesome.
Okay now i'm getting nostalgic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I did not like the actor who played ron
Why did you not like ron
He was just to whiney and felt out of place
I thought he matched the persona of the books
Not at all he was so off base
I just feel the opposite
But how though
He just felt and looked the part hard to describe it
I mean he did look it
Exactly though and thats half the battle
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like harry potter
Yes love those movies
Me too.
My favorite character is hagrid
Me too
I love how he just comes bursting into the dursleys
And completely scares them
It was funny.
He such a good chance character
And a great friend
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched the last two Harry Potter movies this past weekend.
What did you think?
They were pretty good. I wish I had seen them when they came out in theaters.
Yeah, it is more exciting to see the action taking place on the big screen.
There were many scenes that had me holding my breath.
Oh, right. I forgot you did not read the books. Which scenes are you talking about?
For example, the scene where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were running away from the Death Eaters in the woods.
Oh yeah, and how about the scene when they visited Godric's Hollow and the old lady turned out to be the snake? That was scary.
But I thought the battle scene could have been more epic.
Really? I thought it was well done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
Number six in the series?
Yes, directed by David Yates.
Who plays Draco?
Tom Felton.
Does Harry fall for someone?
Ginny Weasley, the twins' young sister.
Anything big happen?
Dumbledore dies!
Oh no!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
Oh, yeah. How did you like it?
I thought it was great. Especially when Twilight died.
Ha. That was pretty good. However, there was so much missing from the movie that was in the book.
I know. It was the first movie that really broke away from the book.
Of all of the movies, I think that Goblet of Fire was the one that should have been split in two.
Really? I think Order of the Phoenix  is the one that should have been split up into two movies.
I disagree. What would they have done, had them at the house for most of the first movie.
That's true. I guess it would have been rather boring to watch since move of the movie was just "mundane" stuff happening.
Yes. Then again, it would have given Creature more film time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think I have watched all the Harry Potter films at least ten times each.
What is your favorite one.
I like all of them but I have to say Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone is my favorite.
Why do you like that one so much?
Harry is so young and naive in it, yet he still knows what he wants in life.
Do you like the way he shows up Malfoy, when he tries to get Harry to join the Slytherin House?
Yes, and I love when the Sorting Hat is not sure what house to put Harry into.
In the later episodes, Dumbledore does tell Harry that it could have gone either way?
I know. I think it shows that if Harry had wanted to be evil instead of good, it was that moment that the choice was made
One seemingly small choice at the time. It kind of was what started Harry on the path he took.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I'm a bit confused about Harry's parents.
What part is confusing?
His dad was a total jerk and his mom was nice.
Yeah.  So?
I thought it his parents would have been more pure.  Seem like that's kind of how Harry was supposed to.
No way.  Harry was supposed to be conflicted.
Just seems weird to me that Harry shouted all the time.
That was his dad's rebellious side.
Maybe Harry is just a jerk.
You try being the boy who lived!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who were your favorite casting choices in the Harry Potter movies?
Well, Daniel Radcliffe was perfect for Harry. I also think Emma Watson nailed Hermione's character.
How about Alan Rickman?
Yeah, he played a wonderful Snape. Not quite how I pictured him from the books, but he played the part so well that it didn't matter.
Luna was good, too.
Oh, for sure! I don't remember the actress's name, but she did really well as a character that was both dreamy and fiercely intelligent.
Don't forget about Professor McGonagall.
Of course! Maggie Smith was perfect!
I also thought the Malfoys were portrayed really well.
I totally agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Harry Potter?
Like the wizard movies? Yeah why?
Finally got around to seeing one of them the other day. Don't get what the fuss was about.
I mean they're pretty good kids movies I guess?
It just didn't make sense ya know? Like why do I care about this wizard guy getting killed?
Wait, what movie did you watch?
Harry Potter! you know where Snake kills Dumblebore.
That's the sixth movie.
Oh. Well.... never mind then
Whatever man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished watching Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix!
Oh wow! Isn't it great? What did you think?
I think it's interesting how much darker all of the movies keep getting as they progress through the series.
Same. I get so sad whenever I watch that movie and Sirius dies.
I know. It's so sad to see Harry losing the only real family member he's ever known.
That's true. The only good thing is that he has so many people who care about him that he'll always have a surrogate family in a sense.
I just have a feeling that the rest of the movie are going to get so dark that he'll probably keep losing people he loves.
Yeah, I'm not sure. What was your favorite part of the whole movie?
I liked the scene when they're in the Ministry of Magic and they're trying to save the Prophecy.
I also like when Professor Trelawney gives them divination readings. Everyone thinks she's crazy, but she actually knows what she's talking about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I just saw the whole Harry Potter series, again, for the second time.
What did you think the second time round?
There was a lot of deep stuff I missed the first time.
Like what?
Well, for one that Luna can see the ghost horses only those whom have seen death can.
Yep, shows she has seen some awful things.
Then it went on to show her life at home, her dad seemed off.
I think that is what made her complex. She was more than just a kid, she had seen a lot of death and sadness.
But she still kept the sort of sad but happy tone to herself.
I think it was meant to show that even young people can grown from despair, it changes them, but they can still be happy in their selves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1.
I didn't like them making two movies out of one book.
Yes, it's all about the money.
Any good scenes?
I like when they made six decoy Potters.
Cool.  What was the group Harry is up against?
The Horcruxes.
Right. Anybody get killed in this one?
Dobby.
Oh, no!
XXXXXXXXXXX
We bought the kids Harry Potter for Christmas. The entire DVD collection was only 50.00 on Amazon!
Are you serious? Did they watch them yet?
We have only watched a few so far. They keep wanting to rewatch the first one.
That's awesome! I love that one!
Me too! WHich one is your favorite.
It's so difficult to choose! I'd have to go with number 4 "Goblet of Fire".
Good choice: poor Cedric Diggory!
When his dad runs in crying and screaming "my boy" I cry every single time.
I always cry whe Dobby dies. Stupid Bellatrix.
Yes, I agree! However, she does makes a great villain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think Draco got a fair shake in the story?
You know, he was a spoiled brat but if you had to go to school with Harry Potter, it might be annoying.
Actually, I think Harry and I would have been friends.
Really? I don't know what house I would have been put in but those actors did not look like what I imagined compared to the books.
No? Snape was casted well and so was the first Dumbledore. Harry was okay...but Ron was supposed to have a long skinny nose.
Yeah, Hermione....don't get me started. Her hair was fake frizzy and it took me while to get used to her. Not what I imagined.
Me neither. I'm not sure Voldemort looked right either.
Yeah, it's not anything like what I imagined though I'm not sure what that was...given the description in the books.
Maybe more like the James Earl Jones in Conan the Barbarian?!?
Oh yeah, that would have been cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans?
Ewww, I can't believe I know this...but booger flavor.
My favorite was when they tranfigured the opjects in Water goblets
Not, me I love when they made the love potion.
I loved when Hermione take a hair from for the Polyjuice Potion...do you remember from who?
Of course! Millicent Bulstrode.....I love that part!
Who's favorite color is Lilac.....?
Easy! Gilderoy Lockhart.....do you have any actual hard ones?
Ok, fine- Heres a super hard one What time do Harry and Hermione travel back in time?
7:30 - easy
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I had a Harry Potter marathon the other day.
Really? How many did you watch?
I watched all eight, it took all day.
That is crazy, which one is your favorite?
I like the last one, the battle at Hogwarts is just so epic!
I like that one too, so much better than the Deathly Hallows Part 1.
Yes! That one was so boring, all they did was talk and camp.
I almost fell asleep the first time I watched it.
Well, they made up for it with part 2.
Yes, it was such a great movie to end the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite movie series?
Harry potter
Those are really good
Yes they are, i enjoyed all of them
Me too
I liked the sport the played
Quidditch
Yea that one
Its pretty cool how they made up a whole flying game
Yea it is
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love harry potter
Me too, they are great movies
My favorite is the sorcerers stone
That was good, my favorite is prisoner of azkabam
I like sirius
Me too, he's a good character
He is, i was happy to see him come into the series
He was helpful to harry
And i was happy to see that harry had more family
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Harry Potter the character in the movies?
Yes I think he is a very interesting character.
I like him because he's been through so much and so have I plus he never gives up on a task or a person.
No he doesn't he always persevere's to the end no matter the obstacles.
Wasn't his parents killed when he was a baby?
Yes they were protecting him from Voldemort.
That's right, not sure how I forgot about that.
I'm not sure either it's a big part of the story.
I love how he manages to always or most of the time come out of top no matter the circumstances.
Yep he's pretty clutch you could say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are they making a movie based on the new book
I think they are
I keep up with nothing so i had no idea
Have you not heard the controversy
What controversy
The one of them recasting hermoine
Why is it controversial
Because people prolly want the old actor
But is she not to old to keep going
That is true
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old were you when you first saw harry potter
Saw?
Yeah the movies
Oh i have never actually watched the movies
Why not
I prefer the books
But the movies bring them to life though
But they cannot match the books
I beg t differ
Well we shall differ then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the Harry Potter movies is your favorite?
That's a hard decision. For the earlier movies, I like "Prisoner of Azkaban" best.
Me too. How about the later ones?
Well, I like the second installment of "Deathly Hallows" best. It was great to see Voldemort destroyed.
I like that one, but I was sad to lose so many of my favorite characters.
I can understand that. Which of the later movies is your favorite then?
Definitely "Half-Blood Prince". That's where everything started coming together, and Snape was excellent.
You do love Snape, don't you?
Yes, he's definitely my favorite character.
Obviously.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all off the Harry Potter movies?
Hell yeah, they are some of my favorite all time movies.
Mine too, I loved the whole series.  The way they brought it to live was amazing.
I know, they did a great job of making you feel like it was real.
The Deathly Hallows part two was a great ending to the series.
I agree, they did a great job of bringing the book to life.
I wish they would make more.  Know that Harry is older and a father, I would love to see a new movie.
Me to, He could be a teacher or the Headmaster now.
I hate that Dumbledore died.  I loved him.
Yes, the character and the actor were awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wanna talk about movies?
Sounds great
Alright what about harry potter?
I love those movies
Me too, they have a great storyline
I agree, they are very addictive to watch
I love neville longbottom
I feel so bad for him
Me too
Hes so sweet
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hogwarts must be a huge place.
Of course it's huge.  Look at how big the place is.
What I mean is that to house that many students, it must have a ton of beds.
Each house has it's own section not too mention all the hidden parts of the castle.
Yeah,would have been cool to explore that place.
Probably really easy to get lost.
Well, you'd definitely need a map of some kind.  I would just sit in the hall the whole time.
And probably eat all the food, right?
Yeah, those banquets looked awesome.
Best buffet ever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish the movies were more faithful
What does faithful mean
It means they are not that faitful
How so
Well they leave many of the small details out of the books out
Well you know they do that to be concise
What does concise mean
I mean it is be natural and not drawn out
But we wanted a faithful adaption
I think it is
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best spell in Harry Potter?
Hmmm, Accio....the summoning charm. You could get stuff without having to get off your bed!
Accio, milk and cookies! Yeah that would be cool. How about stupefy? Stunning spells would be awesome.
Yeah, like when you hear annoying people complaining. I could use that. How about petrificus totalus! Now you're statue.
Sweet! I could use that one. What about the bat boogey hex?
I got someone in mind for that one!
Yeah, me too. I could have used that the other day. How about ascendio? You could fly over a stadium or concert and watch from there!
Yeah that would be cool. I could get in to that!
Confundo! Confuse and disorient to get out of jobs. That would be excellent.
Yeah too bad my wand is in the shop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe we'll never have a new Harry Potter film.
I know. I get so depressed thinking about it.
I grew up with Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
I know what you mean. I was always the same age as the actors, so I literally felt like I grew up with them.
Same here. I miss seeing Snape and Dumbledore too.
It's hard to believe Alan Rickman passed away. He was the perfect Snape.
I try not to think about it. Which was your favorite film in the series?
I always loved Goblet of Fire.
Me too! But I think my favorite is Order of the Phoenix.
I agree. Those two were seriously the best out of all of them.

I just saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
I did not see that.  Who's the director?
David Yates.
Is that the one where Dumbledore is upstaged as principal?
Yes, by Dolores Umbridge.
Who plays Umbridge?
Imelda Staunton.
What happens in the end?
Dumbledore gets reinstated and Umbridge is thrown from power.
Hooray for Dumbledore!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seems weird, the whole concept of Horcruxes.
Well, it's definitely different.
I think Voldemort was kind of dumb though.
How so?
Why hide your soul in well-known objects?  Do it in a tin can or something.
If I remember right, it was because he wanted to prove a point.
What point is that?
That he respected the wizarding world and wanted the objects to have meeting.
Well, if it were me, I would have done it in rocks or something.
That's why you're not a wizard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, I just reread the entire series, let's talk about our least favorite characters!
I absolutely hate Bellatrix.
Well, she's a horrible woman, but not a bad character. I mean characters that don't have much of a purpose.
Well, then it would definitely be Lupin.
Shut your mouth, wow. Lupin is a saint.
Well, I hate the force Tonks and Lupin storyline, and I think Lupin is just kind of weak.
He taught Harry how to do a patronus. And was a good teacher and friend.
No, he literally just did nothing and stayed in the background most of the time. Who's your least favorite?
Wow, you're delusional! My least favorite character would have to be Molly Weasley.
Okay, we can't be friends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what my favorite potter scene was?
No. What?
When Ron tried to cast that spell on Malfoy...
Oh, yeah! "Eat slugs!"
That killed me when it backfired!
And Hagrid's "Specialist equipment."
A bucket!
I laughed so hard!
That was a pretty good bit.
I'll have to rewatch that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite part of Harry Potter
I like platform nine and three quarters
Yea that was neat
It was so cool how they have to run through the wall to get to the Hogwarts express
Harry was so scared when he did it the first time
It was kind of funny
I like the owls
It seems cool to have a pet owl and they also deliver letters
That would be amazing
Totally
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really loved the Harry Potter movies, but I wish we could've learned more about some of the characters. They're fascinating.
Like who?
Lily, for one. We know she was Snape's friend, James's wife, and Harry's mother, but we never get to know her as an individual.
Well, she was obviously kind and willing to do anything for the people she loved.
I know, but it feels like we learned a lot more about James than we did about her.
Yeah, I guess she was a pretty important character, wasn't she?
Her sacrifice basically saved the Wizarding world, so yeah.
She does deserve a lot of credit for that.
I agree. I've always seen her and Snape as the two biggest saviors, perhaps even more than Harry himself.
I can see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do I have to start at the beginning of the Harry Potter series?
Yes! They could do okay stand alone but you won't get nearly as much out of it!
So when it starts he is eleven and grows up in the series?
Yes, and basically grows up during it. The whole thing is about him and his friends and how they grow as characters.
Will I be missing out by not reading it first?
I always love the books more and there is definetly some things you will miss by not reading first.
But just watching the movies is okay to?
Oh for sure! The movies might even inspire you to read it!
Okay, cool. I just bought the first dvd so I will watch tonight.
Oh good! I can come over if you want and we can discuss it after.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last Harry Potter movie you saw?
I saw one of the Deathly Hallows.
It was cool to see them out of school.
The three friends stayed together.
Yeah, they got into fights, but always ended it well.
I thought Ron was going to leave the Horcrux hunt for good.
Do you think Harry and Hermione should have gotten together?
I think it would have been cool for Harry to have had a totally different girlfriend.
Yeah, it seems like there aren't that many people if you want to choose a wizard.
Harry Potter was famous, I'm sure he didn't have problems with the ladies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I would love to play some Quidditch.
Seems kind of dangerous....
That's half the fun!
Maybe if I had a Nimbus 2000!
Only the best. Which position would you play?
Seeker.
You think alot of yourself!
I think I could do it.
Sure, why not.
If you're gonna dream, dream big!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder why they chose to alter some scenes in the movies
Well for the movies to flow better it had to be done
But why though it saddens me to have changes
Well they skip some parts
Oh i knew some was altered but not skipped
Well obvisouly they do
Why though
Because they need to make it fit together good
I guess that makes perfect sense
Yeah you want it to be good and concise
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite part of the Goblet of Fire?
I really like when Harry has to go underwater to save Ron.
I liked that part too. I thought it was very brave when he tried to save both Hermione and Ron.
So did I. But it was scary to me when the mermaid yelled at him that he could only take one person!
I like that movie a lot because of how Harry and Cedric help each other through the challenges.
It was nice of Cedric to tell Harry to take his golden egg underwater, and before that Harry told him that the first challenge involved dragons.
It just made it that much sadder when Cedric died.
Oh I know! And when Harry came back and everyone was cheering until they realized he had Cedric's body with him.
Do you think everybody thought he killed Cedric?
I think some people still do think he killed Cedric. Nobody wants to believe that Voldemort is back again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am missing out
Can you tell me what you are missing
I realize i have missed a few of the movies
What ones
I never watched both parts of the deathly hollows
Well why do we not fix this then
Do you own them
I think i do
Well find them please
Sure and we can watch them
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix?
I liked it.  It was a turn for the more mature part of the story line.
Yeah I agree, it was really cool to see how strong Harry really is too.
I know what you mean.  And to see him as a leader.
He never really thought of himself as a leader, but clearly he is, and he was a good teacher.
I know.  Tough as nails too, he doesn't seem it behind those round glasses, but he's top shelf.
I just hated that lady in pink.  Looking like she was some innocent person but really she was evil.
I know what you mean.  I love how the students were so powerful by the end she couldn't control them.
Yes, it was a good point that force alone cannot take on the wizard world.
Foreshadowing no doubt for the final movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite actor in the Harry Potter movies?
I love Emma Watson.
Yeah, she seems like such a cool person.
And she places Hermoine so perfectly, even if it's different from the books.
I have to say I love Ralph Fiennes.
He's so good as Voldemort. And a lot of people didn't realize it was him!
Yeah, the CGI or whatever they used to change his face was really well done.
Same for the goblins.
What do you mean?
Griphook was played by Warwick Davis, so they definitely had to use something to change how his nose and ears looked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite part of the Harry Potter series?
Oh that's easy to put it simply "your a wizard Harry".
That was an awesome moment by why is it your favorite?
That's when he finds out he's a wizard.
Yeah, so what?
That's the beginning of it all, this whole magically epic franchise well the movies at least.
Yeah i'm not sure it's my favorite though out of everything in the movies.
It sets the stage and how many times have you heard that saying.
Way too many.
Plus Hagrid says it and he's one of my favorite charcters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think the students started wearing more Muggle-like clothing in the Prisoner of Azkaban?
I know it was a deliberate choice of the new director, and I think they wanted to make the characters more relatable.
They definitely succeeded in doing that! My favorite part of the movie is when Hermione punches Draco in the face.
I love that part too. I have one huge question about the movie though.
What's that?
Why do they use a Time Turner to fix small mistakes, such as making sure that Buckbeak the Hippogriff doesn't get executed, but don't do it to prevent something like Harry's parents getting killed?
I really don't know. I've always kind of wondered that too. I think it might be because if they take too big of a risk with events, there's a bigger chance they'll get seen by themselves.
That does make sense. Plus, they probably wanted to make sure that the Prophecy involving the chosen one would still come true.
But couldn't Neville have been the chosen one, since he and Harry were born on the same day?
Hmm, that's true. And Neville's parents didn't die, they just got tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had me on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary

On Saturday i will see something funny

XXXXXXXXXXX
I love when I get a chance to rewatch the Harry Potter movies. Any of them really, but especially when I end up having a Harry Potter marathon and can watch several of them back to back.
Yeah, it's still hard to believe there won't be another one coming out. I got so used to there always being a new Harry Potter to see.
What's your favorite character from the movies?
I love Hagrid and McGonagall. Robbie Coltrane is the perfect Hagrid and I've love Dame Maggie Smith since I watched Peter Pan as a kid.
Same here! I wish McGonagall had as big of a part in the movies as she did in the books because I definitely wanted to see more of Maggie Smith in each movie.
I even fell for some of the actors that played awful characters too; like Helena Bonham Carter playing Bellatrix, I don't know who else could have pulled that role off so perfectly.
Oh yeah, she was fantastic as Bellatrix. Same with Timothy Spall as Wormtail; I loathe the character but he did such an amazing job with it.
I felt the same way about Alan Rickman, I think he got better and better as Snape with each movie.
I did like Rickman and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the part. I didn't really love Snape's storyline, though.
Yeah, I think he's one of those love it or hate it characters. A lot of people jumped into loving him because he died and how he died but I think that kind of misses the whole point of his character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did I ever tell you my favorite Potter villian?
No. Who?
Bellatrix Lestrange.
She is super evil!
One of my favorite actresses.
Helena Bonham Carter?
Yeah, she's good in everything she does.
Even Through the Looking Glass?
One of the movies only redeeming qualities.
You are right, there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Part 2?
I enjoyed the, I was sad to see the series end. But of course knew it had to at some point.
The series certainly spanned a long time. I find them slightly too dark.
They are dark but it is based off the books and I mean they had to start making them more adult.
I don't know that more adult equals darker, but I get what you are saying.
Did you know that in the one scene where Helena Bonham Carter is writing mudblood on Hermione they show it one one arm but then next shot it is on the other?.
Helena Bonham Carter character was Bellatrix Lestrange correct? And no I had never caught that.
Yes that is her Bellatrix Lestrange. What a good name for her role. It fits the character so well.
I think J.K. Rowling was great in her inventive effectiveness in naming all characters.
True even the simple name Ron is so perfect for his part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Name the movie that this quote is from: "You've got dirt on your nose, did you know?".
Easy, "Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone"! Hermoine says it to Ron Weasley on the train, right after they meet.
I love that you're a Harry Potter fan! Here's another: "Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light".
I can't remember which one it is from, but I know Albus Dumbledore says it to one of the kids. Which one was it again?
It's from the third one, "Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban". Dumbledore says it to the whole school!
Oh yeah, you're such a nerd! Who is your favorite character again?
I have to choose just one character? My top 5 are Fred and George Weasley, Molly Weasley, Snape, Ron and Doby!
Those are good one! Molly Weasley is my favorite!
She's such a great mom, and so funny! "Where HAVE you been?"
So funny! Remember when she sent that screamer to Ron because he stole the car? I would've died if my mom did that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that it has been ten years since the last Harry Potter book was released?
Has it been that long already? Wow!
Yes, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released in 2007.
I can't believe it has been so long.
I remember that on the day it was released, I went to the book store dressed as Professor Dumbledore.
I never dressed up for the book releases, but I did dress as Harry Potter for Halloween when I was a kid.
People always dressed up for the book releases. My mom dressed as Professor Mcgonogal once.
My mom never read any of the Harry Potter books.
My mom was a bigger Harry Potter fan than I was!
Wow, you're so lucky.
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
Aln Rickman is an amazing actor.
I love him he was the perfect casting choice to be Snape.
What's you favorite Snape scene.
I like it when in the Prisoner of Azkaban he gives hints that Lupin is a werewolf.
My favorite scene is when Hermione lights his robe on fire.
I still can't believe he ended up being one of the good guys.
Yeah even after all this time he still regretted Lily's death.
He sacrificed himself just so Harry could lived
I like how he hoodwinked on the greatest wizards ever.
That final scene with Dumbledore is just so touching.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the entire Harry Potter cast was British?
Well not all all. You know Verne Troyer who played Griphook, is an American.
Okay well all the major characters.
I heard the Duke Humphreys library where the library scenes were filmed, strictly forbids flames in the library and made an exception for the movie! First time in hundreds of years!
Yeah, well they probably got enough cash to store a whole section of old out of print books!
It would have been pretty cool to work on the set. Of course, castles are plentiful in Britain.
Yeah, the locations were amazing. I love seeing the inside of Hogwarts. It was much more vivid after seeing the movies.
Yeah, they were pretty close to what I imagined in my head.
Me too. It's still hard to believe the first movie was done in 2001!
I know right! That was 16 years ago!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose your favorite teacher at Hogwart's
Oh definitely Professor McGonagal. I love her.
She's mine too! She's so proper and elegant. I love Maggie Smith in all her movies.
Me too, she's such a cute older lady. I like Dumbledore too but he's a little more distant.
That's true. Other than the teachers I'm fond of Hagrid.
Oh so am I. He's such a sweet soul.
He really is, and always there for the kids when they need him.
He's definitely an ally. Loved him ever since he swept Harry away to Hogwart's.
Oh that was such a pivotal moment. Changed Harry's life forever.
I was just glad to see him get away from the Dursleys. They were awful people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Harry Potter book was the best? and which movie was the
The forth book and seventh books were the best.
What about the movies?
The first, second and third movies were good I've always seen bit and pieces of the rest.
I thought you were such a big HP fan?
I am. Of the books.
So what do you have against the movies?
Some of them didn't make sense and they left out a lot of important stuff.
They're movies. They're only two hours. YOu can't put in everything.
They could have put in more. They didn't try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Harry Potter movie "Prisoner of Azkaban"?
Some of the best scenes in the series are in that one.
Like what?
My favorite snapshot is when the camera slowly zooms out while Vernon and Petunia look up as Vernon's sister floats away.
I loved that one!
The slow zoom out shows Dudley covered in cake in the sun room, watching tv, as his parents pound the ground in utter humiliation and agony.
It's just beautiful and a great visual into who they are as characters and what Harry must deal with in regards to his only family.
I like how that one really got into just how awful Harry's so called family was. Really great scenery.
The new director was fantastic, and it showed immediately
I was not even aware it was a new director. The films there after did have a new feel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want an owl like harry had in the movies
Like the color
Well not just the color
like how
Like to deliver me letters and stuff
I mean you could get an owl like the movies if you train it
Yeah sure i could never do that
Well you never know
You know i could not
Have some faith in yourself
XXXXXXXXXXX

On Saturday i will see something funny

XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Harry Potter Movie?
The Half Blood Prince.
I liked that one too.  Things had gotten more serious and the world is aware of you know who.
Plus it's the one where Snape Take out Dumpledore.
That was an amazing scene.  We also got to learn a bit about old Tom Riddle in that story.
I wish we could have learned more.  Sure he's as bad as bad gets but he has an interesting story I bet.
Yeah, most bad guys do.  Like how did they become so bad?
I'd like to know that.  I also loved the adventure of Dumpledore and Harry together.
Yeah, we almost never get to see Dumpledore throw down.  That cave scene was awesome.
It was one of my favorites throughout the whole movie.  It show Dumpledore actually struggle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think your favorite professor would have been?
I don't know that's a hard one. Probably Hagrid so we could get into trouble.
Not me. I think McGonagall would have been my fave. She knew her stuff but knew how to have fun sometimes too.
You're right. She had lots on one liners especially towards the end of the book when she was pissed off with Umbridge.
Ugh. Umbridge sucks so bad.
I know I still feel so bad for Harry having to carve that crap into his hand.
He really put up with a lot from her. She was the worst.
Right. She was worse than Snape.
Yeah Snape was just mental abuse.
I don't even blame Snape anymore for anything. Now that we saw the flashbacks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I really like The Deathly Hallows, part one. Although the ending is so sad.
I agree. I cry every time I watch it when Dobby says, "Dobby is happy to be with his friends."
It was crazy to me that Bellatrix threw the knife into their Apparation just at that last minute.
I know. And Harry was so sad when he was trying to find something in Hermione's purse to save Dobby with.
Which Harry Potter movie is your favorite?
I loved the Chamber of Secrets.
Really? I think that's one of the worst ones! The change in direction was not a good move.
I just liked that we're introduced to horcruxes for the first time, even if we don't know exactly what their purpose is yet.
That's true. Plus, we get to learn more about Ginny, even though she's one of my least favorite characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Deathly Hallows do you think was better?  The first or second.
I think the first one was.
I agree, there was the story lesson about the Hallows themselves.
Yeah, the last movie was great especially the battle.  But it seemed to be all battle.
I know what you mean, it was like a huge cool battle but not many plot devices.
Except wasn't that the one where Snape revealed his memories?
Yes it was, easily one of the best scenes in the entire series.
I also liked the part where Nevel killed the snake.
That was great, Nevel became a total hero.
Just like they always said don't sleep on anyone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had me on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food

On Saturday i will see something funny

XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, what movie are we watching tonight?
I thought I'd pick up Harry Potter.
Oh good, I love it. Which one?
I want to watch Deathly Hallows, is that okay?
Uh, remind me of which one that is again!
It's the one were Snape goes in the mansion and the Death Eaters and Voldemort is at the head of the table.
Is that were he tells Snape he has to kill Harry?
Yes! That one!
Oh, that one is sad. I cried when Hermoine does the spell to make her parents forget.
Oh my gosh yes, that is so emotional!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Harry Potter movies?
Wow, that's a big question. Aren't there 8 of them? Which one do you mean?
Well, which ones are your favorite?
I thought they started getting really good around the third movie.
Not a fan of the first two?
No. They were boring. The characters are too young to be interesting. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson weren't interesting people until the third movie.
So the third it is, then?
Well, the third through the sixth. It started to fall apart after that.
Oh, why is that?
It was far too serious and about the villains by that point, I think. Snape killing Dumbledore was sort of the climax of the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Harry Potter movie?
Probably 'Goblet of Fire', but it's really touch to pick. You?
'Prisoner of Azkaban' just because of Gary Oldman.
He plays Sirius Black, right?
Yes, he does. He plays that character so well.
He's literally unrecognizable in those movies. I didn't even realize it was Gary Oldman.
I didn't either until I read it online. The caliber of actors in Harry Potter is unbelievable.
I think that speaks to the quality of the writing, both for the books and the movies.
They did a great job adapting the books.
They really did - I'm a big fan of both the books and movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like Harry Potter, right?
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?
I have just watched the films. What did you think of them?
Well, at first I was skeptical that they could live up to the books. I was suprised to see they were fantastic!
They were, weren't they? I loved them.
I am glad you got to watch them. Which was your favorite?
Well, you know I love Christmas time, so I think the Goblet of Fire.
I liked that one too. The dance that they have at Christmas time is lovely.
What movie was your favorite?
Well, that is a tough question, but I would have to say The Sorcerer's Stone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you love Harry Potter. Is there anything in the movies better than the books?
Well for one the music. It might seem a small thing but it really adds to it especially the song "Double Double Toil And Trouble!"
I love music so that sounds about right. Anything else?
Of course! The Hungarian Horntail dragon in the books stays close to her next. Not in the movies and it is a great scene!
Which movie was that one?
It's the book and the movie The Goblet of Fire.
Which order is that one in?
That's actually the fourth book and movie in the series.
But I should still watch in order and look for all the extras right?
Yes, you won't regret the time, I promise!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just got to the end of The Goblet of Fire.
What do you think so far.
I never saw the plot with Barty Crouch Jr. pretending to be Moody coming.
That was pretty insane especially since he acted just like the real Moody.
I thought it was hilarious when he turned Malfor into a ferret.
I nearly died laughing.
IT was nice how he comforted Neville.
What happened to his parents was pretty sad.
I still can't believe Cedric died though.
Me either Hufflepuff doesn't get much attention.

XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite movie series?
Harry Potter hands down.
Really?  I've seen the first one a really long time ago but I never finished it.
You have to!  I know there are a lot of them but everything about them is great.
How many movies are there?
Well, there's eight Harry Potter movies but that new movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them takes place in the same universe.  It happens before Harry Potter.
So should I start with the first Harry Potter or that new movie?
You should definitely start with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  The new one just has nods to the others that you wouldn't get if you hadn't watched them first.
Does it have any of the same actors?
No, not that I know of.  Speaking of that the casting is amazing.  Daniel Radcliffe was spot on playing Harry Potter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Dobby?
I hated Dobby, he was so annoying.
I know, basically that movies version of Jar Jar Binks.
He wasn't that bad.  And it was sad when he was killed.
Yeah, that was sad.
But he helped everyone escape.  So his sacrifice was not in vain.
Yes, not only was he a free elf, he was  brave elf.
Come to think about it, maybe I actually like Dobby.
Yeah, even though he was a bit annoying he was still a good elf.
Poor poor Dobby.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Harry Potter and Goblet of Fire.
Number 4 in the series?
Yes.
Another director from the first three?
Yes, Mike Newell.
Isn't Ralph Fiennes in that movie?
Yes, as Lord Voldemort.
Doesn't Harry like an Asian chick in this?
Cho Chang, played by Katie Leung
She was hot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could use any of the spells from the Potter movies, which would you pick?
I'd like to have that invisibility cloak.
Not really a spell....
Hmmm...mabe the Leveosa spell.
Which?
The one that make stuff float.
Oh, yeah. Why?
So I could make myself fly.
What about a broom stick.
That'd work too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that new game, Bean Boozled?
Yeah, the Jelly Belly game?
That's the one.
What of it?
It reminds me of Harry Potter.
How so?
You remember the first movie, when they're on the train?
Oh, yeah. With the gross flavored jelly beans?
Uh huh.
Your right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the third Harry Potter movie.
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban?
Yes, that's it.
A new director from the first two movies?
Right,  Alfonso Cuaron.
Who took over as Dumbledore?
Michael Gambon
Who plays the assassin?
Gary Oldman.
I remember him from Bram Stoker's Dracula!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So why did Harry break the Elder Wand?
I don't think he wanted the responsibility of it.
I took it as he didn't want anyone to have responsibility for it.
By tossing it off the bridge, he thought he could the trouble.
I guess it did work out, right?  I mean he did have a family
You mean the scene at the end at the train station?
Yeah, seems like his son was scared to go off alone.
I'm sure it was scary.  I really liked what Harry said to him though.
Makes you wonder if they'll make a movie about him.
I would pay to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
If you could be a harry potter character who would you be?
Interesting question.
Take your time.
I would be Severus.
Oh really, why?
I enjoyed his character and thought he was misunderstood.
Well he definitely was yes.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Harry Potter movies?
Sure! They're not as good as the books but they are still classics.
I know! I was disappointed in them as adaptations but I still love them.
Do you have a favorite?
I love the cinematography of the third one but I love that the last 2 got to go more in depth.
Yeah I hate that trend of splitting movies up but it worked well here.
I'm sad they cut out the scene of Harry in Dumbledore's office after Sirius' death
That was a really moving scene.
It was. I loved seeing Hogwarts come to life
Yes that was really breathtaking!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Harry Potter fan?
It's one of my favorite series!
I like it too.
Have you seen the Robot Chicken parody?
No.
Well in it Voldemort gets his nose smashed my James Potter.
That's silly.
That's why Voldemort wants to kill him.
Voldemort was a great villain
He was a big terrorist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Harry Potter character?
Harry
Why is that?
He is the main guy and I like him a lot.
Did you think the actor did a good job playing him?
Yes
Do you like Ron too?
Yes and Hermione.
Which movie do you like the least?
The last one, cause I knew it was the end and it made me sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies yet?
Of course! I love them, although not as much as the books.
Which one is your favorite?
I love Order of the Phoenix. I think it has a more wholesome idea of adventure because of the TriWizard tournament.
Really? Voldemort killing Cedric is wholesome?
No, but you know what I mean! It's more adult than the earlier movies but it's still a bit more lighthearted.
That's true. The scene with Moaning Myrtle in the prefect's bathroom made me laugh.
Oh yeah, I almost forgot about that! My favorite scene might be when we meet the students from the other schools.
I wish things had worked out differently with Viktor Krum. He was so gorgeous!
Sooo dreamy. But Hermionie and Ron are meant to be!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished Harry Potter and the goblet of Fire!
Really? What did you think of it?
Well, first of all, I didn't even know that either of the two schools existed. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons are really interesitng to watch, when competing with Hogwarts.
I know! It really was cool to find out that viktor Krum was in Durmstrang. And a Triwizard champion at that!
One of my favorite parts wsa when Harry saved not just one, but two people from the lake.
Yeah, that was rather heroic!
Cedric performed so well, didn't he?
Oh yes, he was a favorite champion, that's for sure. So many people wanted him to win.
What about the tournament itself? Did you want anyone in particular to win?
I really wanted Cedric or Harry wo win, Hogwarts all the way!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite movie?
I would probably go with the last one.
You're talking Deathly Hallows Part 2, right?
Yeah.  Part 1 was super boring.
It wasn't that bad, it was trying to build up the action.
Yeah, but how many times can you camp in the wilderness?
The whole point was to show that no place is safe.
But did we really need two hours of that?
Again, it was a slow burn.  I realize it's not for everyone.
I don't think it's for anyone.  Part 2 forever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Harry Potter film is amazing!
Which one? I thought they were finished making those.
The original Harry Potter, yes. But there are new films out!
What are they about?
Well, this one is about real-life students who attend magic school.
A bit cliche, don't you think?
Maybe, but it was a huge success at the box office.
Will they make more?
Maybe! I would reccomend you go see that one.
I do like Harry Potter films. I'll give it a shot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't think that Hogwarts should keep Slytherin house around - all the wizards that came out of there were evil.
Not all Slytherins are evil. Snape wasn't evil.
Snape wasn't evil exactly, but he wasn't actually a good guy. He treated his students really unfairly.
Yeah, but he was basically a double agent, fighting against the most powerful evil wizard in the world.
Okay, but all the other Slytherins were evil.
Do you think Horace Slughorn was evil?
He was very selfish and narcissistic.
I don't think that makes someone evil - he still tried to help his students.
He only cared about protecting himself and "collecting" students.
I still don't think that makes him evil. All people are a little selfish.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you cry in the bedroom scene after Lilly was killed??
Of course, who wouldn't. I have a heart.
Would you rather the flying car, or the timeturner?
Time turner BY far...you could go and do whatever you want.
Do you prefer The Movies or the book?
The books by far, the movies are great but they are missing so much more than whats in the books.
How many presents did Dudley originally get on his birthday before screaming at Petunia for more
36
Who was the first person to get sorted into a Hogwarts house?
In the book, Hannah Abbott
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Harry Potter, I really like the sport they play.
Quidditch?
Yes! Especially in the first one, did you like it?
When Gryffindor won the House Cup in the first movie. I will never forget how happy they were, even the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws were cheering for them too.
It was really important, it showed that the kids really had some one to cheer for.
Well, Harry was a famous person.
A famous baby. He did not really do anything until he hit school.
But, he was the reason Voldermort was underground, so a legend.
Maybe that is why all the other houses cheered him on.
Or they just really did not like Slytherin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which character do you like best in the Harry potter series
I like professor snape. He played a great role
Do you think that hermoine granger and Harry potter should have gotten together
I think the story played out like it should
What is your favorite Harry potter movie
I would have to say my favorite movie would be goblet of fire
Wasn't vodemort a pretty scary character
Yes he indeed was super crazy and scary
Would you ever like to go to hogwarts
I wou,d love to go to hogwarts
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished Prisoner of Azkaban, have you read it?
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.
Okay, so what did you think of Sirius?
I like him quite a bit, but he's a bit odd. What do you mean?
Well, the Harry/Sirius dynamic is a bit, strange.
Well, I think it would be that way with any nephew and uncle who have never really met (except when Harry was a baby).
True, I guess I just thought it seemed sudden.
It really was, but still it's essential to the story.
I just really hate Snape and how smug and haughty he was the entire time.
Yeah, Sirius definitely didn't deserve that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Harry Potter movies?
Yea, I think so. Although some of the earlier movies kind of blend into one movie in my head.
I know what you mean. The last two movies were so good though right?!
Yea, I feel like now Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint grew up a bit that their acting was so much better and so much more enjoyable.
I agree. Even the storylines for the last few movies was a lot more grown up and a lot darker.
Yea, you see certain characters that you've really grown attached to die in the final battle.
It was so sad when Fred Weasley died. And Dobby's death was super sad too.
And Hedwig! For some reason that one hit me the hardest.
I totally cried during that scene.
Me too. She was with him since the beginning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm pretty sure Voldemort has some nice qualities to him.
You're insane.
Hear me out.  He had a bad childhood, right?
Right.
He was an orphan, right?
Right.
Well, Harry was the same way so why does he get a free pass?
Because Harry was never evil at heart.
But maybe Voldemort wasn't either when he was very young.
Well, Voldemort's dead, so end of discussion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So my wife want's to watch Harry Potter tonight but I feel i'm too old to watch the movies what do you think?
No way those movies are actually just as good for adults
Really?  I thought it looked pretty lame on the trailers
No there is a lot of cool magic and visual effects
I guess I can give them a try
Just keep an open mind, even though kids are doing the magic there are also teachers that are adults and some pretty notable actors are in the series
Like who?
Gary Oldman is in at least 3 or 4 of them
Really, he's a great actor, you may have sold me on him alone
there you go, now go and enjoy the movies with your wife
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally figured out the problem. They treat Snape much more sympathetically in the movies than they do in the books.
Right? I think it's all Alan Rickman's performance, it makes him way more likable.
That and the fact that he's rarely even in the movies all that much, and when he is he's actually kind of funny.
Yeah, him hitting Harry and Ron over the heads with books shouldn't have been as funny as it was.
I just really hate how him cradling Lily's body in the last movie has been over-romantacized.
You're just saying that because there's a crying, bleeding infant in the background.
...Yes, yes that is exactly what I'm saying.
It DID make me cry the first time, I admit, but now I just kind of giggle at it.
Oh my god, did you see that one convention shot with those two cosplayers? They were a couple and they brought their baby, and they placed the baby on the ground while the guy dressed as Snape wailed over the woman dressed as Lily while she pretended to be dead.
I DID NOT SEE THAT AT ALL, YOU NEED TO SEND IT TO ME RIGHT NOW!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the Harry Potter books or movies were better?
I definitely think that the books were much better than the movies.
I like the movies because I think the actors did a really great job.
I can see that - Emma Watson was the perfect Hermione.
And Richard Harris was perfect as Dumbledore.
I still think the books were better though.
Honestly, I didn't read the books.
The books have so many more details that the movies leave out though.
Like what?
Well, they leave a lot of info out about Dumbledore's family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You think butterbeer is actually beer?
Of course not.  They would never sell that to children.
Then why do they call it that?
It is a catchy name.
That doesn't answer my question though.
I'm pretty sure it talks about why it's called that in first or second movie.
It's a shame they didn't let the kids go into town more than they did.
Maybe they could have butterbeer in a can.
I doubt they'd let them take that into Hogwarts.  It would be illegal.
Everything Harry did at Hogwarts was illegal!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I'm watching Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix and I think this is the saddest one out of all the movies.
Of course it is! I'm still not over Sirius Black getting killed.
I know! Bellatrix LeStrange is one of the best villains of our generation.
She really is, and Helena Bonham Carter is really excellent at being scary and creepy.
I wish they had let Tim Burton direct one of the movies! I think he would have brought them to an entirely new level.
Yes, he really has an eye for the fantastic. He would have been perfect to direct Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
Absolutely! I feel like the merpeople and the blast ended skrewts would have been amazing under him.
Now I'm thinking about how poor Cedric Diggory died.
Poor Cedric! He just wanted to win something for Hufflepuff!
Yeah, Hufflepuff never got any kind of glory. Sad little badgers, they never won anything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I re-watched all of the Harry Potter movies last week.
Awesome! Which one is your favorite?
I love them all, but if I had to pick one, I guess Goblet of Fire.
I like that one too, but I always cry when Cedric dies.
Me too! He is such a good character. I think the Tri Wizard tournament is fun to watch though.
Yeah, it is. I think my favorite movie is the first Deathly Hallows.
That is a good one. I'm glad it was spit up into two movies so the whole story could be covered.
Agreed! I like both of them for sure. Of course I knew Snape dies, but it is still always sad to see.
Why do so many characters we love have to die?!
I know! I get so emotional!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Harry Potter?
It's okay.
I watched the first four in the theater.
They kept getting darker.
J.K. Rowling is a great writer.
It's a great concept.
It was fun to live vicariously through the characters.
The wizards had no cares in the world.
I'd like to magic some things.
That would be nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Every single time I see the Harry Potter movies, I find something new in them.
I do too, decades in to watching them.
The whole of them are just so full.
I think one of my favorite scenes from the movies is the one where Harry, Ron, Neville and a couple other Gryffindors are sitting in the bunk room eating the different magical sweets
While so much is wrong in their world, they are just being kids.
My favorite thing about Harry Potter in general is just when they're in school and nothing is going wrong. Just magical kids being magical kids.
I love the classes and Quidditch, and all the little magical details of Hogwarts.
The moving staircases. The magical pictures.
The little details that make the place something magical, make me want to go there.
Of course, then there is the troll in the dungeon, makes me rethink wanting to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like the Harry Potter movies?
Honestly, I don't like them at all.
Why do you not like them?
I don't know, nothing that really interests me about he movies or the books.
That fine, normally a lot of people really like them.
I agree, I am normally not a person who likes what everyone else likes.
I can understand that, but if you have free time give one a try.
I tried to watch a few of these movies a few years back and I didn't like it.
I really like the movies, it is great to me.
Nice to hear, I hope they have more movies so you can enjoy them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about Harry Potter movies
Sounds good to me
I really enjoyed watching them
Me too
I like moaning myrtle
She was a good character
I love how they have ghosts at Hogwarts
And the moving pictures
Yes those are cool too
And the stairs
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yesterday I watched Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince!
Oh yeah? What'd you think?
I couldn't believe the ending! I never thought that Dumbledore was going to die.
Isn't that part wild? I think Dumbledore had it planned the entire time though.
He must have a lot of faith in Harry if he can get killed and know that things are going to work out.
Yeah. Throughout the whole series all he's really said though is to trust Harry, so he must know what he's doing.
I also liked how we're introduced to the concept of Horcruxes in this movie.
Remind me again what a Horcrux is?
It's when you split your soul into pieces to try to live forever, so even if your body dies your soul lives on and you can come back to life.
Oh that's right. Voldemort split his soul into seven parts, if I remember correctly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjpy the Harry potter movies
Yes i liked the order of the phoenix
That was when he was in the fifth year, right?
Yes it came out in 2007
That one was good
Its about time Harry learned more
Everyone treats him like a kid
Except dumbledore
Yea dumbledore expects a lot from him
Yea but harry can do it
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I hear Dumbledore is gay?
Yeah, I heard about that. Jk Rowling was all over that in an interview.
That's pretty cool. Hogwarts is in to diversity.
So you think there was anything going on with Grindlewald?
I don't know. It makes their interaction more interesting and tragic.
Yeah, it seems Dumbledore was dealing with his baggage his whole life.
Yeah, kind of makes it real.
Yeah and contemporary in way.
Never thought about that but you're right.
So many layers to Harry Potter. I get something out of it every time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Harry Potter movies have a lot of dark scenes.
They do, but also happy ones too.
Which was your favorite happy moment, in the movies?
I would say when Harry first see Diagon Alley.
In Harry Potter and The Philospher's stone?
Yes. He does not yet know of his sad past, nor the dark future ahead of him.
That is even before he meets Draco Malfoy.
Yes. All he knows is he is in a magical place.
Sort of the start of his sad journey .
The magical part at least, his whole life had been sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Harry Potter movies are there?
It depends on how you count them, though eight is probably the answer.
Weren't there seven books?
There were, but the last book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" was divided in to two parts.
Were the same actors used throughout the movies?
Mostly they were, but there were a few exceptions.  Dumbledore and one of Draco's henchmen changed.
Why did they change?
The role of Dumbledore was played by both Richard Harris and Michael Gambon due to death.
Anyone else change?
Lavender Brown did, she was only a minor character in the first couple, so it wasn't that important in the first couple because she didn't really have speaking roles, but when the later books came out and she became more important they changed her actress for the later movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched harry potter?
Yes, i have seen all of them
They are great
Definitely
One of my favorite series
Mine too
Have you read the books?
Yes ive read all the books and watched all the movies
They are really good
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, in Harry Potter, Trewlaney was usually pretty spot on.
Sometimes, others she was just nuts.
But, that is the thing. She is a great-great granddaughter of the seer Cassandra.
So, what has that to do with her crazy side.
Cassandra, in old myth, was a seer, always right, who was cursed to be seen as insane, even when people saw she was right.
What? Oh, wow , just like her!
Yes. She predicated the whole movie, in a convoluted way.
And no one believed her predictions.
Yes, just like the myth! See, she was right the whole time!
Wow, that makes a lot of sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Am I the only one annoyed at Emma Watson's eyebrows ever since the fourth movie?
Am I the only one annoyed at Emma Watson's HAIR ever since the THIRD movie?
No you are not. I HATE how pretty they made her.
The Yule Ball was supposed to be this huge transformation, but she was gorgeous already!
And not to mention she's supposed to be the poster child for brains over beauty, yet she almost jeopardizes the laws of time and space because she's upset about how her hair looks.
Steve Kloves does NOT know how to write his favorite character, does he.
Well he also tried to set her up with Harry.
Yeah, if you only watch the films, it looks like they're a way better couple.
Also remember when they were almost caught by the Snatchers because Hermione, HERMIONE, was wearing perfume?
I try not to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite scene from a Harry Potter movie?
When Harry Potter kills Voldemort in the last movie.
DId you see that coming?
Yes because the bad guys always die and the good guys always win!
DId you think it was scary?
Not really, it was a little intense though.
Does the movie end right after that?
Well, Harry Potter is married with Ginny and they have kids at the very end
Seriously?  Does it show their wedding?
No, the very end shows their kids and Ron and HErmione's kids going to Hogwarts though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you still need those Harry Potter DVD's?
Yeah, we want to binge watch them.
Ok, which ones?
Do you have at least the first three?
Yes. But what about the rest?
I think I might have the rest but when we moved I displaced them.
Okay, how about I bring the first three and then we can watch the rest next time?
Sounds like a good plan. Do you think we can watch three in one day?
I think so, if it's a weekend.
Okay, how about we watch them on Saturday?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Harry Potter movies?
Oh, yeah. I saw all of them in the theater when they came out.
Okay, so you remember what happened to Cedric Diggory, right?
Of course. That scene was absolutely heart rending.
Right? When they come out and Harry is crying over Cedric but the music just keeps playing, and everyone is clapping?
I still cry when I watch it and I've seen it like five times.
I know. The first time you see it you're just so shocked, but every time after that there is just a sense of dread before it happens.
Do you ever secretly root for him to live even though you obviously know he's going to die?
I thought I was the only one who did that!
Nope! I do it, too. Not just with Harry Potter, but with a bunch of other movies, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoy how Ron matures throughout the series
At first he tries a bogus spell on scabbers.
I like when he is late to  Transfiguration and sees Mcgonagall turn from a cat.
Yeah In the first movie him and Harry are pretty mean to Hermione
I like how when they save her from the troll he doesn't rat them out.
He then isn't afraid to help her look to find out who Nicholas Flamel is.
When they're caught in devil snare he reminds Hermione that they can use magic.
He realizes that they have to play chess in order to move on.
He knows that it's harry who has move on so he sacrifices himself
Yeah and he ends up playing one of the best games of wizard chess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Dumbledore?
What do you mean?
They changed actors in the movies.
I didn't even notice.
They were notably different.
Did you have a favorite?
The first one.
What happened to him?
I think he passed away.
That's sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I enjoupyes the Goblet of Fire
That was a good movie, i hate cedric diggory had to die though
Me too, but other than that the games were really cool
Yes, like when they had to figure out how to breathe underwater
And harry of course did it best
He has too hes the main character
Thats true
That one was the longest and by far my favorite
It was really good
Definitrly
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the horcruxes in Harry Potter?
Well, obviously they are important, what do you mean specifically?
Well, it seems like he's a bit careless with them.
Yeah, some of them didn't make sense. The snake specifically.
Also, the diary? He was very blase with leaving it about.
Yeah you would think he'd be more careful with bits of his soul.
That always kind of bothered me about it. He was so powerful, but
Yeah, so powerful, but he left himself exposed. It bothered me too.
If only he would have hidden some of them better, what could Harry have done?
That's a good question, probably nothing?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hated the second Dumbledore?
The actor or are you talking about Albus'  brother?
No, the actor.
I agree. The first one was much better. But what can you do. He died.
I know. Why did the second one always have his beard in a braid. I hated that thing.
You get upet about the smallest things.
It annoyed me.
It annoyed me that they didn't do a very good job making the movie. Dumbledore's beard, I don't really care about.
You don't like Harry Potter?
I'm not a big fan of the movies. I loved the books.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just rewatched the last Harry Potter movie. It was pretty good again.
Really? I've only seen it once.
Yeah, when it first came out I some how missed it. It would have been great to see it at the theater.
That's where I saw it. Those movies need to be seen on the big screen. You can really get sense of all the special effects.
Yeah, I love how they do animals. The dragon scene is amazing. I actually was feeling sympathetic for the CG dragon!
I know! Poor dragon.
It's such a great scene when burst through the roof of Gringots Bank and takes to air with out heros hanging on...
Yeah, that is one of my favorites too. Exactly what I imagined.
I see new details every time.
Me too. There always seems to be some little gem that missed before and it's so great. Love those movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Ron and Hermionie were meant to end up together?
Yes, of course! Why, are you a Harry and Hermionie shipper?
Well, it seemed like they were insinuating some sort of love triangle in the last two movies.
Yes, but that was really a departure from the books.
Do you prefer the books to the movies?
For the most part yes, but I am glad they made movies from the series. How about you?
I usually prefer the book the the movies in general but really like the Harry Potter films so it's tough to say.
True, I grew up with the movies so they were a big part of my childhood.
Mine as well. My friends and I would all go to the opening night dressed as wizards.
It's nice that they are rebooting the wizarding world with Fantastic beasts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man she's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which character do you think changed the most throughout the series?
Nevil for sure.
Yeah, he started out a pudgy wimp and turned out to be great.
Yes, that goes to show you always believe in people.
You know who else changed a lot?  Snape.
Well yes and no.
What do you mean no?
He always was Snape.  To us he changed, but to himself he always was a good guy in disguise.
One thing always stayed the same though.  That was Dumpledore.
Yeah, even in death he was the same old Dumpledore, kind of kind and mystical.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the entire Harry Potter series this past month and it was fantastical!
You are so lucky! I have seen them all but it has been a while. It is so magical.
Yeah, the wizards and witches and Hogwarts!
The author J.K Rowling has a fantastic mind to be able to create all of these people and worlds!
I agree that she is a genius! How did she come up with names like Albus Dumbledore?
Right, or the character, He Who Must Not Be Named.
Thats hilarious!
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was my favorite of the series, I think.
That was a great one but my pick is Harry Potter the Deathly Hallows part two because of all the answered questions.
I wonder of they will ever make another to add to the series, I hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite harry Potter movie?
The first one
The Sorcerer's Stone?
Yes. I love that.
What do you like about it?
I love the imagination that went behind the look and feel of the movie.
I agree. I love the little detalils
Yes. Plenty of details were added that really brought the movie to life.
The movies are very rich, moody, and dramatic.
Yes. Dramatic is a very good way to describe the movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did it ever bother you how whiny Harry is in the fifth book?
Yes, immensely.
He is a teenager, though, and puberty does have that effect.
He spends the whole book complaining and trying to thwart the rules.
If Dumbledore had explained to him, he probably would have understood.
Can a teenager really understand reason?
If anyone could, it would be Harry.
I don't think Sirius helped, though.
He wasn't a very good example, and I think he paid for it with his life.
That was brutal, but an apt metaphor for the horrible things that happen to people for no good reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the harry potter movies compared to the books.
I think overall they did a really good job with the basic plot, but they could have done better in some of the finer details.
True.  I know they had to cut some stuff due to the length of the books, but some of the changes they made didn't make sense.
Yeah, i have always hated their ending of the 8th movie.  Voldemort just kind of disintegrated.
And i liked harry repairing his wand with the elder wand in the book better than him just breaking it in the movie.
and in the book the portrait of dumbledore in the office was a nice thing to see.  the movie skips that completly
I really wish peeves had been in the movies as well.  he was such a funny character.
Yeah, i was really surprised when they excluded him from the movies.  he played an important part in some of the scenes in the books.
I am really looking forward to the fantastic beasts trilogy.
Me too.  it will be nice to see some of dumbledore's back story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Potter spin off?
The Creatures movie?
Yeah, that's the one.
No, not yet.
I figured you would, being such a Potter buff.
It's on the bucket list. Any good?
Yeah, it was alright.
Just alright?
Not as good as Harry Potter.
I could have guessed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, was Snape a good guy or a bad guy?
Snape was a good man who did bad things.
Doesn't answer the question.
Okay then, maybe he was a bad man who did good things.
Still doesn't answer the question. Was he a good guy or not? A hero or not?
He was absolutely a hero. He ended up giving his life to help Harry and the cause. So he was absolutely a hero
But what about how mean he was, how he abused harry?
That was personal. when he saw Harry, he saw Lily and blamed Harry for what happened to her.
So, everything Snape did is forgiven because of Lily?
No. But some of it can be overlooked. Harry forgave him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Harry Potter series?
Yes I have, why?
I just finished watching it, who was your favorite character?
Probably Hermoine, I can relate to her.
Why is that?
Well she's a girl first of all and she doesn't back down or let anyone step on her toes.
That's true you never did take anything from anyone.
She's tough and that's why I like her.
Yes she is.
She's also gorgeous she's the triple threat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love how magical this movie series is
You didnt
Yes i did
That was a perfect pun
I know why i did it
We need to rewatch the movies again
Well then let me get some popcorn
Ok this will be a perfect weekend
Yes it will
Do not forget all the snacks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, I’m going to a costume party with the theme of Harry Potter movies, so I need to come up with something.
Did you want to go as person or as an object?
I wanted to maybe go as one of the female staff as I am a mature lady.
Could you pull off a Professor Sprout outfit?
I am a mature lady who is not thin so we have the same body type.  What do you suggest?
Professor Sprout’s costume in “Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets” has a brown robe made up of burlap-style material, but almost any graduation gown that isn’t black could be dyed brown.
What else would I need for that costume?
She has lots of greenery poking out of her collar, wand, and hat top and such. You could use probably any combo of dried or fresh or silk plants and flowers.
She also wear gardening gloves, and if you are going for her look in the first movie must have large earmuffs.
Weren't they funny colored, like maybe pink?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I've read all the Harry Potter books, and now I want to watch the films. Are they any good?
I really loved the first three, but then they kind of taper off.
I can't wait to see what they did with Hogwartz and everything.
Chris Columbus directed the first film, and it's really good.
I hope they didn't change too much.
They were actually really faithful to the original series. Who was your favorite character?
Well, Harry of course. I can't believe how mean his parents were to him.
Well yeah, but you know they weren't really his parents.
They acted like total ghouls to him!
I know. I think they were afraid of his powers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had me on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the scene in the Sorcerer's Stone when Harry puts on the sorting hat?
Yeah! He almost gets sorted into Slytherin right?
Yeah! But then the hat decides to put him in Gryffindor.
Just like his parents James and Lilly!
What house do you think you'd be sorted into?
I think I would be Ravenclaw because I love to read. How about you?
Slytherin I think because I'm not nice enough to be a Gryffindor.
Really? I think you'd be a Hufflepuff like Cedric Diggory.
Maybe! What does it mean to be a Hufflepuff?
It means you are a loyal friend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the fact that the kids at Hogwarts were always seemingly in danger?
Well, you know it's a movie. They wouldn't have it set up like that in real life.
That's true. I just thought they would have made more provisions knowing there were huge trolls in the area.
Yeah you're right about that. But the kids fought them off bravely.
Yes they did. I loved the life size game of chess in the first movie.
Right, Slytherin House was upset about losing to them that year for sure.
They were but Gryffindor did deserve to win the House Cup. They put their lives in danger.
I know that's right. Malfoy was a victim of bad circumstances but I still never liked the boy.
Oh I don't think anyone did. He hated on Harry so much.
He really did. All that money and power he had you'd think he'd be a little happier.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy Harry Potter books?
No but I like the movies
What's your favorite movie then?
I like the 4th one
What's that one called?
It's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
Why is that your favorite?
It is the first movie that has a lot of action, in my opinion
Yeah that's true.
Plus it has the guy from Twilight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What was your favorite harry potter?
Movie or book?
Movie.
I like the prisoner of azkabahn.
That was a really great one.
Yeah loved it.  What about you?
I don't think I have a favorite.
oh okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched The Half Blood Prince again yesterday.
Oh, I love that movie, it's the best one.
It's really good, but with Voldemort's rise, and Draco Malfoy's dark experiences, it gets darker.
I feel as though seeing Draco Malfoy sad and desperate, like after Harry attacks him in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, makes him more relatable, not darker.
He still ends up following the Dark Lord though. He's just too scared to kill Snape in the end.
He regrets it though. He's so sad and stressed out after taking the Dark Mark. You just don't know it until the end of the movie.
It's still a choice though.
He and his parents were sort of forced into it with Voldemort's threats. And Lucius wasn't the greatest parent, letting him have whatever he wanted, even all those brooms.
I don't remember Voldemort specifically killing them, though.
He would though. Remember how his followers shamelessly murdered the Muggles on that bridge in the beginning of the movie?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite part of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?
I love when Harry is in the zoo with the Dursley family and he accidentally lets the snake loose.
I like that part too! That's the first time Harry realizes he can talk to snakes.
I also like when Harry, Ron and Hermione have to fight past all of those different challenges to find Professor Quirrell and fight Voldemort.
That part used to scare me when I was little, especially when Voldemort and Quirrell separate from each other and Voldemort's soul is flying around the room.
I can see how that would be scary. Who's your favorite character in the movie?
I really like Hagrid. He just seems so jolly and I can tell he's going to be a big part of the rest of hte movies.
I like Hagrid too. I also think I like Snape.
Snape? How come? He's the meanest character in the whole movie!
I'm not sure why I'm drawn to him. I just feel like there's more to him than the eye can see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best part of the Harry Potter series?
I don't know if I could pick! But one of my favorite things is how much Snape loves Lily. It makes me so sad at the same time though.
Why do you think that?
His love for Lily really dictates how he acts throughout the entire series. Ultimately, all of his actions are to protect Harry because he's the last piece of her that he can ever hold onto.
He does a really good job of hiding that love, though. I just think of when Snape is trying to teach Harry Occlumency and he's being so mean when he goes into his memories.
Yeah, he was being mean. But Harry is mean too. He gets into Snape's mind and sees some of his earliest memories as well.
I think that Snape really wanted Harry to see some of his earlier memories, especially when he was dying. He pulled them out of his brain in his last minutes and Harry watched them in the Pensieve.
I think that's one of the defining moments of Snape's character for me. You really get to see what was going on in his brain the entire time.
I think one of the biggest turning points for me is when Dumbledore gets killed.
I think so too. You can tell that he knew he was going to get killed, but he had planned everything out so that it would be okay even after his death.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, the first time Harry goes the the Weasleys' house in the Chamber of Secrets, it looks like he feels like he is probably home.
Yes, it's so homey and comfortable messy in the Burrow. They did a great job on the set design.
And Mrs Weasley is the perfect mother figure, even if she yells at her kids a lot.
Mr Weasley balances her out. He doesn't care if his kids fly a car or not.
He thinks it's really cool actually.
And he's a supportive father even as his kids go off to fight Voldemort.
He's just crushed when Fred dies, though.
They all are. Fred was an integral part of the family.
Imagine George making a joke after his death. It just wouldn't be the same.
They'd still be homey and welcoming, but they'd be missing something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Harry Potter movie?
I like the first one the most!
Why is that?
I really like the sense of wonderment and the discovery of magic. What's your favorite?
Well I like the change of direction in 3!
Yea that's definitely when it got more serious.
What's your least favorite?
I would say the second one, it just didn't hit home as well.
Yea that makes sense, the characters were kinda jokey for the serious situation.
Yea, and 5 was much better as a book than a movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I likee harry potter
I think its the only series where the movies are as good as the books
Thats very true
I read and watched them all
Me too
We had a harry potter movie marathon at my house
That sounds like so much fun
It was fun to watch them all like that
Your whole family likes harry potter?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Snape was the best character by far in Harry Potter.
I would say Dumbledore.
What are you talking about?  Snape was the most conflicted and had the best backstory.
But so did Dumbledore.  Like Snape, he grew up under harsh conditions.
It helped that Alan Rickman was just that good as Snape.
I have to give him credit, he was awesome in every movie.
Snape also had all the best lines.
Well, not necessarily.  Dumbledore had some catchy ones as well.
I still cry when Snape says 'Always.'
Yeah, that was heartbreaking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's a Harry Potter Marathon on today! Squee!
Oh my God, I love HP marathon days. What number are they on now?
Right now, number 3. Prisoner of Azkaban.
Oh yeah! My favorite is up next!
Why is Goblet of Fire your favorite?
It's so exciting, and sad all at the same time.
Yeah, it's one of my favorites as well. I love it when they get to the Triwizard Tournament scenes.
And the part in the graveyard when Cedric Diggory dies. Ugh, makes me cry every time.
Looks like an HP and pajama type of day. Wanna come over and join me on the couch?
Um, yeah! I'll bring my pjs and some snacks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the Harry Potter movies was your favorite?
You know I really liked the Prisoner of Azkaban. That movie and book marked a poignant time in the characters direction.
Yeah, it definitely took a turn for the dark. I kind of think as far as the movies, the first was really good.
It was. The special effects were amazing. I really enjoyed seeing everything I imagine happening before me.
the special effects kept getting better and better I thought.
I thought so too.
My only question is that when they could do all these things and it look so good. Why did Voldemort look so lame?
I know right? He is not what I imagined either.
If they can put a dead guys face on someone else....
I know! And they've done it several times! I think they missed the mark on that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you know the harry potter universe?
Like all the movies?
Yeah.
Yeah I saw them.
Do you have a favorite character?
I don't think so. Do you?
I really liked Hermione.
She's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched the whole Harry Potter series again this weekend.
Again? What is that, like four times this year?
I can't help that I love them! Harry, Hermione, and Ron are like friends to me.
What's your favorite part of the series?
The third movie used to be my favorite one because I love the time traveling aspect of it, but now I think I like Half-Blood Prince more.
Why the  sixth one?
I like that Dumbledore starts to tell Harry the things he needs to defeat Voldemort.
That's definitely the most intricate and interesting part of the series.
Exactly! There's so many different details that have to happen to make it all work.
I'm sure you'll watch it again soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish I had a fast broom.
So you could sweep faster?
No.  Imagine having a broom you could fly around on.
Like a witch?
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about Harry's super deluxe broom he got as a gift.
Oh yeah, the one his uncle gave him.  Very cool.
I would fly everywhere on that thing.  It wouldn't be just for Quidditch.
I think it would be uncomfortable.
You think so?
Sure.  Have you ever sat on a broom before?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just rewatched the Chamber of Secrets, and I have some issues with it.
I bet I already know what they are, but shoot.
How in the world did no one know a CHAMBER was sitting inside the school the whole time?
Haha, let it out. It bothers me too.
Well, I guess they kind of knew, because it had been opened before. But then why didn't Dumbledore destroy it?
That bothers me so much. Let's just keep this really odd killing chamber in the school and hope for the best.
Exactly, with the top minds in the Magical kingdom thinking it's okay, I mean come on.
Yeah anyone could see that's a terrible idea.
And, who the heck would EVER hire Lockhart? That whole book/movie was just a set of contradictions.
Well no one wanted the job, so let me pick the absolute worst candidate in history, because why not? Haha
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is something that bothers you about the characters in Harry Potter?
Well, I always thought the Ginny transformation was quite abrupt.
What do you mean?
Well, she went from all shy to being an absolute badass.
Yeah, that's true, but I think that happens to a lot of kids once they reach a certain age,
I get that, but you would have thought they would have eased us into it a bit more.
True. In the course of one summer (between books) she became completely opposite.
Exactly. I love her character and feel like it was necessary though.
Also, do you think the Harry and Ginny romance was tacked on?
I don't know, I always kind of rooted for it, so I might be biased though,.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The happiest part of the movies for me is the epilogue, seeing everyone send their kids off on the train and everything is calm.
That's my favorite part too. I love when Harry reassures Albus Severus.
I think that Albus Severus and James are both happier versions of the people they are named after.
Yes, exactly. Albus is so reassured by his dad that he's not afraid of being in Slytherin.
It's like Harry gets to be the dad he always wished he had.
It's cool to see how Ron and Hermione are so proud of their kids. Ron is finally confident and Hermione is probably famous and still hardworking.
Their kids seem like they are all best friends on the train.
What about Scorpius Malfoy?
His parents seem like they are very loving too. They hug him.
Yes, the vibes in the epilogue do seem like Draco Malfoy would be a better parent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the best Dumpledore moments were throughout the series?
I liked when he made that escape during Order of the Phoenix.
That was pretty awesome.  How about his grand mater plan in Snape's Memory?
Yeah, like when he had Snape begging for mercy?
Don't forget when he fought off all those creatures in the cave with Harry.
For sure, and when he died.  That made me feel so bad for him.
Until later you find out he was already going to die and he master minded it.
That was amazing.  Dumpledore is always ten steps ahead.
He also seemed to hold his own against Voldemort in the Ministry dual.
Yes, clearly he's the man.  But he couldn't get past those horcuxes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the firework scene in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix?
Yes I do, why?
I was just thinking about fireworks and the part where Fred and George came to mind.
That's such a good part.
Yeah it is especially when they started shooting fireworks everywhere and made Ron, Harry and Hermoine laugh.
Weren't some people scared too?
Yes, Draco, Crabbe and Umbridge I think.
That's right I remember her running in terror.
Yeah that was a funny part, they're just fireworks.
I know right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I watched the first Harry Potter movie again yesterday.  It's the first time I've watched it in years.
Me too!  I think it's the best one they made.
Yeah, when everyone got older it just seemed a little strange.
The last movies seemed to take a darker, more serious tone too.
They weren't as fun as the first one was.
The first movie really was inspiring.  It made me dream about what it would be like to live in that world.
It made everybody want to live in that world too.  It had more hope in it.
Also, it made me hope Hermione and Harry would get together.
I did too. I think they made a better couple.
I want to watch that movie again today!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Question: Who was more wrong by Harry - Snape or Dumbledore?
What in the world are you talking about? Snape was always horrible to Harry. How can you say Dumbledore was wrong?
Did you not finish the series? In Snape's flashback it is explained that Dumbledore was basically raising Harry like "a pig for slaughter."
Ok yes that's a good point. But still, it's Dumbledore we are talking about!
That doesn't negate all he did.
He didn't do it because he was evil. It was necessary in his mind to save all of the world! He loved Harry.
I don't call that love.
I don't call how Snape treated Harry love. He took care of Harry all that time only because he was Lily's son.
Yes but which is worse?
Snape will always be worse.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Daniel Radcliffe was a great choice for harry potter.
Yes he was a great choice
He is a really good actor
Emma watson is a good hermoine too
Yes this movie made really good casting choices
Daniel radcliffe and emma wataon make a great team together
Yes they do
I love these movies
Me too, i wiah they had more
I know i can never get enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
The second one in the series?
Yes, directed by Chris Columbus.
Isn't Richard Harris in that?
Yes, as Dumbledore.
But he's gone now, right?
Yes, he died shortly before release of the fim.
Too bad.
John Cleese is still there, though.
A great comedian.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best Hermoine line from the Harry Potter films?
I think I loved every single thing she said in those movies.
She was always the voice of reason.
My favorite bit is in the beginning where hermione goes I'm going to bed before you get us killed or worse expelled cracks me up every time.
She gets so corrupted by the end of the films.
By the end, she is brewing illegal potions and doing all sorts of things she should not be.
I loved when she punched Draco!
That was gold. She just loses her usual cool, and bam!
He looks so lost. Like he did not believe she would.
She had to deal with so much, and be called a "Mud-blood".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your all time favorite Harry Potter Character?
Harry, duh....
Really mine is Snape.
Oh you got to be kidding. Why Snape?
Because he is the ultimate conflicted character. He's bad and good.
No he's not. He just a jerk that has issues. And he cause the death of Harry's parents.
I suppose you would see it that way, but he did make up for past mistakes.
You think? Tell that to Harry...growing with the Dursley's and always having Voldemort trying to kill him. At least Voldemort let him finish school each year.
Yeah, it was good of him. That's what make Snape great, he didn't buy in to the Harry worship.
No he was just jealous....of Harry, James, everyone....bitter old man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I've never seen the Harry Potter movies.
Really? By 2017 you haven't seen ANY of the movies?
No. I've read the books so many times I'm worried it will ruin it.
Only if you go into the movies expecting the same thing as the books, word for word, scene for scene.
Does that not happen?
Well, in the first book they almost match it up scene for scene, but they cut out some of the stuff at the end when they are trying to get to the stone.
Really? That sucks. I love that part of the book.
Yeah, but there is SO much they get right. And some much that the books don't have.
Really? Like what.
The music. Right off the bat, it adds so much to it. Plus the detail that they put into all of the shots. My visit of Hogwarts couldn't compare to the movie version.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the last Harry Potter movie?
I think it was good but there was a few weird parts.
What do you mean?
I didn't like Voldemort's character very much, the actor wasn't what I pictured for Voldemort.
I know what you mean, he wasn't my favorite actor. What did you think about Daniel Radcliffe?
I think it's so great that you see him growing up throughout the series.
Yeah, it's crazy watching all the kids get older as the movies go on.
Now I can't picture any of those actors in anything else!
True, I always see Emma Watson as Hermoine in all of her movies.
Definitely one of my favorite series ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who's your favorite Harry Potter character?
Severus Snape.
What?! He was a nasty character who bullied Harry and his friends for years!
Yes, but he was also trying to protect them even though the experience was extremely painful for him.
Okay, I know it wasn't easy, but did he have to be so mean?
Harry was a living, breathing reminder of everything he'd lost. You can't blame him for having negative feelings toward him.
Yeah, maybe that's true.
Besides, he couldn't have been nice to Harry, even if he'd wanted to.
Why do you say that?
Because hating Harry, or at least pretending to, was a crucial part of maintaining his cover with Voldemort.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm watching all the Harry Potter movies over again.
Oh awesome! I always see something new every time I do.
Wasn't Dumbledore the absolute worst?
Yes! What a master manipulator. I'm pretty sure Grindewald broke up with him because he was so passive aggressive.
Wait, didn't they duel over that whole, "For the greater good" thing?
Yeah, but I'm betting the backstory in the next Fantastic Beasts film shows quite a bit more of it.
I really like Dumbledore though.
You don't get on tumblr much do you? Dumbledore was the worst. He justified leaving a child in an abusive home.
Dumbledore was just trying to protect Harry.
Dumbledore was protecting Dumbledore. I'm telling you, he was the worst.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you seen that last Harry Potter movie yet?
Yes I finally saw it a couple of weeks ago. A friend of mine has the set and let me borrow it.
So what did you think? Was it the ending you were expecting?
Well, the good guys won. That's always a plus. And it was interesting how they got there.
Yeah, the dream scene with Dumbledore was good. Harry was really scared to meet Voldemort until he talked to him and got a better understanding of the events.
It was really unexpected to see some of the people who turned out to be allies in the end. Malfoy's mother really could have changed the whole ending if she had told Voldemort the truth about Harry.
I know it seems like that family is always surprising people when it comes to the side they are really on. When it comes down to it, I think they are on their own side.
I couldn't agree more. The ending when Malfoy and Harry saw each other at the train station when they were sending their children off to Hogwart's. They gave a little nod to each other. That kind of said it all.
I guess it really did. Maybe a you stay on your side and I'll stay on mine.
Maybe. Or maybe a hey, how are you after all these years?
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite part of Harry Potter is the sorting ceremony
That part is cool
The hat is so neat
It is, i love how you can hear what its thinking
Me too
And he can hear what your thinking
Oh yea
When harry was saying not slytherin
And the hat heard him
So he got put in griffindor
XXXXXXXXXXX
My husband and I finished all of the Harry Potter movies finally. Out of curiosity, who was your favorite character?
I have always been a traditional Harry fan myself. He is just such a dynamic character.
True, he is. I guess he is probably a lot of people's favorite.
Well who is your favorite?
You know, I would have to say my favorite was Draco Malfoy.
What? I don't know anyone else who would say Draco Malfoy is their favorite.
Personally, I find him relateable. I do not think he is a bad person, just someone who wants to please his family.
I guess I never thought of Draco like that. He is just a kid who is stuck between what is right and what his family wants.
However, as far as funny characters-Hermione!
She is a hoot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Potter films?
2 or 3 times at least!
Your quite the fan.
I grew up with the books, so....
I never read a one.
You should.
Are they as good as the movies.
Better, in my estimation.
Could I borrow one from you?
Of course!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard theyr'e coming out with some more Potter spin offs.
Not more!
Why not?
I didn't really care for the Fantastic Creatures movie.
I thought that was great!
At least they won't do that again.
I think they're doing a sequel.
Great! Why can't they leave well enough alone.
Money!
True that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I re-watched the first Harry Potter movie today!
Oh, fun. Did you like it?
Yeah, Hermione is my favorite. I can't believe I never watched these before!
Me either, but there's no time like now to catch up.
Haha, yeah. Who's your favorite character?
I think Neville was my favorite by the end.
How come?
You'll see, he's kind of like a version of Harry that's more like a regular person. Like if things had gone differently.
Didn't his actor get super hot or something?
Oh, you mean Matthew Lewis? Yeah, he did, that doesn't hurt, but it's not until the last movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the first Harry Potter movie?
I did, I thought it was good but probably the weakest one.
I can see that.  But you have to start simple in a series, after all they were just kids.
Yeah I know.  I still like it, just not as much as the later movies.
It was pretty cool how they hid Voldy in that guys turban.
Yeah that was pretty amazing, I would have never even expected that in a million years.
And that guy acted like such a putz the whole time.  Turns out he was much smarter than anyone let on.
I know, and a lot stronger.
It also shows how wizards are seduced by Voldy and his promises.
And that there are plenty of enemies waiting in the winds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are thier any good thiller moviers out now
Over the weekend i watch harry potter
Yeah man he's good
It had on the edge of my seat
Everything exspecally when he lock her in the basement for 6 month with no food
It wasn't funny at all just creepy
It was really scary
And creepily
On Saturday i will see something funny
But this movie was not bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not a big Harry Potter fan.
I don't really get the hype either.
I have seen a couple of the films, but they don't do much for me.
Me either.
I did like Alan Rickman's character.
Yes, he straddles the line between good and bad very well.
It seems as though movies and tv shows about magic are very popular these days.
Yes, JK Rowling really tapped into something there with the Harry Potter series.
I have to confess it might be kind of fun to go to a school like Hogwartz.
It would be fun to learn spells and incantations, if they were real.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just finished Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
What did you think of Umbridge?
I hated her.
She definitely deserved what she got.
I liked the scene where Fred and Georgia just fly out during the middle of their exams.
The fireworks they chase Umbridge with are so cool.
I also though the ending was pretty sad.
Sirius Black is one of my favorite characters
I wish he could've spent more time with Harry.
At least he died laughing and trying to protect Harry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what did you think about the last Harry Potter movie?
It was very good, I was sad for the whole movie set to be over though.
I know the feeling, it's so easy to get emotionally involved in all of the movies!
At least I have the whole set now and can rewatch them when I want.
So jealous! I've been wanting to get my hands on the movies set, myself.
You can order it online like I did. You won't regret it.
I'll have to do that. So what was your favorite character throughout the whole film.
I honestly loved Dumbledore more than any of the characters, he was so wise and kind (most of the time).
He was one of my favorite too, but I loved Harry Potter, personally.
Yeah, I was just so sad when Dumbledore died...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Harry Potter films?
I've seen all except the Deathly Hallows.
So you don't know what happens to Voldemort at the end of the series?
I'm pretty sure Harry Potter wins, but I don't know for sure.
Who do you think that Harry Potter ends up marrying after leaving Hogwarts?
I'm guessing Ginny Weasley, but I'm not sure.
Well, without giving anything away, a lot of people get killed in the Deathly Hallows. Whose death would you hate the most?
I would definitely hate it if Hagrid were to die.
Do you think Snape will turn out to be good or bad?
I definitely think that Snape is evil. However, I hope he redeems himself in the last movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have to admit, I had mixed feelings on some of the casting for the Harry Potter movies.
You don't like Daniel Radcliffe?
Oh no, he's great! I also thought that Ron and Hermione were perfectly cast.
Dumbledore, too.
Oh, for sure! The ones I struggled were some of the minor characters, especially Lily.
You didn't like her?
Oh no, it's not that I disliked her. I just didn't think they chose the right actress for the part.
Why do you say that?
She and Harry were supposed to have the same eyes and she died really young. The actress who played her was much older and her eyes were nothing like Daniel Radcliffe's.
Yeah, I can see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Harry Potter movies?
Yes.  I have also read all the books.  They have so much going on in them.
Yes.  There are a lot of side stories.  Which was your favorite book?
I have to admit that I really liked the first one the best.  I believe it's called Chamber of Secrets.
That was a good one.  I really like the part where they were playing chess with those big chess pieces.
I think I liked the part best when Hagrid came and got Harry for the first time.
His aunt and uncle were a little surprised, weren't they?
I always think there is something special about the first in a series of movies.  They seem more original.
I have to say that the visual effects in the movie got even better as the movies went along.
I agree.  I do hate that the series is over.  I enjoyed watching them so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe that Harry Potter actually ended up with Ron's sister?
Yeah, it was a bit surprising, because I couldn't tell they liked each other through most of the movies.
Can you believe how many people actually love the Harry Potter series?
Yeah, its pretty unreal. I think everyone I know has seen all of the movies.
It's awesome because it really instills imagination in peoples hearts.
It really does, it makes people think more creatively and imaginitive.
What is your favorite spell from the movie?
Fortuna Major, because it has basically become a meme, and people laugh when you say it randomly.
My favorite spell is Wingardium Leviosa, it just sticks out in my head, plus its a cool spell.
Yeah I remember that one too, Hermione Granger says it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
