I'm debating whether or not I should give Lecrae a listen. I've heard conflicting reports about whether he's just a Christian who happens to rap or someone who does Christian rap and I don't want anything preachy.
He's no more preachy than any other artist. Everybody's art will be from their own perspectives and experiences and lifestyles and faith just happens to be a big part of his life.
So you're familiar with him?
Yeah I've listened to his music but not lately.
So you won't even listen to him but you're defending him?
I do like him as a person and as an artist, and though it seems like that should mean I like his music, it just doesn't appeal to me aurally.
The style, or..?
The style I guess, his voice seems a lot higher pitched than anybody else I like, and I just lean towards a more old school sound.
Doesn't sound like anything bad.
No not at all, give him a listen. There's bound to be content you disagree with but you'll find that with every artist.

Man do you think tupac is still alive
Why do you keep on that
Well i am asking?
Do you think elvis is alive
Probably not
Well that is your answer
No fair
Its all fair game
I mean just he could have survived the bullets
That many nah
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to start listening to rap but I don't know what's good. Could you give me some recommendations?
Oh I'd love to. The irish underground rap scene has some solid artists like Terawrizt, Redzer, Nucentz, etc.
Good to know. Anything in particular I should listen to of their to get a feel for them?
As far as specific songs, I can't recommend enough It's Politics, Let Us Pray, Be Ok, Devilish Nightmares and Don't Forget. Start with any of those and you'll probably want to listen to more.
Okay cool! I'm really into Irish music, any others I should listen to?
Well Scary Eire is pretty popular as far as Irish rap groups. You may like their more raw and humorous sound in contrast to the artists that "Class A'z" consists of's polished and serious sound.
Nice, and if I want to discover some more local, American artists? I feel left out because I don't know any.
You can't go wrong with Naughty By Nature, Public Enemy or Tupac. They should give you a solid foundatinal idea of what good rap is supposed to sound like.
Best songs or albums of theirs?
My personal tastes are Everythings Gonna Be Alright by Naughty By Nature, Can't Truss It, Give It Up and Miuzi Weighs a Ton by Public Enemy, and Trapped, Violent and Soulja's Story by Tupac. Enjoy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Heard any rap music lately?
I have heard a lot of stuff by Biggie Smalls.
What song is your favorite?
Big Poppa. That is classic.
I agree. I like all of his albums really.
Me too. He was my favorite rap artist.
I think Diddy did a great job producing his songs.
He definitely did.
Maybe his son will start an album of his own.
That would be nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it just me or is it really hard to understand rap lyrics unless you have them written down right in front of you?
Well all these modern artists mumble.
No I mean even classic ones.
I haven't really noticed.
I think it's just there's a lot going on at one time.
Yeah, like for me I mainly listen to Irish artists so there's a whole range of accents there plus they have entirely different slang. Those are the things that get me.
I gotcha. I just feel like I can deal with a lot of clever word play or really fast speed of delivery but it's hard to keep up with both.
That makes sense.
So I usually will read all the lyrics before listening to an album for the first time and then read them again while I'm listening.
I do too except there are some songs I just can't find the lyrics for anywhere. So I end up understanding about one more line each time I listen to a song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hip Hop music. What happened to it?
It got too mainstream I guess and oversaturated in the market.
I guess. The hip hop of today isn't anything like it was back in the 1990's.
No, it's not. It seemed more from experience and real life back then, unlike the commercialized garbage of today.
Yes. Dr. Dre and Snoop Dog and Tupac definitely were real.
I think some time a few years later, things started to go south.
Who do we blame for that?
I kind of blame Puff Daddy and people like Will Smith who made hip hop too pop-ish.
I could see that. Puff Daddy and Will Smith seemed to make hip hop more for the sense of just putting out music instead of putting out music from real life experiences.
For sure. Hip hop isn't the only genre to suffer from the change of the century into today's music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Big Sean's new album?
The one that came out this year? Yeah.
I personally think it's his best work.
I agree. I'm surprised it doesn't get more radio play.
It seems to be like that with certain rap artists.
Yeah, they can make the best music and still get no radio play.
If the song doesn't have a hook it usually won't get played.
True, a lot of his stuff doesn't really fit the radio song structure.
Yeah, It's just a lot of clever rapping with very little singing parts.
At least no one can say he's selling out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about artists like Future
I think artists like him are distorying the community
How when all his done is rap and make music
Its the message that he raps about I havent heard him talk about anything positive just killing and drugging
Its not his fault he was raised in an enviorment like that You rap about what you know about
Who said he lived like that most of these rappers are lying Tyga grew up in a rich neighborhood he knows nothing about a struggle
You got to admit His songs be everywhere tho even kids be singing in
yes that the problem even kids be singing if they singing about killing and drugs
How is that furures fault tho parents should control what the kids listen too
When are the artists gonna take some responsiblity and actually rap about something positive
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap?
yes, I do, I love it, I think LL cool J is my favorite
Oh ya, he is awesome, whats your favorite song from him?
I would have to say "doin it".
Yes, thats a great one. Do you listen to wrap often
I listen a couple times a week, I like it when I am working out or doing yard work
Thats a great idea, the beat would keep you moving for sure
It does, and sometimes my neighbors catch me singing or dancing
oh man thats hilarious
and embarrasing
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who has had the best album of 2017 so far?
That's tough. It's got to be Drake or Kendrick Lamar.
I forgot that Drake dropped "More Life" this year. I was gonna say Kendrick, hands down.
Yeah Big Sean put out "I Decided" too.
Every song I have heard off of that is really good, too.
It's been a good year for rap albums.
So which do you think was best? I'm still going with Kendrick.
I'm actually going to stick with Drake. Although, "Humble" is a crazy track.
Definitely my favorite on the CD.
"DNA" is good too. Still, Drake is the king of hip hop right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am a big fan of Jay-z  what about you buddy do you like Jay-z  rap songs?
Jay-z is okay he has a lot going on these days besides just the rapping.
What do you mean by that? what is he doing lately that i don't know about?
Well Jay-z has done lots of businesses and Philanthropy he has designed sneakers and clothes.He has also helped lot's of individuals become successful.
Wow that's cool and I like his music too. Bonnie and Clyde drove me crazy I played it so much.I dogged it.
They already had one child it was a girl they named it blue Ivy and now they are having twins did she have them yet?
I believe so i think they are still in the hospital I know she will be happy when they get out. They have a great Dad.
Yeah they are still together and most of the stars don't have much to loose or worry about with their loot they have.
True with all the businesses and music they have made with both of their fortunes the kids will never have to go broke.
Nope they sure won't Jay-z is always moving up doing more and more in the celebrity world he is a very talented man and so is his wife.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's do some rap trivia, yeah?
Alright. Go for it.
There was only one feature on The Notorious BIG's "Ready to Die". Who was it?
Wait, there was a feature? I always thought it was just him.
Well, there's one other artist. Give me your best guess.
Puff Daddy?
He produced the thing, but wasn't actually a featured artist.
I don't know, man. Who was it?
Method Man. He was on the song "The What."
From Wu-Tang? How did I not know this earlier?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Dr. Dre?
I do! He is an excellent rapper and producer.
Did you know that he helped make Eminem famous?
I do! Eminem raps about their relationship a lot.
Dr. Dre also helped the career of Kendrick Lamar a lot too.
Wow! He has really helped shape the face of rap music.
He has a great ear for talent and a lot of connections.
I am not surprised to hear that. People speak very highly of him in magazines and on TV.
I wonder who he will get behind next.
I can't wait to find out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Earl Sweatshirt's music?
Oh yeah. Earl is a genius.
His wordplay is crazy.
I agree, his stuff is really emotional too.
It definitely has a sense of honesty to it.
What's your favorite song by him?
I personally always liked "Hive".
That's a good one.
Although his verses on "Rusty" are ridiculously good.
That was actually the first song I ever heard by him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider The Beastie Boys to be rap?
They were a rather unique act, largely hardcore punk early in their career, absolutely rap influenced in the middle and later, would say more hip hop.
Hip hop is a good way of putting them I would think, how did you like them?
They were good, but I'm more into things like Run DMC.
Wow that's a group I've not listened to in ages, classic stuff though
Classic as it gets, was a shame what happened to Jam Master Jay though.
Didn't he die sadly?
He did was shot and killed.
Wow that's awful, it seems sometimes the greats go too early.
Yeah it's a shame, but at least we have their stuff to enjoy. Speaking of which the track Sucker M.C.'s is calling my name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wanna get into hip hop, where do you suggest I start?
Oh man, that's an incredibly tough question. I'm not sure there is a best place to start, but I'll make a recommendation anyway.
Okay, where do you think I should start.
I think you should start with Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d. city. It's recent, sounds recent, the storytelling is great, the sequencing is great, the lyrics are great, and the songs are great.
Where does that fall in his discography?
It's his second official album out of a total of four.
Do you think it is his best?
I think it's his second best, but it's more accessible than To Pimp A Butterfly which is my favorite.
So you're saying I shouldn't start with his best album?
Exactly, I know it sounds counter intuitive, but you'll have a much deeper appreciation if you start with good kid, m.A.A.d. city.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know where Eminem grew up?
In Detroit, I think
Wasn't the movie 8 Mile about him?
Yes, it was
That was a good movie. I like his rap.
Do you have any of his albums?
Yes, all of them
Which one is your favorite?
I like Infinite.
That is one of his best for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think its possible for Jay Z to make a bad song?
I don't think I can recall any bad ones
His album with Linkin Park was so good
I've listened to that album too many times to remember
I was at his concert recently and it was so fun
Beyonce and him make a really good team in terms of music.
I think he is my favorite rapper
99 problems is a really good song
I think that song is when I started to listen.
I'm looking forward to his new stuff
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so you like rap, right?
Not really. What made you think I liked rap?
There's that one song you were playing. It was by the guy that does Filthy Frank, right?
I mean, I guess so. I like that, yeah, but most rap out there is just terrible.
What do you mean?
It's like... All rappers and hip hop artists seem to do is use cheap, simple beats and only talk about drugs or alcohol or something.
Yeah but there are artists out there that don't do that. Swimming Pools is basically criticizing that kind of culture.
Sure, yeah, that's true. But that song isn't the majority of rap and hip hop. Think about it. Who have been the biggest rappers recently?
Uh... Lil Wayne. 50 cent, but he's not as big now. Eminem puts meaning into his stuff.
Yeah, but then you have Beyonce and Rihanna and others like Wayne and cent that once in a while do something good, but then they mostly just play whatever people think they're supposed to be hearing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like eminem
Yes hes awesome to listen to
I agree
What songs do you like
I really like the song lose yourself
Thats a great song
What song do you like
Song for the moment
I forgot about that song
Its a good one
XXXXXXXXXXX
50 cent is a cool artist would you say
yeah he has a unique style
he got hot with that in the club song
yeah that song got listened to by millions
do you think he's better than nas?
no nas got alot of deep rap songs
so does fifty they both from new york.
yeah but nas been in the game longer
yeah he has but fifty more popular.
maybe so i think nas is more a laid back rapper
XXXXXXXXXXX
You by any chance a fan of a particular type of music?
Yeah. I'm a pretty hardcore rap fan.
Really? Who's your favorite?
Right now, or all-time?
How about both?
Right now, my favorite rapper is easily Kendrick Lamar.
And what about all-time?
That's got to be the Notorious BIG.
A bit of East and West. I like it.
Glad to hear it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when Ice Cube used to be popular?
I know him, wasn't he in the rap group "C.I.A"?
Yes he was actually.
He's pretty talented.
I know, he's in quite a few movies now too these days.
Wasn't he also in another rap group?
He was actually, "N.W.A".
I thought so. He didn't stay with them for long though.
No, his first movie he acted in was "Boyz n the Hood."
I've never seen that. I'm a fan though so I'll look it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Tupac?
Who could forget him?
Yeah I know just didn't know if it was before you time.
Tupac's music and ideas will live for a hundred years past his death.
Possibly, anyway I was just thinking about him today.
What about?
I remember him on tv always preaching how we need to be nice to eachother and stop killing one another.
Yeah that stuff was deep, do you think that's what got him killed?
I think it was because he was convincing the world that just because you're one thing doesn't mean you have to be this or that and to stop doing it.
Yeah he was deep and I loved him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the rap game will suffer once Eminem dies.
He hasnt really been doing much lately.
Yeah but he can still kill a guest appearance
I think they have already moved on
Future is the new supreme ruler
I like Childish Gambino
He is only doing one more album
He doesnt tour much either
He has other options
Yeah the acting part is crap though
XXXXXXXXXXX
You don't strike me as the type that listens to rap music.
Really, I'm a metalhead.
Oh, so I guess there's no point in talking about it, then.
I do actually listen to rap more than you might think.
Really? What do you like.
Eminem was always been my favorite.
Not bad. He's not the only one you listen to, is he?
Of course not. I listen to a lot of Tupac, Biggie, NWA, and Bone Thugs.
Oh, so you like 90s rap?
In my opinion, that's the best era of rap.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a fan of Proof?
I thought he kept D12 together
I thought the same thing
Lyrically he killed every song he was in
He was also Eminem's hype man on performaces
I think he influenced Em more than we will ever know
I dont know about that, Eminem had Dre
Yeah but Proof was there from the start before he met Dre
His lyrics were mostly mature
Yeah he still mixed it in with the D12 style.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Do you like rap?
Yeah it's okay.
Not a big fan?
No not really.
Do you have a favorite rap track?
I heard one by Childish Gambino on the radio the other day.
Redbone?
Yeah I think that's it.  I really like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rap music have you been listening to lately?
I have been hearing a lot of Stevie Stone.
I have never heard of him.
His Level Up album is quite decent.
What is your favorite song on it?
I like the song "Another Level".
Should I check it out?
Oh definitely, it has a great sound.
I will go ahead and buy the album if I like it.
Awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think makes a good rap song?
That's a complex question.
Do you think it's the flow or the beat?
I think they are both important.
Do you think the flow is more important?
I think it is important to the song, yes.
You think it's more important than the beat?
Maybe, you can have a good flow without a beat.
I would say the flow is more important than the beat.
I would agree with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man you know who I miss? Eminem.
Oh for sure, I feel like he'll go down as one of the greatest.
You know how people call themselves 'stans'? It comes from Eminem's song 'Stan,' about that crazy obsessed guy.
Woah, I didn't know that, I really like that song. Are you an Eminem stan?
I guess I could say that. You already know that classic line from 'Lose Yourself.'
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms is heavy --
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's Spaghetti.
Haha! Have you heard the song 'My Life' with Adam Levine and 50 Cent?
No, but that's a real weird trio.
Oh, well there's this line that goes - getting my tastebuds ready to wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-GET EVEN. Man Eminem likes spaghetti.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just could never get into hip hop because I couldn't get past the sound itself.
What do you mean?
Well it's like, not really music. It's a bunch of random sounds thrown together on a loop, I don't hear any skill in it.
I feel differently about that. I feel like that just allows for the skill they do have to be focused more on the lyrics, the construction of them and such.
Then why don't they drop the background noise altogether?
Well there is skill involved in creating a track besides just playing instruments, you know.
And where do they get all their samples anyway?
James Brown, The Temptations, others.. I like hearing black artists represented, you don't see enough of that these days.
I still don't think I could get into it.
Well you don't have to, but you're missing out man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to any Chicago rappers?
Yeah, have you heard of Rico Recklezz?
Yes, I love his music. Hes crazy.
For sure. I feel like he just keeps getting better and better.
I think so too. Have you heard the song No Talking by him?
Yeah I heard that like the first week it came out.
Do you like it?
Yeah, its crazy good. I listen to it on a weekly basis.
Haha, He is an amazing rapper compared to other Chicago rappers.
He's definitely top 5.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you like?
I like rap music
Me too
Do you have any favorites
Ludacris is one of my favorites
Oh he is good
What about you
I really like ja rule
He is good to
I know
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is you favorite rap artist.
i love ice cube
who's your favorite i like ice cube a lot
oh he's good to i forgot about him
did 2pac every get a grammy?
yeah i think so 1 are two
i like salt and peeper also do you.
no they where not on my like list
oh okay there kind of ole school.
that's cool i haven't heard them in a while
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the most underrated album by a rapper?
It would have to be 808s & Heartbreak by Kanye West.
Oh, right? People are always talking trash on that one, but it's probably my favorite one of his.
Well, my favorite Kanye album is still College Dropout, but Heartbreak is still excellent.
Remember when Through the Wire came out?
Yes! I had MTV on, and I was just cleaning house. That song came on, and I swear I'd never heard it before in my life. I just stopped what I was doing and watched the whole thing.
Yeah, it was really different from anything out at the time. Kanye kind of took over after that.
He did. It's too bad he ends up saying so much outlandish stuff on TV now.
I feel really bad for him. He can't enjoy the negativity that comes from all that.
No, but maybe it gives him more stuff to write about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite living New York rapper?
I would have to say Jay-Z.
Yeah i followed him his entire career, he definitely changed the game.
Who is your favorite New York artist?
I'm a big fan of Jay-Z as well but i also like Jadakiss as well.
Jadakiss can always br counted on to bring some fire to a track.
Yeah it doesn't matter who he raps with, he is usually the stand out artist on a song.
How do you feel about Nas?
I think he is a talented artist, i just wish he was more consistent.
That is so true but you can't take away from the fact the illmatic is one of the best rap albums ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you miss Definitive Jux?
Yeah, I definitely do. They put out some great music.
It's crazy to think that they were putting out their stuff at the same time as all the bling rappers.
I know. That was a very odd period in hip-hop.
What's your favorite Def Jux release?
I would probably go with The Cold Vein by Cannibal Ox.
Oh man, that's a classic album. The production is crazy.
Yeah, for sure. What's your favorite?
I like El-P's Fantastic Damage. The production on that is even crazier.
Isn't it wild how big he's gotten? Who would have imagined that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
This hip hop stuff is different
How is it different
it is more mellow than the rap i usually listen to
Well it is not the same as west coast rap
I mean it is more nuanced and has a different type of  beat
That is the point of it
I like how rap and hip hop have different genres
I know the musics diverse
Diverse as can be man
For sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of hip hop?
I am but I don't like the new stuff they're playing on the radio.
It's terrible in my opinion. I think it stopped being good in the early 2000's.
That is definitely when it started going downhill. I do like Kendrick Lamar though.
Right he is one of the few exceptions of good hip hop artists today.
Also the old school artists who are still going strong like Nas. They give hip hop hope.
I love Nas. I heard he's with Nicky Minaj now.
Really? Well that's not really a surprise, he was with Kelis who doesn't seem like she's a fit with him.
it's just that he's a conscious rapper so you'd think he'd be more selective about who he's with.
Well I heard she's a really nice person so that might have something to do with it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Nicki Minaj?
I honestly think she's great. Her lyrics are very well thought out.
People tend to either love her or hate her.
I think a lot of people are jealous. She's showing the world she's just as good as anyone else.
True. Numbers don't lie.
You always see her with a hit single out. Consistency like that isn't easy.
Yeah, you have to respect that.
The beat that they used in "Anaconda" was genius.
Is that the one with the recycled "Baby Got Back" samples?
Yeah, that song is very creative and so is her performance of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of female rappers?
I'm a fan! I think that women can rap just as well as men
Do you have a favorite female rapper?
Iggy Azalea is my favorite.
Interesting. I don't know a lot of her music.
You should check out the song "Work." It has a great message.
What is it about?
The lyrics are about trying your best and not stopping until you reach your goal.
It sounds like a very motivational song.
It is! I like to listen to it when I work out sometimes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how did you first start listening to rap?
Well I just knew that I wanted to because my family had never exposed me to it, so I thought I'd start with Tupac as a safe bet since evryone seemed to like him.
Makes sense. So that made you want to listen to more.
Exactly.
Do you still listen to him?
Yeah, partly because of the good memories of that being my first exposure to hip hop, partly because it was a time frame where life was relatively happy.
But you like something about him specifically, otherwise you wouldn't have delved into more of it, right?
I mean his voice doesn't do anything for me...
Man, I love his distinctive voice!
Yeah, strictly sound wise his music doesn't do a whole lot for me either.. just constructually, the way his lyrics are formatted and story-wise that's what got me, being able to follow a linear story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to any Lil Wayne music?
I listened to some of his music.
Me too. Which song did you like the best?
I really enjoyed his song "How to Love".
I remember that one. Such a great song.
One of my ultimate faves was "Go DJ".
Yes that was a great one too. I really loved the beat of that song.
I completely agree. One of a kind for sure.
Yes it was!
"Mrs. Officer" was pretty great too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Nicki Minaj?
My favorite is Anaconda.
She had a boy toy named Troy.
And he lived in Detroit.
He was keeping her stylish.
And that was real, real real.
They they had bananas on the record player.
And girls all up on each other.
And she was dressed to kill.
And they were pushing up daises.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the guy that had the Baby Got Back song?
Sir Mixalot?
Yeah, I couldn't remember his name!  Did he have any other songs?
I remember a couple, but I don't know if it's because my cousins would play his tape nonstop.
What other songs do you remember?
Posse on Broadway was probably the biggest one.
I think I kind of remember that one.  What were the other ones?
I remember Put Em on the Glass and Buttermilk Biscuits.
Seriously?  There's a song called Buttermilk Biscuits?
Yes, and it sounded awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is one of the most underrated MCs of all time?
Jeru The Damaja.
Who's Jeru the Damaja?
He's a New York rapper known for his albums The Sun Rises in the East and Wrath of the Math.
So which one should I listen to first.
Either will do, I prefer The Sun Rises in the East.
What is his style?
If you're familiar with and enjoy early 90s New York hip hop, you'll really like this. Think Nas.
Ah, that sounds so great. Nas is one of my favorites.
Same. Jeru the Damaja also has DJ Premier as a producer, who is just the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you consider the greatest rap group
The Roots
I say they arent really rap
OK how about Wu Tang
Yeah I could argue that too
They were an awesome collaborative
They were making great music
Some of them have died
I thought just ODB?
One more I believe
XXXXXXXXXXX
Eminem is my favorite rapper of all time. Who is your favorite rapper?
I love Eminem but my favorite would have to be Snoop Dogg.
What's your favorite Snoop song?
Gin and juice.
Have you seen his new music video?
No, What is it called?
It is called Moment I Feared and it is really good.
I'll have to check it out.
Some say he is dissing new rappers in the song.
I'll take a listen and let you know what I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Method Man?
Yes
Do you like Redman?
Yes
Do you think they are a good team?
Yes
Who do you think is better?
They are equally awesome
Would you like to see them live?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite artist on the G.O.O.D. Music imprint?
Aside from Kanye, who is of course the best?
Yeah, aside from Kanye West.
My favorite has to be Pusha T. That dude has such evocative lyrics and a great cadence.
Yeah, he really makes you feel his words.
I know. I've been following him since back during his time with Clipse.
Same, I remember being young and seeing the video for Grindn with Pharrell and being hooked.
Yeah, it was a mindblowing experience for me. Loved the aesthetic of that video with all the guys on the bike.
And the beat was so spare, but worked so well.
I know, imagine trying to come up with a rap to put over that though? That takes a ton of talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, anyone rap artist I kind of like is Wyclef Jean.
Oh, what songs do you like?
Well, I really like "Perfect Gentleman" because of the way it blends the symphony with his rap lyrics is a really neat combination.
Not sure I've heard that song.
Yeah, it's the one that goes, "Just cause she dances, mo fo, don't make her a ho, no."
Dunno.. maybe I'd recognize it if I heard it.
Maybe.  Another interesting song he did was a duet with Kenny Rodgers.  They did a remake of the "The Gambler."
Say what??  The Kenny Rogers?
Yes, the country star!  They have him doing the original lyrics and Wyclef raping along with it.
Wow, that just seems rather bizarre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your favorite album from this year?
I liked Kendrick's new album "DAMN".
Cool what's your favorite song from that album?
I think it's Pride.
I liked that one too but I think my favorite may be Energy.
Overall what's your favorite song from him?
A.D.H.D. from section 80. What about yours?
Money trees!
That song is also amazing, I think he may be the greatest rapper ever.
I definitely agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your rap guilty pleasures?
I have so many, I identify primarily as a conscious rap fan, which is nothing to be guilty about. However, I really like Soulja Boy and Chief Keef.
Ha! Those young dudes, I guess Soulja Boy isn't that young anymore, make fun music.
Yes, it's fun. The lyrics aren't deep, but the confidence, the cadence, the beat are all there.
It's also really nice to see these kids who grew up in poverty make some cash.
Right, I can't hate on it. They're doing good for themselves and their family.
Except Bobby Shmurda.
Right, Shmurda didn't take peoples advice about getting away from crime seriously and now he's in jail.
I'd hate to see the same thing happen to Kodak Black.
It could happen, but I really hope it doesn't. He's a prodigious talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like the best in rap?
I like Eminem.
How come?
He knows how to move people.
He is genius in his inspiration.
I like the words to his songs.
They do have lots of feeling and expression.
What's your favorite Eminem song?
I like them all, but I have to say rap god.
That is a good one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like dipset in the early 2000s?
I think they were great, that was the time of hiphop groups.
Yes, that is when dblock, gunit, and dipset was the best out.
Those were the days of pure hip hop.
Right now unfortunately we do not have any hip-hop groups that I can think of.
True, we have individual rappers on the same label that is about it.
I really liked the nice beats that dipset had.
I did too, they were some of the best instrumentals of all time.
I think that DJ's name was Kanye West, he made a lot of good beats
Kanye West has been great for a long time I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like Hip Hop?
Sure.  I'm not a huge fan but I'll listen to it.
Who is your favorite rapper?
I would have to go back to the 90's.  I always liked Biggie.
That's a great choice.
What about you?
I like Kendrick Lamar a lot.
Sure, he's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about Funkmaster Flex?
he is alright but biggie was way better.
do you like Tupac or diddy better?
i like tupac better for sure.
have you heard the games new song?
yeah it is super lit
what year did tupac die?
i think 1995 or 1996 im not sure.
do you like 50 cents music?
yeah i do that in da club song was dope
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really miss 90s rap. The music today just doesn't reach me.
I know what you mean. That was my favorite era of music.
Who do you think was the best rapper of that era?
Actually, I liked the groups, like Outkast and the Wu-Tang Clan.
Hmm, those are two very different groups! Do you like any solo artists?
I think the rappers out of New York are the best. I really like Nas.
His music has such distinctive beats. Grimy, but somehow clear.
"If I Ruled the World" is a really touching song.
Do you like Jay-Z?
Yes, but not as much as Nas and the Wu-Tang Clan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really happy to see more foreign hip hop available streaming nowdays.
Yeah, it's still pretty slim pickins though.
There definitely should be more but I feel it's an improvement.
And often times there's no info given on the artists.
Exactly, so you can't find out more about them and support them if you wanted to.
Yeah. I was looking for Polish rap the other week and only 3 or so decent songs came up.
That's a shame.
There has to be more of an active rap scene in places like Poland than are being represented.
I've had more success following established artists on social media and then looking up who they advertise than I do searching on my own.
I may have to try that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rap artist right now?
I would say Jay-Z. I think he is amazing.
I do love his music. I wish he made more of it though.
I heard he has a new album coming out this month.
Really? That would be fantastic.
I know! His raps are so genuine and easy to relate with.
I agree. I also really like his rap style. He keeps it somewhat slow.
He does. He definitely has his own flavor to his raps. You always can tell it is him when you hear it.
I really like that about his raps. He stays true to himself.
I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Man did you see that new Tupac Movie yet?
No I sure didn't hopefully its as good as his music was
I know, shame that he had to die so young
Seems like most rappers that have talent pass away young
Yup Biggie Smalls and Tupac and Eazy E
Then again we still have some great rappers left like Jay Z and Dr DRE and Ice Cube
Ice Cube isn't he an actor
He started out as a rapper in a group called NWA with Dr DRE, you should check out the movie Straight outta compton
I saw the trailer for that one it looked promising
Yeah its an excellent movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like mumble rap?
why would i like that?
they are unique. hip hop is at its punk phase
Its not like punk.
its opening the doors and doing new things.
its not speaking on anything important though.
its more about having fun i suppose.
its not very political.its just stupid
well, its good music to bump to in the case.
maybe
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ain't nothin' but a G thang baby.........
What are you doing? You quoting Dr. Dre?
Actually, I am quoting Snoop Dogg or Snoop Lion or whatever he calls himself today.
Why'd he change his name anyway? Snoop Dogg sounds so much better than Snoop Lion.
Beats me. All I know is The Chronic album was the bomb.
You darn right. It was definitely my favorite rap album back in the day.
And the videos were so raunchy. I don't think MTV would play them anymore.
Does MTV still play music videos? I honestly do not know.
Was the dude that played Eazy E in the Snoop and Dre videos the same little dude that was in Ice Cube's Friday movie?
That's a really good question. I don't know but they do look just alike.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite song by Snoop Dogg?
I would have to say Drop it like its hot.
Yeah, that's my favorite too.
He was really on the grind back then with that song.
He had a good flow i think Pharrel was on the track as well.
Yeah he was. That is what made it vibe so well.
Yeah i agree.
Do you like any other of his songs.
Yes I do.
What are they?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you rather listen to hip hop or rnb?
I like hip hop more.
Why do you like hip hop more?
I like it because I can relate more to hip hop artist.
I can understand because I favor hip hop as well.
I really like how they just tell their life story in their raps.
It is a thing of beauty and I respect their craft.
I'm with you, it is a special thing to witness.
I wish people tell the truth more in raps instead of fabricating stories.
True, but you know there are always frauds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into rap?
Oh yes definitely.
What artists do you like?
I love lil' kim.
What albums of hers do you like?
I love the Notorious K.I.M.
Oh is that the album with some mary j. blige collaborations?
Yes.
I will have to take a listen.
Listen to all of them they are amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is you  favorite mid  90s  rap  act ?
I really liked  do  or  die  .
They  did  do  you want  to  ride   as a  track  right ?
And I  really like  the party feel of  that   track .
Did  they  do  anything  else  natable  ?
Not  really  they worked with some  younger    groups like  lyfe  and  black  star.
So  the  mentored  alot  of younger  rappers .
Yeah  the  game  did not  treat  them real  well.
Well  maybe  they will go on  tour  again  one   day
We can  hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest rapper?
I think it's Eminem.
You don't think it's Tupac, Biggie or Jay-Z?
I think they are all good, but I think Eminem is better.
I think Biggie is overrated.
I think he was pretty good but I think Tupac was better.
Tupac actually had a deeper writing style.
Yeah, but he still rapped about weed and girls.
I just realized Eminem doesn't rap alot about girls and weed.
That's why I think he's the greatest of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Ludacris at all?
He had the dirty south type of rap delivery
Yeah I wasnt all about it
Southern Hospitality had its redeeming qualities.
I didnt think it was that good.
Yah I can see where you would think it was too commercialized.
That and it rang about like it was careless.
How so?
The lyrics were isolated and fine, but meshed they sounded terrible.
Thats an interesting take that I havent heard about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am not really fond of rap music.
Really? Why's that?
I think the rhymes are incredibly stupid, and the artists really mumble.
I guess you are right.  Is there anybody you like that raps.
I don't know any of their names.  Usually, I am just telling my son to choose something different on the radio.
Have you heard of Nicki Minaj?
I have, and I actually like her.  She has some talent.
I like her too.  She can rap and sing.
Have you heard her sing with Drake and Lil Wayne?
I don't know if I have, but I will look them up together and listen.  Nicki makes rap bearable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best lyricist in hip-hop?
I would say Nas.  Maybe with Andre 3000 coming in at a close second.
Nas's first album, "Illmatic" is definitely a classic.  His second album, "It Was Written", was a good album too.
He was a young guy when he recorded those album.
Yep.  One of my favorite songs from "It Was Written" was a song called "The Message".
Is that the song that samples Sting's "Shape of My Heart"?
That is the one.
I love that song.  I get nostalgic when I listen to songs from that era.
Me too.  It remind of the good hip-hop that was coming out from New York City in the 90s.
There doesn't seem to be a lot of new talent coming out from New York these days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Kanye West a lot?
I really can't stand him.
Don't you think that he is talented?
He definately is talented, but he wastes a lot of his talent on being arrogent and annoying.  That does appeal to some though.
He's just rapping about what he is passionate about.
Well, I could understand if it was that, but his music is too much in the background.
What do you mean?
Make your message sound good.  Don't just have a message and say it over and over with no musical integrity.
I guess you have your opinion.
That's how I feel when I hear him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was The Chronic as big as people make it sound?
I think it was.
Dre produced it right?
I dont know if he produced it but obviously it was his album
I thought that it touched on alot of the rap that is most important nowadays.
He rapped about pot a whole lot.
Well that was the basis for most of his songs.
He did a follow up to it as well.
Yeah I think it was boring
He waited too long plus I dont think hes that great of a rapper anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any of Kanye West's music?
I used to. Some of his songs were pretty good.
One of my most favorite songs of his was "Gold Digger".
Right! I loved that one.
His song "Heartless" was pretty good too.
I remember that one also. It had a great beat to it.
Yes it did. I'm not a huge fan now though.
I'm not really either.
I think he's slightly overrated.
I agree. He's too full of himself these days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Drake?
He's ok. But he's not my favorite rapper.
Who is your favorite rapper?
I really love Lil Wayne!
Why do you like him so much.
He is from my hometown. We both grew up in the same place!
What town is that?
New Orleans!
I had no idea Lil Wayne was from New Orleans.
Yup! I'm really proud to be from the same place as him
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Kendrick Lamar could beat Eminem in a rap battle?
Kendrick is very good, but I don't think anyone is going to beat Eminem.
I actually feel like their styles are similar, but different in a way.
Yeah, but Eminem is a battle rapper. Kendrick would be scared.
True, I doubt he would even accept the offer.
I don't know if anyone would.
No rapper ever says anything bad about Eminem. He's like untouchable.
They know he could end any of their careers.
Still, I think Kendrick would put up the best fight.
That I can agree with. It would be interesting, for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is you're favorite artist right now ?
I think I would have to go with Eminem.What about you ?
Mine would probably be Drake.
Yea he has some nice songs with cool flows.
Same with Eminem he is a pretty unique rapper.
What is you're favorite Eminem song ?
Mine is Not Afraid, it's such a meaningful song I just love it.
Yep, that's also one of my favorites.
What about you're favorite Drake song ?
Mine would have to be Energy, it has such a powerful melody with it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite era of hip-hop.
90's for sure!
I'm going to have to agree with you there. It had some of the best rappers.
True. Who was your favorite rapper from the 90's?
Snoop Dogg.
He's in my top five. I would say my favorite is Digable Planets.
Who is that?
Well they're a group.
I have to give them a listen.
You won't regret it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't like tap that much.
That's ok a lot of people prefer other types of music.
I don't relate to rap music that much.
I think that makes sense. You grew up in Indiana.
Yeah I just don't understand it. It seems vulgar.
Some of it is. It's hard to generalize.
And they use so many bad words.
I think it helps them express their emotions.
I can understand. I do use some bad words.
It's just a different style of music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
As hard as I try, I just can't get into rap music.
Really? There are so many awesome rappers out there like Nas, Andre 30 and Dr. Dre.
One of the biggest issues for me is that so many raps songs have profanity.
That's because the lyrics are telling a story.
I get that, but I don't think they need to swear.
Is that the only thing that bothers you about rap music?
I also found that the music isn't good  A  lot of the time and they'll take the same few notes and play them over and over again.
Rapping isn't so much about the music, but about the actual rapping.
But without good music, I'm not entertained.
OK. I understand why you don't like rap now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i think eminem is a good rap person
Well he is good
Yeah i like him compared to most
I mean he has a song called rap god
Now i would not call him god
He might be though
Nah no way
Why not
Noone can be
You never know bro
XXXXXXXXXXX
So , who do you think is one of the best rappers out?
Not sure. What about you?
I would say T.I.
Uh, T. I no , I would have to say Chance the rapper.
Oh yeah. He is pretty hot right now.
And what about Kendrick his album was great this year.
Yes it was I listneed to that for days.
There are so many that are hot , hasn't been this hot in a long time.
That is correct. Lil Wayne?
Oh yeah he is the greatest of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Grime will ever be a big subgenre in America?
I'm not too sure. Drake did it justice in exposing it on More Life, but I don't think it resonated with fans.
I agree. I'm not sure if Americans have that acquired yearning for rap with deep British accents.
Not just that, but it's a grittier type of music too.
Definitely. Regardless, rappers like Stormzy and Skepta are killing it with their delivery and flows.
I can definitely agree, Konichiwa was so underrated.
All of the guys on Boy Better Know have very diverse yet hard bars.
Exactly, and their sounds are all so different and fresh.
Sometimes I wish American rappers would step out of the box like British Grime artists do.
Yep, but for now, we have to deal with the copy cat flows.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i love rap so much it's a cool way to past time
yeah there plenty good one's out there to listen to.
who's some of your best rap groups?
i like some of the early 2000's
like who i like zro he's from houston.
yeah i heard of him, i like scareface, he's also from  houston
yeah they got so many rappers know days it's hard to choose
i stick a few that i like
yeah me to ocasionaly i'll hear some new stuff i like
yeah i'm okay with the new, long as it's a style i haven't heard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Faith Evans is touring again?
Wow. I can't believe she's still preforming.
I know, I always liked her. It was so sad when Biggie died.
You could tell that she was truly heart broken.
Her new album is all duets that her and Biggie did.
Oh wow, that's so cool. What is it called?
The album is called Legacy. She sings about what their life was and what it could have been.
I really need to listen to that, that sounds really cool.
You can also watch videos of her on YouTube explaining each track and what happened.
I'm going to look that up right now. Thanks for telling me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
what genre in music do you think is most popular among young adults?
oh, it's no doubt gonna be hip hop, I heard them quite often in college
what characteristics hip hop music often consist of?
well, usually there are multiple or just one cool black dude, singining in punch line about some sensitive stuff in societies
wouldn't that be too sensitive then?
no, they actually made it sound very fun and chill, and I think it helps relax atmosphere in a social environment quite a bit
that sounds very psychologically satisfiying
it's indeed, but be warmed they are usually explicit
Oh, I'll make sure I won't play it when my parents are here
wise choice
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Jay z is over rated
It depends what he is rated on are we taking about the greatest of all time or one of the greatest of all time?
The greatest of all time.
Then yes in that part he is over rated if we just talking baout rap then yes he is one of the greatest . but the greatest no.
Why do you thik people overrate him?
I think people get the business side of what he did with the record label with he actually rap legacy
Business side?
Yes how he started the label with nothng and made it as big as it is
So who do you think the greatest rapper of all time is
Tupac hands down bro
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rap artist have you been listening to lately?
Azealia Banks.
Oh really? I haven't heard much of her music.
It is amazing. It is rap but it has elements of house and garage.
Sounds interesting. What songs should I listen to?
1991, and the big beat.
I will definitely take a listen.
Liquorice is very good too for her song.
She should be on the radio more often.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of rap music?
I used to be, but I don't really like many of the rappers of today.
Who is your current favorite rapper.
I would have to say Eminem, but he doesn't seem to come out with as much stuff as he used to.
How about the past? Who is your favorite rapper of all time?
I would have to say Tupac. He rarely made a song I didn't like.
I can't believe he died, but it did seem like they released a lot of music from him even after he died.
Some people think that he isn't dead and lives in South America.
That seems a little ridiculous to me. It's a shame that the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac died too young.
They were definitely two of the best rappers of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whatever happened to DJs in hip-hop? The ones who scratched records and all that.
I'm not sure. I think people still scratch records.
I mean the ones who could rock the party, like Grandmaster Flash.
Oh man, he was really great. Even then, I think people mostly remember "The Message", which was more lyrics-oriented.
I loved "The Adventures on the Wheels of Steel".
I think it's hard to replicate what the DJ does in an airplay-friendly manner.
Except for mix shows. Man, I loved those growing up.
Me too. They always had crazy remixes and exclusives.
It used to be that every group had a DJ.
Now, rap doesn't even have groups. Long live the old school.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man Lil wayne is such a bad rapper
I know right
He gives modern rap a bad label
Yeah it is like he is a big joke
Pretty much he is the joke though
Yeah i cannot stand his voice
And he cannot even use his unaltered voice
I know even those who use autotune can do it
But not him right
Yep exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper?
Surprising to many, it's Kanye West.
Okay, I could see that. Like, his old stuff is amazing.
Exactly. All Falls Down is my favorite song.
Yeah, it's an amazing track. So I get it.
Who is your favorite rapper.
Queen Latifah. She's old school, but so good.
I hear that.U.N.I.T.Y. is an amazing track.
Yeah, I love the messages of her work.
Me too. She's truly an inspiration.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of your favorite vintage rap songs?
U Can't Touch This by M C Hammer.
I love that song and he wore some crazy pants in his video.
I also really like Run DMC's Walk This Way.
The original was good, but I like when they remade it with Steve Tyler from Aerosmith.
That was a really good version, too, although I liked the original better.
What About the Humpty Dance?
Who was it by?
Digital Underground.
I don't recall that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which 90s rapper is your favorite?
That's a tough one. Probably Eazy E.
What do you think about Ice Cube?
He has a good legacy, but seems more commercial nowadays.
Yeah, he has toned down quite a bit since his early days.
I think that Snoop Dogg has stayed relevant.
Yeah, his music videos are still interesting.
I think Jay Z has endured.
Well, he's certainly wealthy!
No argument there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Drake album?
Nothin was the Same is my personal favorite.
Did you like the sounds he used?
I think there was enough experimentation for the track to flow well.
Yeah I agree and lyrically he was on top of his game.
It was an all around robust sound.
I loved Tuscan Leather.
Is that what started the album off?
Yeah and it got your jusices flowing.
He can spit better than almost 90% of rappers out there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Rick Ross?
Yes I do like him.
What's your favorite song?
Probably Everyday i'm hustling.
That's the first song I ever heard of his.
Really, it's a good one.
Does his appearance put you off though?
No not really he's just a big guy.
Yeah he looks like a big teddy bear.
Yes he does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So gotta know something
What you needing to know
Well what is your favorite west coast rap song
Well thats an easy one
Yeah?
Its easily Gin and Juice
Snoop?
Yeah classic snoop is awesome
I mean all is though
Heck yea man
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite rap artist?
I don't have one particular, Actually I have multiple.
Oh, But there must be one you like more, right?
Umm, Let me guess, I guess it is eminem.
Oh yes, Eminem is good.
Yup, few good white rappers out there.
I agree.
But I also like ice cube a lot.
Ice cube?
Yes, haven't you heard of him?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Macklemore?
I think he is extremely talented.  He's a good rapper.
Does it bother you that he raps about controversial issues?
Why should it?  Some other rappers rap about drugs and sex.
Yeah, that makes sense.  He's just saying what he feels.
Yeah, and besides, he is more positive.  He does have some tongue in cheek funny songs though.
Yeah, I really like Downtown.
Downtown was more radio friendly.  He has dirtier songs.
Oh, I didn't reallize that.  I might have to look into it.
Yeah, I think you'd like him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What era of Rap do you like best?
You can't even compare rap today with the 90's.
I know what you mean.  Today you have Little Wayne, drake, etc.
They can't even wipe the shoes of the Wu Tang, Dre, Beastie Boys, Nas, etc
What about the Fugees album?
That was one of the best hip hop albums of all time.
What about the Chronic by Dre.  That might actually be the best rap album of all time.
Everyone song on that Album was great.
Don't forget the Notorious BIG
He was amazing.  The song Warning is one of the best of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't really understand whether there's a difference between rap and hip-hop. The language confuses me.
That's cool, a lot of people use them pretty interchangeably. But I was watching this awesome old film Wild Style that really showed how rap is an element of hip hop culture overall.
What do you mean "an element"?
Well, hip hop is like the overall multi-media art form. It typically has four elements, it's just that we don't talk about some of them as much.
So what are these four elements?
Rap (the words), Dj-ing (scratching, turntables), dance, and graffiti
Oh, so rap is more the...verbal element?
Yeah! I just think it's really interesting how we never really talk that much about graffiti or the visual style anymore.
Yeah, I have no idea about any of that. I've seen some hip-hop influenced dance, though.
Yeah, but even that makes it sound like it came later, as opposed to being an integral part all along.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to rap?
Yeah. I really like '90s stuff, though. You?
Oh, yeah. Definitely. I love Busta Rhymes.
Oh, for sure.
Who do you like?
I like a lot of the females from back in the day, like Lil Kim and Missy.
That's cool. Missy is so classic.
Yeah, "The Rain" and "Hot Boyz" are some of my favorites.
Of course, you can't forget about Timbaland and Magoo.
You know that's right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite rapper?
i like rich homie quan.
i like rich homie quan too.
what do you like about him?
i think he has really good flow.
he is really smooth with his lyrics.
his beats are really catchy too.

i like that some type of way song.
i like the song he did with tip.
XXXXXXXXXXX

yeah he better stick to movies.

yeah that shit was wack he on some other shit.
who you think best rapper out of Compton?
that has to be kendrick lamar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seed RIGHT BY MY SIDE by Nicki?
A good song by Minaj.
I like how Chris Brown sings.
That's romantic when she gets the coin.
And tosses it into the fountain.
Then they hug.
They are in love.
He gives her a car.
She is so happy.
They are happy together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to the new Kendrick Lamar album?
Yea, I thought it was decent.
Decent? It was literary genius.
Really? What track was your favorite?
I liked Humble.
Really? I feel like they've already played it out.
OOO can't play it too much!  It's relevant to his lifestyle?
How so ? All those rapper are the same, nobody is humble anymore?
Not true. Did you hear he bought his sister a corolla for graduation?
A corolla!  He really is humble.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen ANACONDA?
It is by NICKI MINAJ.
I like the gold necklace she wears.
The jungle was cool.
All those jungle sounds were cool.
She is kind of like a queen.
Yeah, she has those other girls around her.
And she is up on that platform.
Then it is all butts.
It is full of big butts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite A Tribe Called Quest song?
It's gotta be "Get a Hold" off of Beats, Rhymes and Life.
That's a really great song. The beat is crazy.
Yeah, that's a J Dilla beat, and do you know the sample?
Nah, what is it?
The sample is taken from a song called "The Visit" by a band named The Cyrkle.
That's interesting. How did you find out about that?
I saw Benji B talking about it in a YouTube video.
It's interesting to learn where hip-hop samples come from.
Yeah, I've always enjoyed tracking that stuff down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Eminem more than Easy E?
Yes, I think he has some better songs.
I disagree. I think Easy E has the best.
He does have dome good ones. But, Eminem has greater hits.
Yeah, you might be right. They are both great though.
Yeah. Easy E was a great rapper.
Do you like Snoop Dog?
Yes, he is very good.
I like all of his stuff.
His early stuff was excellent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You got any suggestions for new underground rappers for me to check out?
Rarri is a new rapper that I like.
Which songs should I listen to?
I liked "What Dey Seem", and  "2OUTH2ID3".
Alright cool. Who else do you suggest?
Warhol.ss, his song "Speed Racer" is great, the video is amazing too.
I know Warhol, but i haven't listened to a lot of his stuff.
Yeah, he did a song with Famous Dex not too long ago.
Alright cool, I'll check these guys out.
Nice, let me know what you think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about happy rap
I love happy rap and Will Smith is a good rapper.
Yes he never cuss in any raps.
I loved the fresh prince theme song.
Yes and parents just dont understand was a good one.
Summertime was jamming back in 1995.
Yes will smith did a good job with good music and no cussing.
Just the 2 of us was a good song too.
Will Smith did a good job with no cussing songs that was for the whole family.
He is such a good rapper.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite kendrick album?
to be honest, i do not know
I like to pimp a butterfly the best
that one has an amazing story but it doesnt have replay value
reallY? what about kunta?
that song is good but alright gets boring.
what do you think your favorite is then?
probably damn.
that album has a lot of replay value
especially dna
XXXXXXXXXXX
i think no limit had the greatest run in rap history
im more on the side of cash money
cash money was good but nobody came close to no limit
and no limit was good but cash money is still running
true but nobody sold an album every week that went gold or platinum
cash money still selling gold or platinum
they definitely had one of the best rosters ever
yeah they did have a nice roster
i wish we could have got collabs from both labels
i know i would love to see an abulm with them together
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rappers from any particular area?
I really like west coast guys and guys from the south.
That's cool, who are some of your favorites?
Guys like The Game and Lil Wayne.
Nice, I'm a big Lil Wayne fan as well.
Do you like his new or old stuff?
Mostly his older stuff like the songs off the carter 2.
There are so many classics on that album.
I also really like some of his collaborations with guys like eminem and young jeezy.
I'm with you, he does a great job on almost everything he does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you say are some of the earliest "legends" and "forefathers" of rap?
I think definitely artists like Dr Dre, Ice T, Flava Flav, and Run DMC.
I can tell you are young, because even though these are all great, I was talking about artists even before their time. Pioneers
I may be young, but I know rap music. If you're talking about real pioneers, I'd have to say Grandmaster Flash and Jazzy Jay.
I'm impressed!
I'm not done yet. I didn't get a chance to mention the Sugarhill Gang. Their classic song in the late 70's "Rapper's Delight" really showed the growth of the genre and introduction of scratching.
As a DJ, that song as well as "The Breaks" by Kurtis Blow really introduced that to me and changed the way I DJ'd
Rakim is another one of my favorite legends.
As a female DJ, I have to say one of my favorites was Sha Rock. I think she was one of the earliest female MCs in the game.
She might have been the actual first one to be that popular at least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
IT WAS A SHAME THAT BIGGIE WAS SHOT.
TUPAC WAS KILLED TOO.
THEY WERE MURDERED AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR CAREER
THAT EAST SIDE WEST SIDE NONSENSE WAS BOGUS
I WONDER WHAT TUPAC AND BIGGIE WOULD BE DOING TODAY IF THEY  WERE ALIVE
I LIKED "CALIFORNIA LOVE"
I LIKED " HYPNOTIZE"
THEY DIED ABOUT 21 YEARS AGO
THEY WERE PART OF MY CHILDHOOD
WHAT I LIKED IS MY DAD HATED THEIR MUSIC
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is the best rap album of all time
I think it's dr dre's the chronic
thats a pretty good choice
what about you, what would your choice be
I think dre's the chronic is pretty good, but I'm going to go with straight outta compton
really? that's a little bit old at this point
its old, but its the one that really got the whole rap scene going
that's a bold statement
you had ICE cube, Dr. Dre and Eazy E all busting rhymes on the same ablum!
very true. you could also hear all of them on the D.O.C.'s album too though
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you ever been into rap or hip hop?
A bit.  I really liked mid-2000s era, with 50 Cent's first album, Ludacris and the Bit Tymers from that era.
Yeah that was a good party era.  How about the hardcore rap of the '90s.
I didn't get too into that, but I remember it.  I specifically remember that was when MC Hammer fell from grace.
Yeah, that was too bad.  He didn't keep up with the times and his "party-pop" style went out of style.
Yeah I watched the VH1 movie about his life and it was interesting.  I remember saying "I'm hyped!" like he said when he was getting ready to record a song.
Yeah I saw that one too.  It was the part when he was on Death Row Records and he was trying to get relevant again.
Haha, those scenes with him and Tupac Shakur were funny!  He said, "Let's get you up and all perky" and Tupac said , "You're gonna get yourself shot!"
Yeah classic.  Fun stuff indeed.
Did you see the movie Straight Outta Compton?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is there a rapper that everyone likes that you just don't get.
Yup, his name is Jermaine Cole. J. Cole.
You don't like J. Cole? Really?
Nope, I think it's a shame he gets lumped in with Kendrick and some of the other current greats. I think he's making okay music that people think is "deep."
That's harsh! Have you listened to J. Cole's 2014 Forest Hills Drive?
Yup, I like a handful of songs, like G.O.M.D., but I'd be fine if I never heard him again. What rapper do you think is overhyped?
I don't really get Future.
I understand that. He's vulgar and his music is very unique sounding.
Yeah, his style just doesn't do it for me. All of his songs sound kind of similar to me, but people love him.
Yes, fans, critics and rappers themselves love Future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you can only choose one hip-hop artist to listen to ,who is it gonna be?
it's gotta be Lil Uzi Vert
may I ask why?
well, simply speaking, his songs got good vibe, good company when I'm doing work
I'm not surprised, he got quite few songs on the top list of billboards
yea, what song you like from him?
I can't remember, but I'm listening to XO TOUR LIFT3 recently from him
oh, that's a very chill music, afternoon vibe
now that you mentioned it, I indeed feel it's an afternoon vibe, lazy and energetic at the same time
yes indeed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite type of music?
definitely hip hop, they're awesome!
cool, I like them too, who's your faovirte artist then?
in hip hop?
yea
I think I quite like Kyle, his songs are chill and funny
such as?
such as a song named iSpy, it has funny lines about girls and their little lies
haha, that sounds fun
yeah, you should check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to a lot of rap music?
I do on occasion. I like some of it.
Which artist do you like the best?
I really like Blackstreet from back in the 90's.
You mean they sing that one song "No Diggity" right?
Yes! That was really popular back then.
You're right I used to sing that all the time.
Me too! I enjoyed their music.
Do you know any more of their music?
Not really, "No Diggity" is the only one I can think of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Snoop ever release another album?
Doubt it why does he need to
To show he can still rap
He has alot of other business ventures.
Are any of them worth talking about
Like on an album?
No just in general, like Jay Z had production companies and a streaming service.
I dont know what you could say really.
he does do guest spots on albums
Yeah but thats not nearly the same
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to see Straight Outta Compton?
No, I didn't how was it?
I liked it a lot. It felt like they really stuck to the story of NWA.
I heard they had to cut a lot of stuff out of the movie.
They did. One of things was when Dr. Dre's beat up Dee Barnes, among other things.
I wonder why they did that? All of the true fans know what happened.
I heard that the movie ran too long and they had to trim it down.
That makes sense. I wonder how long it was.
I think the final cut was over 3 and a half hours long, so that's why they trimmed it.
Wow, that would be like watching a hip hop Lord Of The Rings!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, what's with all these mumble rappers on the radio like Future and Lil Uzi Vert?
Yeah man, I can never understand what any of them are saying in their songs.
Remember music like The Fugees and Mobb Deep? Whatever happened to good rap music?
Speaking of Mobb Deep, did you hear that Prodigy just died?
No way, I didn't know that! Do they know what happened to him?
Yeah, he was battling sickle cell anemia for years. Sad to see a legend like him pass.
Tell me about it man. The Infamous is probably one of my favorite rap albums of all time.
That's definitely a classic man, I've had it on repeat all day after hearing the news.
I'll make sure to pour out a 40 for him after I go to the liquor store. Rest in peace to the legend.
Totally man, come over. We'll have a couple beers and listen to some of his music in his honor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have so many favorite rap albums.
Can you narrow it down to a list, maybe?
I'm not sure. I don't think i can even pick just one to be honest.
Pick one that you like and tell me about it.
Alright then. I really loved Biggie's "Life After Death".
That's a very solid choice.
I just don't think that any album can touch it.
I mean, "Ready to Die" was a classic.
Oh, I forgot about that album.
That's an album that no one should forget.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to hip-hop music?
Not really man, unless The Roots on Jimmy Fallon counts.
I don't think that counts.
I watched Dave Chapelle's Block Party movie.  The Roots were in that.
I still say you can't count that, unless you're like watching the movie every day.
Yeah, well who should I listen to?
I don't know man.  I was hoping you listened to it so you could recommend some hip-hop to me.
I guess sometimes I do listen to NWA.
I've never heard of that.
It's great, you should check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So where do you find the hip hop artists you listen to?
Well it depends. The first PE song I heard was in a movie.
Which one?
The movie was something with Adam Sandler. The song was Give it Up.
And you liked it?
I thought it wasn't bad, so I wanted to check out their other stuff. If I'd never seen that movie I still might not know who they are today.
Awesome! And from there?
From there I see who they've been affiliated with. I've also discovered new artists just by doing a vague youtube search.
Find any good ones that way?
I've found a handful, two of which have become some of my favourites. Terawrizt and Trigger.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about future?
He is ok, Im not really that big of a fan.
Yeah, Im not that much of a huge fan either. My favorite project from him is monster.
yeah I heard monster. It was alright.
My favorite track from there is after that.
the one with lil wayne right? Yeah, I like that track too.
I listen to it everyday when Im coming home from work.
Thats whats up. My brother plays it all the time too.
I hope he makes a monster 2.
Yeah, me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i just heard that new plies album he's a great artist.
i love his music also he's in my top 20
yeah i like the album with the black mask, lol
full of diamonds that was one of his best one's
yeah he re mind me of master p
master p better though
u think so i was thinking the same thing
yep master p is one of the great black artist's
i agree, who you think is hot right know?
Future is a good young artist and holds his own!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like DMX?
Yes
What album do you like the most?
They are all good
Name one you like then
Grand Champ
Nice
I also like It's Dark and Hell is Hot
That's a good one
I love it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard Tribe called Quest just put out an album?
They did, its called We got it from here... thank you for your service.
That's a long album name.
It is.  But it was like 15 years since their last one, so its okay if its long.
Yeah, it has been a while.  Do you like it?
Yeah, one of the best albums I heard this year, hands down.
Does it still sound like them?
Yes, but better, more on point, focused and politial lyrics, really interesting beats and rythem.
Oh wow, whats your favorite song?
We the people, it definitly is the heart of the album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any good white rappers?
At least a few.
Vanilla Ice?
Vanilla Ice is not who I had in mind.
Eminem?
I prefer Eminem over Vanilla Ice.
So who is the best white rapper?
Why does everything have to be about race?
Beastie Boys?
Yeah, probably.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen SUPER BASS?
It is by singer NICKI MINAJ.
It looks like there are ice shoes.
And they have a pink car.
I guess she is rapping.
Or talking really fast.
She always looks really clean.
She has perfect makeup.
And she has perfect hair.
I guess ready for the muscle guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like female rappers?
There aren't any
You are wrong.
Okay. Name one.
Missy Elliot
Who is she?
I cannot believe you do not know her
I have never heard of her
She is the best female rapper ever
Cool. Let's hear an album of hers
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite rap song of all time
Wow thats a hard one theres so many to choose from
I loved Victory from Diddy, BIG, and Busta.
That was an huge track
The video had Dennis Hopper in it.
Yeah thats when music videos were huge.
What made you love the song
I thought it had all the elements necessary for a good rap track.
Did you like the hook
Yeah thats what drew me into the song
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
You into rap or hip hop at all?
Yeah I love it.
Oh cool, I don't listen to much of it myself.
Why not?
I don't know, doesn't really do it for me.  I can't get behind it.
I love it, it always gets me pumped up.
Pumped up?
Yeah like if I'm going to gym or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which rappers do you like?
I like J. Cole.
What album of his do you like?
"4 Your Eyez Only".
Interesting, which songs are your favorite from him?
Immortal and Deja Vu.
What about the song Change?
I like that one too.
He is very talented.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your first favorite rapper?
I would say Snoop Dogg
Why Snoop  Dogg?
He is really funny and he is just living the life of a G all day every day
He's been rapping for so long and he is still making some music!
When did his first album come out?
It came out in 1993
What was it called?
That album was called Doggystyle, which is a play on words
Oh yeah, I like that album! I like the song Gin and Juice
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old where you the first time you heard hip hop?
I was born in the 70's, so by the time i was ten i was listening to the best
Who was your favorite then?
Run D Mc
Were there any female rappers?
Yes there were a few
Did you listen to the Beastie boys?
Yes, one of my favorite songs was called paul revere
What do you like about hip hop?
I love the expression of the individuals feelings whatever they may be
XXXXXXXXXXX
I find that rap music more than any other genre can stir me to emotion.
I mean I've heard it's pretty angry music...
Not that, I mean it's diverse in the wide range of emotions it can contain, but there's some really sad stuff out there. Like some of the songs off of Tedashii's "Below Paradise".
I haven't listened to it.
Yeah, I think it's the speed of delivery that's so prevalent in the genre.
So it hits you with the sadness before you really know what hit you.
Exactly, with the slow sappy pop songs I can tell if it's leading to something sad and emotionally prepare myself for it, but with rap's typically rapid fire pace I don't get that.
Is that why you won't listen to Naughty By Nature's "Everything's Gonna Be Alright"?
It's about 10% the actual lyrics and the rest is because when I first heard that song I was going through a really hard time and being depressed and so every time I heard it it brings me right back to that place.
That's a shame, man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the new Kendrick Lamar?
Which one?
I think it was called DNA.
Oh yeah, that album was hot.
I think he might be the best out right now
He uses a crazy vocabulary in his rhymes
You can tell hes educated
I dont know about that, but he puts thought into his rhymes.
He says stuff no other rapper is talking about
Thats what sets him apart I believe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey are you going to the eightball mjg concert?
i did'nt know they where having one when
i think it's next week i'll have to check
i haven't heard from them in a while
the stilll rap good mjg is the best in my opinion
yeah i like hin better out of that group
they both sound good together though
yeah they do go good to getther can't have one without the other
i'll let you know when there new cd come out
please do i need some eightball and mjg in my life my wife lost my last cd
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rap song of all time?
That's a tough question because they have different feelings, so they aren't all comparable. I'll go with "Hypnotize" by the Notorious BIG.
Great song, a classic of the bragging style of rap. Sometimes you want more meaningful rhymes, sometimes just a great beat and fun lyrics.
Agreed. His "Juicy" song is definitely a more thoughtful song.
That's another classic. I was just listening to "Broken Wings" by Tupac the other day. The lyrics are like poetry.
You don't hear that much anymore in today's rap.
At least not on the radio, but if you look a little deeper you can find some really smart rappers.
Any recommendations?
Off the top of my head, Zion I is a good one, Kendrick Lamar is kind of straddling both worlds.
Yeah, good point. He's as much an artist as a rapper.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whatever happened to MC Ren?
I don't know dude. I haven't heard anything about him for years.
I guess he's like the lost 5th NWA Beatle. Gone and pretty much forgotten.
What about DJ Yella? Do you remember him?
Yeah and he's still around. He works in production and I believe does movies also.
Straight Outta Compton was an awesome album. Nothing like it had ever been created.
Who was your favorite member of NWA?
That's easy because it has to be Eazy. Cruisin' down the street in my 64.
Rap music was so much better back in the day. And look at what a lot of these guys have gone on to do with their careers.
You're right. Ice Cube is one of the biggest stars in the world and he came.........straight outta Compton.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how do you feel about Eminem's latest album?
Which one was his latest?
The Marshall Mathers LP 2 was the one.
Wait, so was that like a sequel to the first one.
Basically, that's what it was supposed to be.
Did you think it was as good as the first.
I really liked it a lot. I thought it felt like a more mature, focused version of the first one.
That definitely sounds interesting to say the least.
It is. Definitely check it out if you can.
I'll get on YouTube later today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of NWA?
I think they were pioneers in rap music.
Do you think they are an all time great group?
I would have to say yes.
What makes them so great?
They had some great people in the group.
It's strange Dr. Dre became the most successful.
I figured Easy E would have been the biggest.
He was at one point but then he died.
Yeah but his legacy will be one as a pioneer for AIDS research.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Jay Z changed how he's spelling his name?
No, but I know he has a new album coming out, 4:44
He's changing it to all caps, no hyphen: J-A-Y Z.
Why do people like him and Sean Combs, I mean Puffy, change their names all the time?
Not sure, it just seems confusing to me.
There's that new Tupac movie out.
The actor looks just like him. I will always love the song California.
That is a great one.
I wonder if we'd be calling him Wiz Tupak now if he'd lived.
And Biggie would be Big Notez!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Kendrick Lamar?
He's one of my favorite rappers. What's your favorite album?
Tough to pick, but probably 'Good Kid, MAAD City'. You?
Agreed, it's tough, but I guess 'To Pimp A Butterfly'.
You've heard 'Damn.', yes?
Yeah, and I think in time that will become my favorite Kendrick album. I love the music videos so far.
'DNA' had Don Cheadle in which I didn't see happening but I love it.
He did great, and Kendrick really went with the whole Kung Fu Kenny persona.
It fits with the style of music though, so I can see why.
He's just an extremely creative artist, which is rare nowadays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to 50 Cent?
Not sure he sort of disappeared
Yeah he was on top of the rap game for awhile
He rode the coattails of Eminem
I think he held up on his own
He sort of did.
I think he could have tried better
Did he produce any of his albums?
Eminem? I am sure he helped out on some.
I know he had guest spots
XXXXXXXXXXX
What ever happened to Nelly?
Who is that?
Nelly, the rapper.
Oh, yeah.  I don't know.
It's like he just disappeared.
Yeah, and he was pretty good.
What was his first song again?
Country Grammar.  He had a few songs from that album, then there was Hot in Herre from the next album.
Did he have any albums after that?
I think he has one double album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you know anything about Eminem?
Not really, is there something interesting about him?
Yes! Did you know he dropped out of school?
Really, what else?
He often made songs about his family. His mom, his ex-wife, and his daughter. His lyrics run deep.
That's interesting, what else has he done?
He starred in the movie, 8 Mile. It's about his life.
I'll have to check it out sometime.
Yeah, you should. It's really neat.
Thank you for telling me about Eminem!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you make of Kendrick Lamar's verse on Big Sean's Control?
Man, that was the best thing to happen in rap in 2013.
One of my favorite moments for sure too.
It was a call out to all rappers to start making real music, real hip hop, to get back to the roots. And he basically crowned himself the King of Rap in that song.
Yeah, I think it was a call to artistic arms that has since elevated the game.
Right, he calls out Tyler the Creator, Drake, Mac Miller, A$AP Rocky, and others and says he isn't rapping to be good. He's rapping to be the best.
Have you heard what Big Sean said about it?
What'd he say? That he didn't hear Kendrick's verse before recording his?
Well, he has said that in the past, but he somewhat recently said he thought he had the best verse on "Control."
Oh come on! No one thinks that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that Wu-Tang Clan are the best rap group of all time.
I thought that title was reserved for NWA.
It would be if they would have lasted longer.
But they still left a bigger impact than Wu-Tang did.
That's true. But Wu-Tang have been making consistently good music not just as a unit, but as solo members.
NWA's members are still putting out music.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that Wu are better because of their longevity.
I can understand that, but I feel like impact and influence outweigh longevity by a lot.
I can understand that.
Not to say I don't like Wu, though. They're still a great group.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Rap music?
I like it okay.
What do you like about it?
The beat is the best part.
What do you think about the bad language rappers use?
I can do without all that.
I wonder why most rappers feel the have to curse?
I think its because most people relate to it.
Oh I can relate to it but that doesn't mean I want to hear it put to music.
Me either I look for the artists that don't feel they have to take the approach.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man how was your weekend? I mostly chilled out to some Drake.
It was great! I just got back from a Drake concert last night!
No way, you're a fan of Drake too?
Yeah, i've been listening to him since he released "Thank Me Later".
Wow, so you're a long time fan, huh?
Yeah, what do you think of his latest album?
I mean I just started getting into his songs, but so far, I like what I hear.
Yeah, I really like everything on "Views", it really speaks to me.
I'll try to give it a listen tonight, talk to you later man!
Yeah, hit me up sometime, we should go see him live when he's back in town!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music?
Yes, most of the time.
Who is your favorite artist?
Kanye West is my favorite artist.
What song of his do you like the most?
The song "Golddigger" is one of my favorites.
Oh, do you have another favorite by Kanye?
Yes, I also like the song "Stronger".
Who is your second favorite rap artist?
I like Drake, especially the songs he does with female artists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Wiz Khalifa is a good rapper?
No, I think he might be the most overrated rapper ever.
Really? More overrated than 50 cent?
Maybe not that far.
You didn't like "Black and Yellow"?
I did like that song but that doesn't mean he's a good rapper.
True, that's more of a radio hit.
He basically just says "Black and Yellow" a million times and then it's over.
I wonder what the song was written about.
I heard it was about his pride for Pittsburgh. Those are their football colors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Drake music at all?
I do a good bit actually!
Isn't he hot?
Of course he is! I love his voice too.
Yes it's different. In a good way!
What's your favorite song of his?
I liked his song "Hotline Bling".
Me too! I remember when that came out.
The music video is kind of weird though.
It's a little strange. He looks great in it though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Nicki Minaj in ANACONDA.
She had a gun in her purse.
And she was high.
She said she only took half a pill.
She ain't missing no meals.
They do a lot of twerking.
And then they product placements.
Obviously in the skull.
And the girls touch each others butts.
It is a crazy video.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Eminem?
I think he is a great rapper. He's a lyrical genius!
I agree. What is your favorite rap of his?
I really like the song "Rap God". His wordplay is so clever!
Thats a good song but I definitely prefer his older stuff.
Which song is your favorite from his older music?
My favorite is the song "Forgot about Dre". Its one of his best songs.
His collaborations with Dre are always well done.
I really wish he would do more collaborations with Dre.
It really was some of his best work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like Hip-Hop?
Yeah, I love it. Why?
I just started getting into it, who are your favorite artists
Probably, Kendrick Lamar, Anderson .Paak, and Kanye
Who's Anderson .Paak?
He's a newer rapper, he makes really fun music
Anything I might have heard?
Maybe "The Dreamer"?
When did that come out?
He released it in 2016 with his album "Malibu"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Justin Timberlake is the king of pop
He is the king of entertainment
Was he better as a solo artist?
I think his time with N Sync served him well.
He is pretty good on SNL.
I dont know whats better his songs with Lonely Island or Jimmy Fallon.
He knows how to sing for sure.
And he knows how to perform
I loved his song Holy Grail
Is that with Jay Z? If so I loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you under the impression that Hip-Hop and rap are similar, or like the same?
No, not at all since rap clearly sucks.
What do you take 'rap' to be?
Well, clearly rap is poppy radio crap that has more repeated hooks than actual verses, right?
That is somewhat of an intricate approach to a larger explanation, though i certainly think it's clear where you're going with it.
Why, what would you say?
Of course random opinion is not relevant, rather as spoken from the mouths of the architects, "rap is business music & Hip-Hop is cultural music" .
Oh, damn well perhaps i like both.
Word, in the end the labels of Hip-Hop, Asian, skinny, hetero/homo, independent, or conservative are completely irrelevant and clearly harmful.
Yeah, too bad i'm too basic to care
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard POUND THE ALARM by Nicki?
Minaj makes good videos.
I like her outfit.
I like that big feather outfit.
She said sexy is all she do.
And if you need a bad bitch.
Music makes me high.
She makes happy songs.
She shuts it down.
And makes it hot on the floor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to a lot of Kid Cudi lately. You a fan of his?
Absolutely, he really speaks a lot of truth in his songs.
I know, I love how he talks about a lot of topics that affect society.
I think it is important for rappers to try to make a positive impact.
I think another person who does that is Kendrick Lamar.
He has produced some absolute classics lately.
I also like some of his older stuff. He keeps it real.
I still listen to songs like king kunta quite frequently.
His songs don't get old.
I listen to some of his albums on repeat pretty often.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite rapper?
personally, i would choose eminem.
I love him too!
really? thats great!
what songs are your favorie?
rap god and toy soldiers
i love till i collapse and when im gone
iv'e listended to those, they are really good too.
glad to hear that, you should listen to all his songs!
thats a bit much but sounds fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Eminem from Detroit?
Yes. He grew up there.
Did he rap there?
Yes. He worked on his craft when he was a young adult.
Then he became a star?
Yes. He had a lot of talent.
When was he popular?
In the 1990's.
Did you ever see 8 Mile?
Yes. There was some good freestyle rapping in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sometimes I'll just be chilling or running errands or something and out of the blue I'll think to myself, "Man, Slick Rick is so dope."
Well he is. Of course you do.
Why do you always do that?
What? Agree with you about Slick Rick's superior artistry? The man is a legend.
No, dummy. Act nonchalant about my deep musical thoughts.
I guess they aren't that deep, brother. You might as well say Jazzy Jeff is creative, or Biz Markie is a snazzy dresser. Or Kanye's a--
Don't even start with that.You know how I feel about Yeezus.
Yeah, I do. I think you actually like him more than Rick the Ruler.
Apples and oranges, homefry.
Legends and egomaniacs is more like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Today I've been listening to Isaiah Rashad.
Nice, which album?
The Sun's Tirade.
What's your favorite song so far?
Probably "Free Lunch" or "Silkk da Shocka"
I liked that album, and "Free Lunch" is my favorite song as well.
Did you ever see the video?
For free lunch? Yeah I've seen it.
Chill video as well.
If this were the only song I had to listen to for the rest of my life I'd be satisfied.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite rap artist?
I do. I think it would have to be Kendrick Lamar.
Man, he is such a great rapper.
Yea, I like his music, but I also like the message behind his words.
True. He is so talented and makes good music.
Yea, I just bought his album Good Kid M.a.a.d city on vinyl and can't stop playing it.
Oh man, that is a great album. I love the song Drank.
You mean Swimming Pools?
Yea. That one. Also, Bitch Dont Kill my Vibe is such a nasty, but great song
I couldn't agree more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this new guy i have been listening to is legit
Who is he
His name is hopsin and he is old school and down to earth
I know him
He is good right
He is OG for sure
His beats and rhymes are mesmerizing
For real man
i wish i had heard of him earlier
Same bro
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does any one know of any good rap cd's
yeah mistakal is one of the good rappers i like.
How much is his last c?d
It shoud'nt be  to high it's worth it.
what's his best cd.
who's the man is a good rap he made.
does he rap with master p.
yeah they have several cd's they made with each other.
where do they sell his cd's.
i would check online first and then best buy, one of those will have it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite rapper?
I like Jay-Z and Drake.
Did you hear that Jay-Z and Beyonce had their babies?
Yeah, I guess we won't be getting another album from him any time soon.
That song he did with MIA a few years ago was really good, I think it was called XXXO.
I liked that album but I really preferred his old stuff like Hard Knock Life.
That's true, his older stuff was better.  Ever since he had his "retirement party" it feels like his stuff just isn't as fresh.
After The Black Album is when it started to go downhill for me.
I wish he would collab with some of today's artists and come out with a really good album.
Yeah, but like I said he probably won't be able to work on anything for a while.  Plus, he kind of isn't that relevant anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to DMX?
I think he got into drugs
I mean his career fell off
Yeah Whats my Name was a great single though
Oh definitely and he had a raspy voice you needed for that track.
He tried acting
I think he tried a bunch of stuff.
But yeah whats my name embodied rap at the time.
Yeah I agree it was crucial to the point that it defined a decade.
That was really the last of violent rap that we have heard
XXXXXXXXXXX
How does she walk like that?
And they make all the smoke come out her mouth.
I think they used computer stuff to make her move.
She got gold on her necklace.
And gold on her wrist.
And the boys want a kiss.
She got herself a 40.
And she also got a shorty.
They have a lot of extras in the video.
But they are having fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the artist Future?
I do! He makes rap and hip hop music, right?
He does! He did an album with Drake a few years ago.
But he makes solo music too, doesn't he?
He does! He has a song that is very popular right now.
What is it called?
The title is "Mask Off"
Interesting title. What things does future rap and sing about?
The topics vary, but he frequently references women, money, clothes, cars, and things like that.
Rappers tend to talk about those topics a lot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the artist that goes by Viktor Vaughn, MF Doom, DOOM, and Madvillain?
He originally went as Zevlove X and was in the group K.M.D.
So he's from Long Island, NY, originally?
Yes, isn't that weird. He's from Long Beach.
Well, I didn't realize he got his start in KMD, I thought he was just some underground dude who came from nowhere.
Nah, he definitely came from KMD. Do you have a favorite MF Doom, DOOM, Viktor Vaughn, et cetera, project?
I don't really know enough. What's your favorite project?
my favorite is Madvillain which is a collaboration by Madlib and MF Doom.
Who's Madlib?
He's a great rapper from Stones Throw. He does it all: DJing, production, and rapping.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like ja rule
Yes he is a great artist
I love his music
Me too
I especially love when he makes songs with Ashanti
Yes me too
Always on time is a great song
Yes i love listening to it
He has a good voice
Yes he does
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh man, I've been listening to this Frank Ocean album all day. Its really great, thank you.
I'm so glad that you like it. Would you like to go see him with me?
I would love to go. When is the show?
Its next Tuesday in the city at 9:00 p.m.
I'll definitely go with you. I hope he plays "Nature Feels."
Oh me too, I love dancing to that one.
Can I please borrow his second album from you? I'd like to copy it.
Sure, its called Blonde, I'll bring it to the show for you.
Great thank you so  much.
You're welcome! I'll see you next Tuesday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the old boy bands from the 90s?
Like Nsync?
Yes exactly like that.
I don't like them at all, they seem to hit a market of young to teen girls and that's really it.
I never understood it either.
I don't understand it either, how can you like that music.
I guess for teen girls or women in general it can be good but not me.
Yeah guess you shouldn't knock it if you aren't the type or something like that.
Did you ever listen to their music before?
Yeah I heard a few songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Lil Wayne?
Not really.  I know who he is though.
Do you like his music?
I mean, some of his songs are pretty catchy, but I'm not a fan.
What is your favorite song by him?
Probably Lollipop.  My mom actually loves that song.
Really?  Does she know what it's about?
Nope, but I'm not gonna tell her!
That's pretty funny.
Yeah, my mom riding around singing a Lil Wayne song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hey.
Do you like rap or hip hop music?
Yeah sure.
Who do you think you like right now?
I like Kendrick Lamar a lot right now.
Why do you like him?
He's got great lyrics.  He's really deep.
I hear a lot of people say that about him.
He is really progressive with his music and I like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What ever happened to that rapper C-murder?
He's serving life in prison without the possibility of the parole at the Angola State Prison in Louisiana.
Jesus christ. What happened? This is the first time I'm hearing anything about this.
The entire sequence of events is pretty crazy but long story short he was convicted of killing some 16 year old kid outside of a Louisiana nightclub in 2003.
2003? I know for sure he released an album in like 2008 or 2009.
That's why I said crazy sequence of events. He had like 3 different trials for the murder, but Louisiana has some messed jury laws and he was eventually convicted and setenced in 2009.
I always loved his music. That's really sad to hear. Life in prison with no parole is no joke.
Yeah I agree. You know his brother his Master-P right? I think C-murder is trying to get his case heard by U.S. Supreme Court.
I know his brother is Master-P. Oh wow, the Supreme Court? That'd be insane if he eventually got out of prison.
I really hope he does, I don't think he's guilty but instead staying to true to his roots. I've heard some people in New Orleans say that Souja Slim actually killed the 16 year old kid but C-Murder is so real that he wasn't going to rat out his now deceased friend for committing the murder.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite female rap artist?
my favorite is lil Kim
yeah shes good and one of the first
did you see what happened with her in the news lately
no what happened?
she is a suspect in a robbery out in L.A. some people in ski masked robbed this guy to get her 20,000 deposit on a property rental back
thats crazy
yeah she's always into something
whats your favorite song by her
that would have to be crush on you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music?
Not really but I know a lot of people do.
I am not a big fan either but I am aware of some rappers.
Yeah, isn't Drake a rapper?
I think so.  I think Kanye West and Jay J are too.
I've always thought that rap music was really rough and harsh.
That and very sexist.  I mean, I've heard somewhere where they rap about raping women and stuff.
I've heard that too.  Personally rap music just makes me really uncomfortable.
Me too.  It seems like a way to get people angry and riled up.
And then they go and do bad things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you like better, the old Snoop Dogg music or newer Snoop Dogg?
That's a really tough call because all his music is great!  But I guess I'd have to say Doggystyle was his best.
Yeah, I can play that entire album over and over again.
Oh, I do, all the time.  His newer stuff has slightly more complex beats.
It seems a little different, yes.  He branched out in another direction.
But it's still great.  I love everything he's ever done.
He's definitely one of the best hip hop artists of all time.
Along with Tupac for sure.
Yeah, I wish they had done more music together.
Yeah, they would make a truly amazing duo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rap song do you know every single word to?
Oh man, Afroman's Palmdale. I would like sit at home and play that song for hours.
Never heard of it, all I know is that song Because I Got High.
Ha, that's a good one too. "I was gonna clean my room, but then I got high."
I think I for sure know every single lyric to Jay-Z's 99 Problems.
I think I do too! That song is such a classic, I feel like probably everyone has heard of it.
For real. But you know what? I don't really listen to that much Jay-Z.
Me neither actually. I think most of the time I hear him featured on one of Kanye's songs or something.
You're right. The last song I heard by him was Shining, but that was on DJ Khaled's new album and it featured Beyoncé.
Oh I will listen to anything featuring Beyoncé.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you find appealing about rap?
Oh, several things. It makes me think more than other music, for instance.
About what?
Life in general, but more important it's the way it makes me think.
How do you mean?
Well the genre has a way or presenting things in a way you might not have thought about them before, and encouraging critical thinking and discernment and questioning everything.
Such as?
Oh, news media, the reasons behind a lot of actions by organizations.
I like rap that's about positive things, and not "crazy wild rap".
That's valid. To each their own.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know one artist who I thought was nasty.
Nasty? Who do you mean?
He rapped that one song "Crank That".
You mean Soulja Boy?
Yes him! He looked so nasty.
I guess so. I kind of thought he was cute.
Well we may have different taste but I hated that song.
I'll be the first to say he was not a favorite but the song wasn't bad in my opinion.
I think he could use more original ideas in his music.
I'm not even sure he makes music anymore actually.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of 50 cent?
Yes of course.
Do you like his music.
He was one of my favorites a long time ago.
That changed?
Yes, he just stopped producing music really.
Yeah I guess you're right he hasn't produced an album for a long time.
Yeah so long I don't even remember his last album.
I wonder why did he just lose interest in rap?
I'm not sure but I imagine that's why.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am not a huge rap fan but I do love Outkast.I used to listen to them alot.
Outkast? What did  they sing that I would know?
You don't remember Andre 3000 and Big Boi? He was in the movie Idlewild
Umm not those names but if you tell me a song I probably will.
Hey Ya, Ms Jackson are two that were on the radio. Do you remember those?
Yes I know who you are talking about now! yes they were pretty good.
I liked their album ATLiens. Also I remember going and buying the double album Speakerboxxx/Love Below the day it came out.
Wow you really did like them. I have never know you to be that quick to buy music.
I know but these guys were fun. It was a special time in my life.
I know what you mean. The music you identify with during certain times of your life have a huge impact on you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music?
Um, it's ok. I don't dis like it. But I'm also not a big fan.
I feel the same.
But I do like it when it's late and I'm driving. It helps to keep me alert.
That's neat. If I'm going to listen to it I like to hear deep bass.
Like apple bottom jeans by T-Pain?
Yeah. That's a good one. Probably good for driving too.
It is. I really like the old snoop dogg and Dr. dre.
Like the next episode and Ain't nuthin but a g Thang.
Yep exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
whats your favorite rapper
probably j cole
really? he isnt that interesting
his lyrics though.
he's real but boring.
have you heard breakdown or firing squad?
yes i have.
how are they boring.
he is no kendrick
okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like ja rule
Me too
He is a great artist
I love his pain is love album
Me too
That's the one always on time is on
That's one of my favorite songs.
Mine too
I love Ashanti
And she is so pretty
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, is there any argument over who the best rapper of all time is?
Not for me, it is Tupac hands down.
I agree, what do you think his best song was?
For me it would be Dear Mama.
I love that song, he really admired his mother.
What would be your favirote?
I feel like Hail Mary has the best beat of all time.
Yea that one was a great track. Have you ever heard California Love?
Yea, that may have been his most popular song.
Ghetto gospel is another great song of his.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hi.
Do you listen to rap or hip hop?
Yeah sure.
What era do you like?
What era?
Yeah like 80's, 90's, now.
I liked the 90's a lot.  Biggie and Tupac and all that.
Don't forget Snoop.
Yeah Snoop and Ice Cube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
whats your favorite kendrick song
probably hiiipower
YO, that song is amazing and it features alori
rest in peace to her.
she was a great singer and ab souls girlfriend.
kendrick used her well in the song too.
that beat is amazing too.
it was made by j cole?
really? i didnt know he was that good.
hes a good producer
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Vanilla Ice?
He was so popular when I was in middle school!
What ever happened to him?
I know around 2000 he was touring as a hard rock act.  My brother went see him at a local bar.
Seriously, rock?
Yeah, he's not into rap anymore.
Does he still do performances?
I don't know.  I think he had gotten into trouble, but he had straightened up.
So what does he do now?
I think he has some kind of remodeling home show on TV.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is Eminem's best song?
Wow that's a tough question.
I think 'Stan' is a really good song.
I think it's pretty good, but not the best.
Well, what's your favorite.
I think 'Rap god' is one of his best.
Why do think that's one of his best?
It shows how far his skills have grown.
He really has become a really great rapper.
That's why I think 'rap god' is his best it shows his skills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about Anderson Paak, huh? Is he talented or what?
God, I love him. He has a voice like no other.
Ever seen those live session videos online?
Yeah, those are such a treat to watch. He's really passionate about his work.
That's one of the things that makes him such a master.
He's done some stuff with Tokimonsta, too.
Ah, yes. Realla is absolutely brilliant. The video is gorgeous, too.
Not just Realla. Don't forget Put it Down.
Another great track. Which album is that one on?
Fovere. I think that's the latest one. They work together a lot, though. I'd expect to see more collaborations in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard some shocking news today about Prodigy.
Yeah from Mobb Deep? What happened?
He just died in Las Vegas. They don't really know how he died yet.
What? Wow. That guy was a legend.
Yeah. He was only 42 years old. His real name was Albert Johnson.
Wow! He had been battling sickle cell anemia all his life.
They think it might be related to that. He was hospitalized a few days before.
I had Mobb Deep's album called "Juvenile Hell" and it was great.
Yeah, that was back in 1993. It's terrible that he's gone.
Yeah, too young and too soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which one is a better lyricist: Andre 3000 or Big Boi?
If we're talking creativity, Andre. Flow, then Big Boi.
Interesting, why do you think so?
I think Andre had better wordplay and utilized the meaning of his lyrics for good.
Okay, but Big Boi told stories that were compelling. How about this?
While I definitely agree with that, Andre 3000s creativity added additional spark to the stories that he told.
Okay, so on International Player's Anthem, who had the better verse?
Definitely Andre. That intro is iconic.
Okay, I definitely feel that. Don't neglect the depth that Big Boi's verse had.
Of course not, but Andre's is remembered by more fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about music
Okay great
What kind of music do you like?
I really like rap music
Oh okay
Do you like rap music too?
Yea its okay
Its pretty much all i listen to
I like some artists
I like them all
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Do you listen to rap often?
Not to often, but I don't hate it.
I'm the same way.
What kind of rap music do you like?
I like hip hop, like 90's stuff.
like gangsta rap?
Yeah I guess so, I don't like that term.
Oh okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So when did you stop listening to rap music?
About the time Bobby Brown was singing his tender Roni.
Oh man! That was... What? The Eighties?
There are a few rap and hip-hop songs I like. Most of them are older though.
Like what?
Well, I really liked Bobby Brown's early stuff. I like Gangsta's paradise.
Do you even know who sung that?
No idea. I like Iced Tea. He's good in that NCIS show.
So you like him as an actor. Not a singer.
Is Rap musicians even considered singers?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about rap music?
I really like some of it, but I like classic rap music than the newer rap music.
Who is your favorite rap artist or rap group?
There are so many good ones, but I love The Sugarhill Gang.
Wow! That's some old school rap! I love their song called Rapper's Delight.
Yeah, I like that one too! Who do you like as far as rap goes?
I love the group called Arrested Development. They were big in the 1990's.
I remember them, I loved the song called Mister Wendal.
Yes, I loved that song too! They were a great group.
I wonder where they are now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rap music have you been listening to lately?
I have been listening to Meek Mill.
Oh cool, what song?
Whatever You Need.
Oh I should take a listen some time.
What songs have you been listening to?
Big Fish by Vince Staples.
I have never heard of Vince Staples.
He is up and coming.
Interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like hip hop or rap?
Yeah a little bit.
Not a lot?
No, I wouldn't say a lot.
Do you have a favorite artist?
I like a lot of 80's stuff.  So maybe Run DMC.
Those guys are legends.
Yeah rap wouldn't be where it is today without them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what kind of music is your favorite type?
mostly hip-hop, sometimes rap, but not as much.
me too, I loved Lil U zi Vert, he's such a great hip hop artist
yea, me and my friends listen to a lot of his music, it's very chill
how about you, what's your favorite?
I don't know if he's my favorite, but I like a song from G-Eazy
Oh, G-Eazy, he's very unique in his style
yes indeed, the song is called Guala
oh, I remember that song, he keeps calling Guala, guala, right?
yes, it's so funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the difference between rap and hip-hop? I so often confuse the two.
I know exactly what you mean. I think hip-hop is bit more upbeat.
Ok, so hip-hop is like rap that you can dance to?
Something like that! I would say Kanye West is an example of hip-hop music.
Ok, so kind of a middle ground between rap and pop.
Kanye, Eminem, 50 Cent are some good example of hip-hop music.
Many people would say all three of them are rappers....not hip-hop artists.
Hmmm, maybe you're asking the wrong person! I'm not an expert by any means.
I thought you loved rap.
I do love rap. I love rap and hip-hop. The more that I think about it, maybe they're just interchangeable names for the same thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which do you think was better? Illmatic or Reasonable Doubt?
Reasonable Doubt, of course.
You didn't like the classic Illmatic? With the beats by Premier and everyone?
Not saying that I didn't like Illmatic, but Jay's delivery on Reasonable Doubt was timeless.
Okay, so what exactly made Reasonable Doubt so good to you?
I loved the innocence of Jay-Z and how his perspective was so young and hungry.
I can definitely feel that, especially on Can I Live and Regrets.
Also, Dead Presidents, Brooklyn's Finest, so many tracks.
Illmatic had fire too. But I can see more consistency with Reasonable Doubt now that you say that.
Yes, that's exactly what Reasonable Doubt had: consistency.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate the type of rap music that's popular now. It's so meaningless.
You sound like my mother... While I don't identify with it, I still respect it.
Why would you? It does nothing but support violence, bad values, and we have no idea what they're saying!
I don't like country music either, but who am I to judge people that do. At the end of the day, lot of young people like the new rap, and there are even a few great artists that are inspirational.
They're all terrible. Name One that is inspirational.
Kendrick Lamar is.
I wouldn't call Kendrick Lamar rap. He's more like pop these days.
Kendrick Lamar is 100% rap. It's not even hip-hop - it's pure rap.
I have to admit that he is a good example. He's the only rapper who I've ever heard giving positing messages in his music.
So you haven't heard of Nas, Common... shall I go on? Maybe you need to listen to rap more instead of making generalized stereotypes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which do you prefer? East coast hip hop or West Coast hip hop?
I live on the East coast so I want to say East coast, even though I'm not sure I know what the difference is.
There's a difference in terms of rapping style. It's always been a topic of discussion and feud over which is better.
Give me some examples of artists from each coast.
Some East coast rappers are Jay Z from Brooklyn, and Nas from Queens
And on the west coast there's Snoop Dogg.
Exactly! Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre. One of the biggest rivalries that best shows the East vs West feud was the rivalry between Tupac and Bigge
Tupac was from the west and Biggie from the East right?
That's right.
It's hard to choose sides when both coasts have such great talent!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Nas rhymed better than anyone
NO way he was a great stylist though.
How can you not say Illmatic was dope.
It was good but not the greatest.
I dont know if you know your rap.
Enough to know I can name 2 better artists than Nas.
OK then name them
Tupac and Biggie
Wow they are probably 2 great ones.
Great ones? They were both better than Nas!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about this young rapper named Matt OX?
I think he's a cool lil' guy.
You listen to many of his songs?
Yeah, but I can't say that i'm that big of a fan. I can see why he's getting popular though.
I can't think of a setting where I'd want to listen to his songs.
I bet his songs bang at parties.
Maybe. I'd probably leave the party if they started playing his music.
Ha, don't hate on him, his song "Overwhelming" is amazing, that's a hit record.
Alright, I agree with that. I think his producer Oogie Mane is amazing.
I see a lot more hit songs coming from this kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like that song Express Yourself from NWA?
Yes
That has a great melody
I think the melody is from an older song
The rap is really good.
I agree. Ice Cube and Dre do a great job.
I like the overall message of the song.
Me too
Do you have any album of theirs?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music?
Yes i do
Thats good
Do you like rap music?
Yes
Who do you like?
I really like eminem
Hes really good
I love his song
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer guy rappers or girl rappers?
Do you think there's a big difference?
I think girls tend to rap a bit harder because they think they need to prove themselves.
I'm not sure about that.
Well look at Angel Haze or Cupcakke.
But Busta Rhymes goes just as hard.
Yeah, but female rappers make it a point to never be lazy.
That's true. Azealia Banks is another one.
Also M.I.A., although she definitely blurs the lines between rap and electronic.
She's too experimental for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Drake?
I don't really care for him.
Why not?  I think he's a pretty good rapper.
He seems talented enough, but he just seems fake.
Why do you say that?
My little sister used to watch a kids show that he was on.  Now he's trying to come out all hard.
Oh, so it kills the vibes.
Exactly.  I just see him as a guy on a kid's show.
I wonder how many of his fans from that show listen to him now.
He actually changed his name, so I don't know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen j cole live?
yeah, i have
i wish i could soon.
he really isnt worth it.
how so?
all he does i stand around and rap
that was how it is in the past
but he had no stage design or anything unique
he just wants to stand alone and bring it back to the old school.
i guess so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Enough of what the critics or the community wants us to think, who is your favorite rapper or rap group of all-time?
Tough question. It'd have to be Outkast for me.
I miss Outkast, I really wish they'd put out another album.
I know, it has been so long since I've heard Andre 3000 and Big Boi together. I miss them.
I miss them too, luckily their music has resonated with so many people and that means we hear their sound all over contemporary stuff.
Right, I was listening to To Pimp a Butterfly and Yeezus last night and thinking about how these albums would be starkly different had Outkast not existed.
Wow, now I'm thinking about a Kendrick Lamar and Outkast collaboration. That'd be so cool.
No man, that'd be cooler than cool, it'd be ice cold! Sorry, that was super corny of me to quote "Hey Ya!"
Corny, but I'll take it. Is that your favorite Outkast song of all time?
No, but it's up there. B.O.B. will probably always be my favorite, I had the good fortune to get to listen to the isolated vocals for that track and I don't know how that amount of rapping in one breath is possible
XXXXXXXXXXX
This is a trip! I just seen the BIGGIE Movie last night. Did you see Tupac's?
No I haven't but it looks so good.
Yes, I love old rap and hip hop. I'm Naughty by Nature, not cause I hate cha.
Look at Ice Cube, just seen him in a hilarious movie called Fist Fight.
Snoop Dogg will always be the dogfather.
Heelyeah. I loved Warren G and Mace.
Are they still alive?
I have no idea bro. R.I.P Tupac and Biggie.
Do you like the new age rap hip hop?
Oh no, it's not good and they rip off so many old riffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i heard a new 2pac song today
i thought we heard them all.
no he got stuff you probably won't hear for awhile
where did you hear his new song
i was scrolling on the web
is it a good song
yes one of the best one's i heard
can you give me the sight where you found it
yeah wait until i get off they got's lots of new rappers on there to
ok call me when you get off i need that sight, been looking for some good rap music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is better, Kendrick Lamar or J. Cole?
That's a hard one, but I'll have to go with J.Cole.
It is a hard one, but Kendrick Lamar's "D.A.M.N" album makes him one of the greats.
I won't argue with you on that. Track 2, DNA, was epic.
Yes! I play that one and track 7, Loyalty featuring Rihanna almost every day.
I like how that album is different from his previous albums.
Me too. He really showed his skill and knowledge.
I agree. He also still told a story throughout the album.
He did! It sounded like he told a couple of stories throughout the album depending on how deep you listened to what he was saying.
I heard. I read that on the blogs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like Prodigy?
I really liked his music and his personality.
It was sad that he died today.
Yes, today was a very sad day in hip hop.
I really liked him and his friend Havoc.
Yes, they created a great duo.
I can remember as a child how Mobb Deep just make me love hip hop.
I agree, this was one of the first rap groups that I listened to.
He will be greatly missed by the hip hop community.
Prayers up for him and his family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That's the kind of stuff I like, those Irish guys you sent me.
Class A'z?
Yeah, I like their flow. Kind of reminds me of Tupac.
Really? I didn't think they were similar at all.
Well to me they are.
What is it exactly you like?
Just how smooth and flowing and relaxed it is.
I gotcha. I find Tupac's aural components relaxing whereas Class A'z lyrical construction relaxes me.
I think that's what I mean.
Yeah and like that music video of their I sent you I thought was a good example of that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to any new rap these days
Actually i am a fan of the old stuff
Really? How old?
Mostly stuff from the 80s, thats when rap was legendary
Who is your favorite artist
Personally I love NWA
Really, why them?
That group is filled with so many great rappers, and was basically the start of it all
Who is your favorite out of NWA
Eazy E is the best
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the best hype up rapper in the game?
Jeezy for sure! Have you heard him.."I put on for my city, on on for my city."
Jeezy is up there for sure. I think Lil Jon has the best hype game though.
Yeah, "Get Low" and "Turn Down for What" go hard for sure.
Don't forget "Snap Yo Fingers" either. That was my go to song when I was getting ready to go out to the club in college.
That is a great one.
We'd be totally remiss if we didn't mention FLA-VOR FLAV!
Ha! Ha! Ha! That's true, I'm not a big fan, but he's essential hype man.
Yeah, if a university offered a Hypeman 101 course, he'd get at least a week of study.
Oh, for sure. Flavor Flav was one of the first to do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the difference between rap and hip hop?
I have no idea.
I think hip hop is just popular rap.
Isn't most rap popular?
Alot of it is but no all of it.
What isn't popular?
Well, there are a lot of rappers you've never head of.
So any rapper I've heard of is a hip hop artist?
No I don't think that's true.
I'm so confused right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best rapper in your opinion
I love Eminem
What! He is so overrated. i hate him
Why is that?
His lyrics are all a bunch of jokes. Maybe back when Lose Yourself debuted he was great but now he is terrible
What recent stuff have you heard.
I heard that one song he was featured in by Big Sean
No favors?
yeah that song
Yeah it was pretty weak in my opinion
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Tupac the best of all time in hiphop?
No, I liked Biggie better.
Why is Biggie better to you?
Well it depends on how you look at it.
What do you mean?
When it comes to lyrics Biggie is better, when it comes to overall track record Tupac is better.
Tupac was also a great person to me.
I agree, he did a lot for the community.
Their death was tragic to the entire nation.
It was, I wish it would have just stayed with rap and not turned violent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite music video?
One of my favorites is Nicki Minaj in Anaconda.
I think they had lemons on a turn table.
And they had booty shorts.
They had the cut off shorts.
Oh my gosh.
Look at her butt.
And there was Micheal.
He used to ride motorcycles.
She would play with his rifle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me some of the rap music you have been listening to lately.
I have been listening to Kodak Black.
I have never heard of him.
Yeah he is gaining in popularity.
What song should I listen to by him?
First Day Out.
I will make a mental note to do that.
I also like 2 Chainz.
What song?
4 AM.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo i got a question for you
What is good
Do you like videos
Like youtube stuff
Yeah that sort of thing
I do
You should check out this Internet rapper called pink guy
Is he good
He is amazing he did a rap with the EDM guy Getter
Sounds pretty chill
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the newer rap?
Not really. I prefer the older stuff like Eminem.
What is your favorite song of his?
My Name Is
Do you like Dr. Dre?
Yes, I love him and Ice Cube
NWA was a great group
Yeah, I love Express Yourself.
That is one of my favorite songs.
They have many other good ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Mase?
Yeah he was in the bad boys song right
Wasnt that his own song?
Yeah I think you are right.
I thnk he became a pastor
He was the next big thing
No I dont think he was that big.
You better believe he was
He had a nice cameo on Mo Money
Yeah he stole that song
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
You into rap or hip hop?
Sure it's alright by me.
Have a track you have been listening a lot to lately?
I really like Redbone.
Who's that by?
Childish Gambino.
Oh I think I know that track.  Is it kind of old school?
Yeah that's the one.  It's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to Nas?
Yeah, I loved Nas!  His first album was amazing.
I know, it came out when, like in 1998 or so?
Yeah it was something like that.  It was truly novel at the time.
I know, I remember being really impressed.  Did he make more albums after that?
I really couldn't tell you.  I think so.
He kinda reminded me of Tupac in the first one.
Yeah, there were some similarities.  His music was definitely deep.
Yeah, it wasn't like the cheap shallow rap you often hear.
No, definitely not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
so what do you think about hip hop music?
I listen to them a lot, they tend to be very loose and ruthless, haha
true, I feel sometimes people just need that kind of vibe as a mean of release from society's pressure
I agree, this category of music is a lot of times, violent and contains a lot of dirty lines. But you know what?
what?
I like them, I listen to them everyday.
me too.
Is there a favorite artist in this category?
If I have to choose, it could be Lil Uzi  Vert
Ahh, I heard of his music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
fav pac song?
dear mama.
come on. pick something else.
its my favorite though.
but thats everyones choice. you got something better
shed so many tears
that song is a classic.
"my soul couldnt find a place to rest until i got that thug life tatted on my chest"
it wasnt even on his chest though
it was on his belly
XXXXXXXXXXX
What hip-hop artist dropped classic first albums in your opinion?
I think B.I.G's Ready to Die was a game changer for sure.
Yeah that album definitely gave the NYC rap scene it's power back.
What artist would you say dropped a classic first?
I'm a have to say Nas with illmatic.
That album was way ahead of it's time for sure.
You could listen to it today and still find some hidden gems on it.
That's a fact. I think Eminem had a classic first album as well.
For sure, the entire music industry never heard anything like it before.
I bet Nas even has to admit to himself that Eminem's first album was insane.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you consider Iggy Azalea a rapper?
Yeah I would say she is
Fancy did not have that much rap lyrics in it.
Yeah that was to bridge her into the mainstream.
I mean she rapped some of the parts of it but not the entire thing.
I would consider her a white Nicki Minaj
Thats quite a comparison.
Not like minaj is anything special though.
I dont know I feel like they dont write their own lyrics
They definitely do not, they are performers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who used to be super popular that you don't think about anymore?
Who is that?
Lil Jon. He was wild.
Yes I remember him! He always worse sunglasses.
Yep. I think it was actually Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz.
Yes they rapped that one song "Get Low". That used to be the jam.
I would play that song in my friend's dorm room and we'd dance to it.
Those were fun times.
That's the kind of music you listened to if you wanted to get hyped up.
Yep, fun times!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Who's your favorite rapper?
I don't know if I have a favorite, not a huge fan.
If you had to pick one who would it be?
I really like Wiz Khalifa.
I've heard that name, but I don't know if I've listened to anything by him.
Really, he's all over the radio.
I usually listen to XM and don't catch a lot of rap.
Oh I see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
East Coast or West Coast? Who you got?
I really don't care about which coast or where you came from. I just like cool music.
I'm with you. The rap coast war was very destructive to the genre and the community.
I was a Biggie and Public Enemy fan back in the day, and a fan of 2 Pac and NWA.
Me too, I liked groups and artists on both sides of the country. I never had a bias towards one or the other.
Groups like Outkast and guys like Eminem kind of dissolved that beef didn't they?
What about Kid Rock? He was a Detroit kid and I heard his first album in the early 90's.
He's been around for a lot longer than people realize hasn't he?
Yup, and he's still doing his thing today and he does different styles of music.
I think it would be cool if Eminem did like a southern rock song thing. It would blow people away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Chance the Rapper?
Of course I know Chance the Rapper man. I don't live under a rock.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I figured.
Chance 3 was my favorite album last year.
Same. It was my favorite album overall and a big departure for him.
Yeah, it was more Gospel sounding, had a lot of features, and was way more produced.
I still really liked it despite the features and high production not sounding great on paper.
I love that he has such a positive message.
Yeah, have you heard his brother's music?
Yeah, his brothers name is Taylor Bennett, right? I've heard his collaboration with Kweku Collins called Vanilla Skies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of the girl in TLC that did the rapping?
Left Eye?
Yeah, her.  Didn't she die?
Yeah, like ten or fifteen years ago.
That's what I thought.  What had happened?
She got into a car accident in South America or somewhere.
That's a shame.  She was really talented.
Yeah, she kind of opened the door for a lot of female rappers.
Yeah, she was probably a role model to a lot of stars now.
I'm sure she was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to Snoop Dogg's music at all?
I did a little bit. I like his voice.
Remember that song he rapped called "Murder" or something like that?
I do! It was kind of a different song.
I think he wrote that because he was accused of murder.
You're right I remember that. He was acquitted though.
Yep. I watched part of the trial.
I was a huge fan of his song "Gin and Juice" also.
Me too!
I wish they still rapped like they used to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any rap music lately?
Yeah I have been listening to some Young Thug.
He is rather entertaining.
I listen to the song On Fire.
Oh cool. That is from the Beautiful Thugger Girls album right?
That is right.
I have some songs from that album.
Which ones?
She Wanna Party and Daddy's Birthday.
Oh interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the latest Childish Gambino album?
I've only heard a couple of songs from it.
Which ones?
Redbone and Riot.
Redbone is the stand out track on the album, but it's not my favorite.
Which one is your favorite track?
I really like Me and your Mama.
I've seen some websites giving that track really good reviews.
Yeah, it's really easy to get into, and I catch new things in it every time I listen.
I'll have to add it to my playlist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
YOu know of this odd type of rap
What type is it and how is it odd
Well it is rap but it is called horror core
What does it sound like
It is like horror themed rap
Can you name some artists
Yeah their is Twisted and Boondox
I have listened to twisted i enjoy it
I just find it weird
But why
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see that new Tupac movie?
I'm thinking about it, but I've heard it wasn't good. A lot of inaccuracies.
They seem to be making a lot of movies about rap and hip-hop artistes these days.
I saw Straight Outta Compton and thought it was good.
For sure, that was probably one of the better ones. But the actual artists were involved in the production, so I'm not surprised it was so good.
What other rappers do you think there should be a movie about?
I'd like to see a movie about Queen Latifah.
Why her?
She's such a role-model for many type of minorities. She's a woman in business, black, LGBT, and has been able to be super successful after her start as a rapper.
Best of all, she's a very well respected actress now! She could act as herself!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to trap music?
No, I don't. Do you?
Yes, that's where some of the best artists in rap music are headed towards these days. The sounds are awesome.
What are your favorite trap music artists?
I love Future, Migos, and Gucci Mane is such a classic.
OH yeah, I used to listen to Gucci Mane a long time ago.
Do you remember that song called Freaky Girl by Gucci Mane?
Yeah, that was my jam. It's kind of dirty though.
Who else do you listen to?
2 Chainz is another good trap artist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, SZA is really blowing up right now.
I remember when she was sort of underground.
Yeah, but she did those tracks with Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper on Z.
After that everybody knew about her. You don't get names like that and stay underground.
No, you don't. I think it's nice that she's finally getting some recognition.
For sure. She's got a voice on her. Ice Moon is still in my top 10 favorite songs right now.
And that dropped forever ago.
Yeah, but it's classic. So is Babylon.
See, I like that track more without the Kendrick Lamar verse. I think it cuts into her flow.
I don't think you'll get anyone to agree with you on that, man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man what happened to Three Six Mafia?
They are still around, just individually.
Juicy J is one crazy fool.
Yes, he's had many hits such as his classic "Suck a.."
Ok, I get the point.  He's vulgar, but people love it.
He has made more money than the others who were part of the loose collective know as Hypnotize Minds.
Did you happen to like Project Pat?
Oh yeah, when Pat comes on, everyone loses it.
I agree.  It's like people know every word when they are fans.
Yes, I have met Project Pat fans from all over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Vince Staples's new album was released today, have you heard it?
Yeah, I listened to it this morning.
What'd you think about it?
It's interesting. It's a new sound for him, not what I expected.
I think it's a bold move to go for an unconventional sound.
It was okay, I just expected a more traditional hip-hop sound.
I liked the second track on the album, "Big Fish".
That's the most hip-hop sounding track. I like "SAMO" the drums are heavy on that track.
It's been getting good reviews. I give it an 8 out of 10.
I'd go for a 7 but I can't argue against an 8.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Bam Bam Carter?
OMG. So awful. I loved his music. I'm a big rap and hip-hop fanatic.
Who else do you like?
I'm kind of into DJ Khaled right now.
Me too. I like "Wild Thoughts" with Rihanna.
That's a great track. I love "Glow Up" and "I'm the One".
I heard "Wild Thoughts" is number-one in the UK right now.
Cool. What do you think of Chance the Rapper?
I love Chance the Rapper.
I think DJ Khaled and Chance the Rapper have collaborated on some songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Are you a fan of rap?
Yeah I would say so.
Who is your favorite Emcee?
I would have to go with Eminem.
I love some of his rhymes.
They are great.
Also, he's rhymes are so different.
Yeah stuff you'd never heard before he came along.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which rap artist would you like to see collaborate with Bruno Mars?
I hope to see Mase on a track with him someday.  Don't you think?
That would be cool.  I remember he use to work with artists like Brandy and Mariah Carey.   Did he mostly collaborate with women?
Yeah, he usually rapped on women's records.  But he had some great songs with Puff Daddy.  Do you remember those from the 90's?
Heck yeah!  My favorite was 'Mo Money Mo Problems.'  What about you?
Great choice.  I'd have to go with the 'Only You' remix.
Oh, how I miss the Shiny Suit days!
Seriously.  Some of the outfits they wore in those music videos were pretty sweet!
Yeah it's too bad artists don't make many music videos anymore.  When's the last time you've seen a rap music video on television?
Does youtube.com count?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How would you rank Kanye West's albums?
Off the top of my head, I still think that College Dropout remains his greatest work.
Better than Late Registration?
I'd say so. Late Registration is good, but too top heavy. Aside from Diamonds from Sierra Leone and Gold Digger, the songs range between average and good.
Yeah, but College Dropout is also top heavy in terms of hits.
I disagree. While the album has tons of hits like Jesus Walks, Slow Jamz, and All Falls Down, the best songs on the album are the deep tracks like We Don't Care and Last Call.
Last Call is weird because it's a 3 minute song followed by 10 minute monologue.
Yeah, but it's interesting to hear Kanye talk about how he was able to get a record deal as a producer.
I'll have to listen to that track again. Anyways, what do you think of his newer work?
It's great. Life of Pablo is a well crafted album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the current state of rap music?
It's very popular, but it all seems like it's the same kind of songs.
It doesn't seem like the average listener should relate to the content, most of them rap about making lots of money and driving fancy cars.
Yeah, rappers like Tupac, and even others like Dr. Dre really rapped about stuff that told the listener what they experienced.
Yeah, a golden era in rap for sure. There were a lot of songs about butts, though.
Nothing wrong with that! Rump Shaker was always a classic.
Yup. Sometimes I'd wish some of these current guys would sing about it without being so degrading and nasty.
It sells, though. Current rap always seems to hit it big on the charts.
I wonder if there's any good underground hip hop artists looking for a break.
There's plenty! You just have to know where to look.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I honestly feel like Eminem is a walking symbol of drama.
Why do you say that?
He's always writing about how much he loves his daughters, but goes off to abuse his wife and take sleeping pills.
Are you aware that he's been sober for a long time now?
What? When did that happen?
He has a song called "Not Afraid" where he tells all of his fans how thankful he is for them, and tells them that he vows to break that dangerous lifestyle.
Wow. That's admirable.
You're probably thinking about his earlier work.
Maybe. I'm just so used to him being profane and lambasting his wife and mother.
That's all part of his "Slim Shady" persona.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I truly believe that Kendrick Lamar's "Good Kid, M.a.a.d. City" is the best rap album of this generation.
I've always heard good things about his music.
He deserves all the praise he gets. He's fantastic.
What are some good songs off of that album?
My personal favorite is "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst".
That sounds deep by the title alone.
It is. It's over 10 minutes long, and the flow, lyrics, and beat are all very thoughtful.
Over 10 minutes? I don't think I've ever heard of such a song.
Well, Kendrick did it, and he did it wonderfully.
I'll definitely have to check that out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would Biggie still be relevant if he was alive today?
I doubt he would be.
But his style was so good.
I dont think he would be able to survive the lyrics.
What do you mean?
His lyrics wouldnt be able to hold up
He would be able to freestyle?
Yeah but thats something thats not hard to do.
Professionals are pretty good at it
Yeah and he lends himself to being able to do it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Public Enemy?
The are the greatest. Flavor Flav is the man?
What about female rappers? Who do you listen to?
Missy Elliott is a goddess. I love Lil' Kim as well. What about you?
Salt n' Pepa is the best.
They really are.
Do you think that rap lyrics are responsible for gun violence?
Not at all. They are just words, that's all.
Do you like newer rappers like Drake?
Not really, but I love Boosy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Twista?
Is that the rapper that raps fast?
It is! His flow is incredible.
He was featured on the song "Slow Jamz," wasn't he?
He was! Do you think he is the fastest rapper in the world?
It is quite possible. I wonder if there is a world record for rapping.
If there is, I bet he holds it.
Do you know any other rappers that are incredibly fast?
Busta Rhymes and Watsky also have an incredibly fast flow.
Good to know! I will have to check out too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen SUPER BASS by Nicki Minaj?
She's touching on that man.
And he is all muscle.
And she touches his scalp.
It is a happy song.
She wears those tiny shorts.
They are booty shorts.
What was that pink stuff in the drink?
I don't know.
But she was having fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is the best female rapper of all time?
it is Nicki Minaj
Well Remy ma is also one good rapper
Cardi B is also good but i think its nicki
why do you think its nicki?
she has this uplifting spirit when she raps
all rappers have  that kind of spirit
Nicki's its like the happiness during summer
well i guess you are right
yes and you are right too,all rappers have a spirit when they rap
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember MC Paul Barman?
Yeah, I used to listen to him when I was a teenager.
What was your favorite song of his?
I loved "Anarchist Bookstore Part 1."
That's a great song. So is "Anarchist Bookstore Part 2" by the way.
I also like "Talking Time Travel." I found that song very amusing.
Did you know that Questlove says Paul Barman is one of his top five rappers of all time?
Seriously? That's pretty crazy.
I know, I couldn't believe it when I heard him say that.
Well, Paul Barman is definitely very unique. You have to give him that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any rap lately?
Yeah I have been listening to Jay-Z.
How do you like his music?
I love it because it is so classic.
What is your favorite album.
I absolutely love the Blueprint.
I love that Hardknock life song.
The one like Annie?
Yes that one.
Oh yeah that one is amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when Eminem first came out?
Of course! I was a huge fan and still am.
I remember how different his song "The real Slim Shady" was. So weird.
It was definitely different.
He was like a brand new rapper though. His music was so different.
Yes! I still listen to his music today.
I do too at times.
I also enjoyed his movie "8 Mile".
Wasn't that based on his actual life?
Yes I believe it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any good rap albums lately?
Kendrick Lamar's latest album is spectacular.
Really? I haven't listened to it yet.
What are you waiting for!? You need to hear it!
What makes it so special?
Every song is very well-executed. There isn't a weak song on the whole album.
Is it as good as his previous album?
Yes, but it's much different. The new album is leaner and more focused.
I'll have to check it out then.
Yes, please do. I think it might be even better than "To Pimp a Butterfly" in some ways.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like ole school, i think it's cool.
yeah  my dad was a big fan of it.
Oh yeah who was some of his favorite artist back in the days
He use to listen to nas alot and he love snoop dogg.
Oh snap snoop dogg is one of the ole school greats.
yeah i listen to him alot right now.
i have a few snoop dogg cd's in my album collection also
yeah there's so many good rappers it's hard to name a number one.
think i'll go get a copy of that new snoop sound track.
Oh yeah let me know how good it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Eminem is the best rapper ever.
How so?
He can spit anything and people love it.
True.
Plus his raps are about real shit.
Also true.
He says things other people would be scared to say.
I know.
And it's funny because it's Eminem.
Eminem does go hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Turn down that c-rap!
Oh, come on! Just listen to the lyrics. They're really good!
You're telling me you can hear what he's saying through all that noise?
I can put the lyrics on the screen if it helps.
Fine, you get one song. Then play some real music.
My favorite part's "He says I love you okay? And then shoves it into her arm and says how the fuck does that taste, baby?"
That's your favorite part?
Yes, but all of MGK's lyrics are good.
That's horrible.
I know, that's what's so good about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are your top 5 favorite rappers of all time?
Kanye, Drake, Tupac, Nas and Kendrick Lamar and if I had to add one more person I would add Chuck D of Public Enemy.
while, I think we have the same taste.  I would just throw Biggie in there in place of Drake.  Drake is in my top 10, but not my top 5.
Who are your top 5 female rappers of all time?
Lauren Hill, Little Kim, Foxy Brown, Remy Ma and The Real Roxanne...lol..
ok I agree, but I also love Queen Latifah, Salt and Peppa and Nicki Minaj.
So are any of the ladies in your top 5?
Yes, Laura Hill, she was so great she was so smooth.   She could sing and rap, she was one of the greatest rappers period.
I agree, I got back and listen to her old stuff all the time, she was pretty impressive and could hold her own among these male rappers.
I would love to see something with Lauren Hill and Kendrick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder why snoop and dre never just kept up the two person act
Eh?
Well at one time they performed together as one act writing music
I would not know
Just curios i guess
Well i mean their has to be a reason
Well yeah
Prolly has to do with creative freedom
I guess it is harder to make what you want unless your alone
Pretty much it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What music group in Drake in?
Drake is signed to cash money/young money.
Who is the leader of young money?
Lil wayne is the leader of young money.
Do you like lil wayne as a rapper?
Yes, I really love how he helps other artists in their career.
I agree, lil wayne has helped Drake and Nicki in their career.
Who else is in Young Money
I think Tyga and lil twist are in young money.
That is right, I forgot about them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Lil Uzi Vert should be considered a rapper?
I'm not too sure. His beats are dope, but the bars are lackluster
Ok, true. But it's 2017, not 96 Reasonable Doubt era...
I agree... however quality is key.
And do you think his music isn't high quality?
Take someone new like Joey Badass and compare him to Uzi. It's high quality versus low-end rap.
But Uzi provides that vibe that you need sometimes...
Ehh... quality and a vibe is better than just a vibe.
Ok, I see what you mean.
...but regardless, if you like him, you like him. I can't judge!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the most influential rapper today?
I would have to say Drake?
Why did you choose Drake?
I think Drake because he has a rare talent of singing and rapping.
True, how about Kendrick Lamar?
He is great as well.
Which would you choose Kendrick Lamar or Drake?
Overall I like Drake better because he brings more to the table.
I like Kendrick Lamar on strictly rapping, he is better.
I will have to agree with you on that one, however both are great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could see one legendary rapper live, who would it be?
Snoop Dogg?
Really?
Yes
I thought you would have picked Eminem
I love him. But, I think Snoop Dogg is the best of all time
I like his stuff too.
Maybe they could do a show together
That would be awesome
I would pay extra to see them perform together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how do you like rap music?
I love it, Snoop Dog is the best to ever do it.
Really? I would take a lot of other rappers over him.
I love his style, who do you think is better?
I would say Tupac, Eminem, and Jay Z just to name a few.
They are all talented, but Snoop can flow like nobody else.
Have you ever listened to Eminem's tracks?
I recently heard Lose Yourself. That was a good song.
Yea that one always gets me pumped.
I would love to see him spin something with Snoop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about Drake?
I think he's cool and one of my friend's mimicing his hair style as well, haha
can't deny that's a fashionable hair style
yeah, do you like him? What's your favorite song from him?
yeah, I do. I actually listen to his music a lot this summer, what was that song that has Drake dancing in a light cube?
you mean Hotline Bling?
oh yes! it's an addictive song, and the music video is even more addictive
you mean those mock up videos that were created after the original one?
haha, exactly
I couldn't stop watching them either, so hilarious
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Eminem?
Yes he is a really good artist
I think i have all his cds
I used too
I loved his movie
8 mile?
Yes thats the one
It was a good movie
He is very talented
Yes he is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i really can't wait for Denzel Curry to drop Taboo.
Yeah, I really feel like Curry has a 10/10 album in him. He's got talent.
Judging from the demos he's put out, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that Taboo could fit that bill.
They're all so good and what is most impressive to me, is he's managed to maintain a fresh sound.
He's come such a long way from Nostalgic 64.
Did you know began rapping in the sixth grade?
No, I had no idea. Wow, that's young.
Well, he was only 16 when he released his first mixtape.
I know he joined Raider Klan when he was young, I didn't know he was that young.
He's definitely going to go far in the rap world. He's so talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think of that new Young Thug album "Beautiful Thugger Girls"?
I freaking loved it! I think it was his best yet. What did you think?
I liked it but it's not my favorite of his.
What's your favorite Young Thug album or mixtape?
Mine is still "Barter 6".
Ah, that is my second favorite by him. Did you happen to listen to the new 2 Chainz album too?
Yeah! I really like that one. "Good Drank" was my favorite song and "Riverdale Rd" was my second favorite.
I really wasn't feeling it all that much. I thought the lows were pretty low.
Yeah, I can see that. By the way, check out Let Me Breath by Action Bronson when you get a chance. That joint is fire.
Ok, I'm always down for some new Bronson. Can't wait for that Blue Chips 7000.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new album by the infamous Drake?
Yes! 'More to Life' is at the top of the charts! I love it!
I think it's one of his best ones yet.
I agree, it's so diverse and he even collaborated with Black Coffee in that one song!
Are you talking about 'Get It Together'?
Yes that one! With Jorja Smith as well.  It's a really great hit.
Drake always comes through. Let's talk about Chance The Rapper!
My man! He is beyond amazing.  I love his new album, 'Coloring Book.'
Me too. I especially like the song 'Smoke Break' with Future.
That collaboration is awesome! I am loving his entire album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Kanye go down as the best?
Late Registration as a great album
Things fell off around 808 and Heartbreak
The album was a departure from rap.
Right so it sounded silly.
I agree that he should have kept his focus around rap.
His personality wont be forgotten.
How about his legacy?
Might be that of a whiner.
Sure thats not what rappers get into the game for either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Ludocris music?
Yep-My favorite cd was "Rappers Delight".
Man-that is going way back to 1979. I like more of his modern songs.
Like what?
Remember when Tiger Woods was caught cheating and Luda rapped about it.
That was so cool. I forgot about it.
He really is not a bad actor. I like him in the "Fast and Furious" movies.
I do too! I always look forward to seeing those movies in the theater.
Do you own the Ludaversal cd and if you do can I borrow it.
No I don't sorry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
snoop dogg is the goat of rap to me
for sure hes been around for a long time
and he never changed from then to now
true i actually like the now snoop better
why would you say that
to me now hes a mega star that can go any where
yeah every one knows snoop
yeah he even has shows with martha stewart
snoop is number 1
no doubt
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Angel Haze?
Yeah I think they're a really talented actor and singer.
Yeah it's really cool too that they're out as trans.
Yeah and I can relate to their music about being a survivor.
Do you have a favorite song?
I like Battle Cry a lot.
Oh that's a good one! I like Black Dahlia.
Nice choice! That ones really meaningful.
Yeah I like how she talks about the complications of having an abusive mother.
Yeah she does a really good job talking about how complicated loving someone who has hurt you can be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wished rap music could be like it used to be.
I agree, it seems so watered down these days.
I used to love Bone Thugs And Harmony.
I did to, they had some great songs.
What was your favorite song of theirs?
I would have to go with Crossroads.
I used to listen to that song all the time.
What about you? Did you listen to any of their other songs?
Yes, I used to love First Of The Month.
Yea, they do not make rap music like that anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Kanye West is so overrated.
No way, Kanye is a lyrical genius.
You sound like Kanye.
Come on I'm serious. His music is original and his songs have a lot of meaning behind them.
What meaning does Gold Digger have behind it?
That some women are gold diggers!
That's so common and predictable though.
Maybe, but he wrote a catchy tune with interesting lyrics to get the point across.
I'll agree that it's catchy, but I'd hardly call it interesting.
It's a success for a reason!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How hard do you think it would be to rap about the Eiffel Tower?
Thats kind of ambigious.
Yeah but Kanye did it.
Rappers can talk about whatever they want.
Yeah how would you know though?
It comes through in their themes.
Then you get caucasian rappers talking about nonsense.
Everything has a meaning to it.
Like what Sage Francis talks about?
Yeah like how he touches on a ton of different subjects.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the difference between Hip Hop and Rap Music?
Well Hip Hop is from back in the days like the 90s and rap is the new stuff.
Well Rap developed from Hip Hop. Gangster rap started around the early 90's. As were Hip Hop deals with the 5 elements.
What are the 5 elements!?
The 5 elements are how Hip Hop was developed. You needed your DJ (disc jockey) and during his time is when DJ's became DJ's and began to scratch records. The Break dancers. The graffiti artists. The EmCee (mc) which is the rapper beatboxing.
Who are the top rappers from the 90s then?
I don't really see it that way but there is an order to how everyone has contributed to hip hop. People will automatically say Tupac and Biggie but KRS1 opened doors for knowlegde to be rapped about. LL cool J was or first FLASHY rapper with big chains and excessive women.
Ok so who is your favorite rapper?
I like many rappers for many reasons. Some give me knowledge, hope and drive others help me have a good time and never forget where Im from. Im a big NAS fan.
I like Nas too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's your favourite style or artist when it comes to rap music?
That's tough. I gotta say Class A'z, which are an irish rap collective, and everything that makes Irish rap distinctive.
What do you mean? What could make them distinctive, rapping about shamrocks?
No, I mean, you get used to some of the same rhymes and word combinations repeated over American rap lyrics but since the Irish have several distint accents, that opens up a lot more opportunity for making interesting rhymes with words you never would've thought of.
I never thought of that. Is that the only thing that sets them apart?
Well I find for me personally, the lyrics are much easier to make out and the flow is smoother, almost more polished. But you'll find the themes of the songs are not that much different from what you'll find in American rap.
You mean women, inebriation and money?
No, more like social justice, minority issues and deep life questions.
That's cool. I'll definitely give those artists a listen, thanks.
No problem!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seriously never heard of Public Enemy?
No man, I don't think so.
They're like one of the most popular rap groups of all time!
Oh, rap is young people music.
Almost a third of their studio albums are older than me, that's not exactly young.
You really like them?
Yeah I mean, I have their song Can't Truss It stuck in my head right now.
You should introduce me to them sometime.
Yeah definitely. I think we can skip their album It Takes a Nation but a couple of my favourite albums of theirs are Yo Bum Rush the Show and Fear of a Black Planet.
Sounds good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listent to rap music?
Yeah, all the time. It gets me pumped.
Yeah, I like it a lot too. Who do you like?
I mostly like earlier artists, like Dr. Dre, Snoop dogg, tupac, notorious big, nas, a tribe called quest. I like Eminem too, but he's a little more recent.
Oh yeah, I like all of those artists. I noticed there seem to be a lot of talented and unique acts out there now.
Yeah, there seems to have been a bit of an increase in unique rappers lately that can spit game.
It almost seems like a wave of indie rappers who are also commercially successful. Like Migos, Flatbush Zombies, Lil Uzi Vert, Logic, and Future.
Yeah, I can see that. I haven't heard of all the ones you listed, but I do recognize and like some of the rappers you said.
I could be wrong, but it seems like Youtube has played a huge role in the popularity of up and coming rappers.
Yeah, there are a lot of artists that get a lot of free exposure from Youtube. There's a number of rappers I would never have heard of if it wasn't for the videos on youtube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who Stromae is?
No, I've never heard of him.
He's a French guy. A rapper. You should check him out.
How'd you find out about this guy?
I had a French teacher who was into him. He's huge in France. Honestly, though, people are starting to catch onto him here.
Huh. Does he have videos and stuff?
Oh, yeah. I mean, they're high production and everything. The US isn't the only place for good music, man.
I know! I just never heard of him, is all.
You gotta get out in the world. Go to college or something.
Yeah, I know. Stromae. I'll check him out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the new Drake album?
I like it a lot, it's on my daily playlist still.
I think I like his mixtapes over actual albums, but I think it was pretty good too.
What's your favorite Drake record?
If You're Reading This It's Too Late.
I remember when that came out, I couldn't stop listening to it.
I like it when he collaborates with other artists on songs, which usually comes on mixtapes.
Yeah, I love when I hear Lil Wayne on a track with Drake.
Or Future!
Agreed, I feel like all the best Drake songs have features on them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm a proud Latinx. Since I'm not black, I always think there is no place for me in rap music.
There are many Latinx rap and hip hop artists.
Are any of them good and well respected in the rap industry?
You must have heard of Fat Joe.
Who is he again? Did he sing any songs I know?
He had a huge song 10 year's ago called "Lean Back"
I remember that song! There was a dance with it, right?
Yes exactly. Just last year he also had a big song called "All the way up"
That was one of my favorite songs of the summer! Kudos to him for being the first great Latinx rapper.
He wasn't the first great Latinx rapper. Another Puerto Rican / New Yorker called Big Pun was a legend before him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Eminem is probably one of the best rappers of all time
I would hate to argue that
Yeah you are right he schemed like no one else.
he could rhyme anything together.
Yeah he could out freestyle you too.
His diss tracks made sense.
you didnt want to go at him
we are talking like hes dead
his career has been
ouch, you are right though
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love ja rules put it on me song
From his album RULE 3:36
Yes thats the one
I like it too
I also really like the mesmorize song
Thats the one where he does a grease scene in his video
Yes
I love that, that has always been my favorite
Mine too
It was so cool how he did that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that one song "Work It" from the early 2000s?
I do but I'm having a hard time placing the artist, do you know?
It was by Missy Elliot.
Right I loved her music.
Right? All of her music videos were so cool.
She was very original.
I thought it was cute how she had kids dancing in her videos.
Yes, one little girl was in quite a few of them.
I think I know who you mean. I don't remember her name.
Me either but she was Caucasian and a great dancer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you hear that new rap song?
No, I have taste in music and don't listen to rap.
Why not? Rap and hip/hop are the voice of oppressed people.
When all of the music turns positive, stops demeaning women, other blacks, and quits making up social issues to talk about, I'll consider it.
If you just listen to the lyrics, you'll come away with a much better understanding. The lyrics are deep.
Please. I could put Dr. Seuss's "Green Eggs and Ham" to a rap beat and have a platinum selling album.
You know what it says about you if you don't like rap and hip hop?
Yeah, like I said before, it means I have a good taste in music.
Whatever.
Thanks. Try listening to some Rush. THOSE are deep lyrics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any of Schoolboy Q's new music?
Yeah. His newest album is pretty good.
What was that one called, again?
"Blank Face" was the name of it.
Oh yeah. That's my favorite by him so far.
It had some of those old-school type of beats on it.
Yeah, I'm really into stuff like that.
It was cool how he did the extended video releases on Youtube with the album.
Those were fun to watch. I loved the one that featured the song "Tookie Knows pt. II"
That has to be one of the best songs on the whole album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Prodigy died?
Oh, that's so said!  I'll have to drink a Guiness to him.
I loved Mobb Depp! One of my favorite groups.
Yeah, that and Black Star.
Did you know that Nas inspired his lyrics.
No, but that doesn't suprise me.  They are both super deep.
I think Infamous was their best album.
Yeah, it's great.  But I like Hell on Earth better.
Did you like Infamy?
Hey man, it's better than no Mobb Depp at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever heard of J. Cole?
The rapper? Yeah, but I'm not a fan.
Why not?
I heard his song "Work Out", and just didn't like it at all.
Don't let that one song influence your opinion of all his music.
Why? Is it different from that song?
Vastly different. He's actually very lyrical, almost like Tupac.
That's a very bold claim.
I can back it up. Listen to "Change" and "High for Hours". You'll understand.
I better not be disappointed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went to the club the other night and guess what song came on?
I think I already know what you're going to say, but Back That Azz Up??
Haha yeah, honestly every time I go out I hear that song being played at least 5-6 times.
By far the greatest song Juvenile ever put out. It just flows, perfect for playing in a club. The girls go wild when they hear it.
Girls aren't the only ones that go wild when it's played, I get loose as soon as that iconic beat drops!
I'm listenig to it rite now! I wouldn't call it Juvenile's greatest song though.
Ok I'm game, what's Juvenile's greatest song then?
Slow Motion is the best Juvenile song in my opinion. It's just as iconic as Back That Azz Up but Juvenile collaborated with Souja Slim for Slow Motion.
I always forget Souja Slim was part of Slow Motion, I wish he was still alive, the music he made was top of the line.
Yeah, it's ashame he was killed but I guess that shows you how gangsta he really was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The 90's had some pretty decent mainstream rap...
Yeah, I LOVED Blacksheep.  Remember their album A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing?
Oh yeah!  That one had U Mean I'm Not and This or That, right?
Ha ha ha!!  Yes!  U Mean I'm Not was hilarious - parody, satire, I guess it could be classified...
How about someone like Eminem, though?
I mean, he was mainstream, kind of...but maybe got too hot to handle later on...
His thing turned into like a soap opera...
Yeah, like it wasn't so much about his artwork, but his personal life supposedly got dragged into everything.  Whole tracks were dedicated to family members, etc.
Yeah, but he sure as all get-out was fascinating to watch and listen to.  Just couldn't help myself.
Neither could I...  Need to see what Eminem's up to now...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the diss song about Nicki Minaj ?
Yes Remy Ma went really hard on her.
Nicki Minaj made a song about Remy ma do you know who was on the track with her?
I think it was Drake and Lil Wayne.
I think it was good but she needed help from them.
Yeah Remy ma didn't need any help she went hard by herself.
I think Remy ma's song was the best diss song in a long time.
Yes I do too she wasn't playing no games.
I think Remy handled herself  like a real boss.
I think without help from Lil Wayne and Drake No frauds would have been a loss.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Biggie or Tupac more?
I have to go with Tupac but honestly I don't listen to much of either.
Yeah, I liked his west coast style a little bit more.
I have to give them both respect, though. They were ahead of their time.
Definitely. They are legends now.
I wonder if a lot of the east coast versus west coast rap drama was real.
Well, they did made diss tracks about each other.
True, but I think some of that was for publicity.
Yeah I doubt people really cared that much which coast their rap music came from.
Exactly, I think it was just the rappers involved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Jay-Z was dropping a new album?
No way i had no clue. What's it called?
4:44
Really? I been seeing ads for it all over the city but it didn't say what it was for.
I guess that was all apart of the marketing plan just to get people to look into it.
I hope this album is worth listen to. I want that old Jay-Z back.
Yeah i want that Reasonable Doubt, Blueprint, Black Album Jay-Z.
Just because it's Jay-Z it's gonna sell big time.
I think the only way to get it is through Tidal.
That's until the internet gets a hold of it then it'll be everywhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best era for rap/hip hop music?
I'd probably have to say mid 90's.
Oh, good choice.
Yea. I feel like during that era was really a golden age for rap.
Totally. It's like rap was so new and amateur in the 80's, but during the 90's rappers were really perfecting and modernizing hip hop to what it is today.
Yea, I think that probably some of the most influential rap artists came about in the 90's.
Oh for sure. Tupac, Biggie, Redman, Lauryn Hill, Snoop Dog and Nas to name a few.
Yea, those artists totally paved the way for what hip hop is today.
They owe a lot to those "forefathers" of hip hop.
That's for sure. Such a good era...I wish I could go back and relive those days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that new Tupac biopic?
Nah, I don't really have much interest in seeing that.
Really? Why not?
I was never a huge Tupac fan. I think he's quite overrated.
Well of course he's a bit overrated. That's to be expected.
What do you mean?
His life has gotten turned into a myth. If he were still alive people would view him much differently.
Yeah, that's very true. And I think the same goes for Biggie.
Yep. They're both very good, but not the greatest of all time.
Well, if I had to choose between the two I would take Biggie every time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any rappers lately?
I like listening to Kanye West.
I like Kanye too.
Have you heard his latest album?
Yes. I like listening to Real Friends.
Same.
The best album however is the Graduation album.
I love the song Flashing Lights on that.
Me too. I also like Stronger.
Also a very good song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been hearing any rap music lately?
Yes I have been listening to Big Boi.
Awesome. What songs?
Mic Jack and Da Next Day.
On the Boomiverse album?
Yeah that is exactly right?
The only song I have is In the South.
I like that song with Gucci Mane.
They both are talented.
I always feel they are catchy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which region of hip hop makes the best music?
I think the south atlanta especially
Why do you say that?
The south has been dominant since 2004. We 13 years into it. THat is longer then the east or west coast
Who is second?
It is close but east coast. It started there. THe best mc's are from there. Even now people know jayz
Do you count canada?
No canada only has drake
What is the future of hiphop?
I think it would go from southern city to southern city. Atlanta, to houston to miami
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Run-DMC song?
I like My Adidas.
That's a good one. Do you like Run's House?
I love that song. I also like Krush Groove.
Which one is that?
They made a movie back in the eighties called Krush Groove. It was the song they did at the end.
You mean the one with Sheila E, The Fat Boys, and Kurtis Blow?
Yeah that's the one. The verse Run-DMC did on there was sick.
I wonder what ever happened to The Fat Boys?
I think one of them died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you listen to a lot of rap?
I wouldn't say a lot, but I do listen to some.
Who do you like?
Rapper wise?
Yeah.
Drake is pretty good.
Yeah sure he's not bad.
I can listen to a few of his songs and not hate it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best female rapper of all time?
I really like Missy Elliot.  She was really incredible to listen to.
What about Nicki Minaj?
She's talented, but I don't think she's as good as Missy by far.
Does Missy Elliot still make music?
I think she released a new album within the last year.
Oh, I hadn't realized that.
Yeah, I guess she's not as popular as she used to be.
She really was on fire back in the day.
Oh, yeah, she was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i heard doctor dre sold beats.
yeah he sold them to apple.
has he came out with any new music?
i think so i'm going to the store to pick up some new cd's

lol, there a few i need to pick up.
yeah rap is a great way to clean the house
i lesten to nas when i cleaning he's so cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, if you have to choose: Notorious B.I.G. or Tupac?
Definitely Tupac.
What? I can't believe that. Why?
California Love and Changes are amazing songs.
I mean that's true.
Who would you pick?
Definitely Notorious B.I.G. I love Juicy and Hypnotize.
That's true. He has some great hits as well.
Okay, but can we agree that East Coast or West Coast, Snoop Doggy Dogg is an amazing 90s rapper?
Oh yeah, I could listen to Gin and Juice all day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to rap music at all?
Sometimes I do. Depends on my mood.
You're right. Sometimes I'm in the mood for other music myself.
Who's your favorite artist when you do listen to rap music?
I'm not exactly sure but I do love but I do like Jay Z a little bit.
Yea I like him too! Good rapper.
Which of his songs do you like the best?
I think "99 problems" is one of the ones I like best. It's a pretty great song.
I know that one! It's pretty good.
I like "Dirt off Your Shoulder" also.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the biggest fake rap artist of all time?
Are you serious? The Van Winkle fellow Mr. Vanilla Ice.
He's one heck of a contractor and carpenter though.
You are right about that. I'm sure the dude always knew that he was going to need a plan B.
Why did he tell everyone that he was from Miami? Did he think he was being cool?
I don't know. The dude's from Lewisville, Tx........and no knock on Lewisville but there are lots of guys there that are just like him.
He should have just rapped about Dallas. Dallas is a really cool town.
That's what I'm saying, but I guess he thought Miami was a cooler look or something.
Was Ice Ice Baby his only hit?
Most definitely, and I guarantee you he has performed that song like at least 20,000 times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite female R&B singer?
I love Jhene Aiko. Do you know her?
Wasn't she the one who sang "The Worst?"
Yes, I love that song because it is so relaxing. I love the album "Sail Out" where that song comes from.
What song do you like from that album?
I love "Bed Peace." Childish Gambino is in that song.
What do you like about that song?
The song is for light listening even though some of the lyrics is for adult.
What do you mean? Can you explain?
Well, why don't you just listen for yourself? Haha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper from New York?
I would say Jay-z.
Why Jay-z.
I believe that he is the most lyrical and he has done the most for the culture.
What do you mean 'for the culture'?
Jay-z had broken down barriers and branched out of just hip hop. He is a mainstream mogul now.
I agree, he had done more than he probably ever thought he would.
Yes, and he has a new album coming out soon.
What is the name of the album.
The name is '4:44'.
XXXXXXXXXXX
ice tee got a new comercial
yeah i seen that with geico
yeah he's a very good rap artist
it's a very cool comercial
yeah i like him he's a good rapper
me to he hasnt came out with anything new
i think he's just doing movies and tv shows
i wish he would make some new music.
me to he still can rap
i would buy his cd in a heart beat if he made something new.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you like better, the old Kanye, or the new Kanye?
The old Kanye, hand's down. The College Dropout and Graduation are classics.
I completely agree, I'm still in awe at how amazing 'Through the Wire' was. He rapped that with his jaw wired shut!
Right? And honestly I still listen to 'The New Workout Plan' every time I go for a run.
So did you not like his new stuff at all?
Oh no, I just prefer the old Kanye, but I did really like 'Life of Pablo.'
I did too, and you know what's funny? The song 'I Love Kanye' where he raps 'I miss the old Kanye.'
Hahaha! 'I miss the old Kanye, straight from the go Kanye.'
'Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye.' But can we both agree 'Yeezus' was one of the worst albums of all time?
Oh I don't know about that ... I really liked BLKKK SKKKN HEAD.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's a lot of underrated rappers out there.
Totally. My vote for the most underrated rapper goes to Nas.
Wait. Since when is Nas underrated?
Well think about it. To a lot of people, the best rappers ever are Tupac, Biggie, and Eminem, right?
Right. So what?
Nas' "Illmatic" was one of the best albums of it's time, and no one seems to remember it.
That is true. That album is, in my opinion, the epitome of East coast rap.
It really is. He has the perfect voice for it.
And his flow is pretty much untouchable.
He just moves with the beat like nobody else. He's still untouched.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music?
Well, I don't listen to it very often, but some songs and artists I like.
Which artists do you like?
Nas, Jay Z, and Jadakiss.
Oh those are really great rappers.  Some of the best, actually.
Yeah, I only like decent rap.  None of this Lil Wayne stuff.
Why not Lil Wayne?
His music, like a lot of others, is exploitative.  It doesn't say anything, it's just random garble about guns and women and weed.  It promotes a poor outlook for black culture.
Wow, yeah I guess it does.
Rap should say something meaningful, not just talk about money all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lil Wayne?
I hate his new music but when Wayne was apart of the Hot Boyz his music was amazing!
Hot Boyz? I've never heard of that group before, who were they?
Are you kidding me? Cash Money Records dude! The group was and is the hottest hip hop group of all time.
Who else was in the group beside Lil Wayne?
The group was only New Orleans rappers specifically Juvenile, Turk, B.G., and Lil Wayne! I can't believe you've never heard of them before.
I've heard of Juvenile before but not B.G. and Turk.
Yeah well Juvenile is really the only former group member who still makes decent music. B.G. is serving like 20 year prison sentence for having illegal firearms and Turk was in prison for a long time but was released not too long ago.
That sucks. Do you think they'll ever have a reunion?
Lil Wayne tried to have one a few years ago at some show in New Orleans but only Juvenile, Turk, and Wayne perfromed. B.G. was already locked away in prison so I guess it was a semi reunion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer Biggie or Tupac?
I always think it's funny we feel like we have to pick. But that said - Tupac.
Me too. I just like his flow better.
He was more political in his lyrics than Biggie, too, which I always liked.
Me too, political rap is the best type.
They were both so talented though, and it feels stupid to 'pick' one.
It's because of the East Coast/West Coast thing, I guess. We all get caught up iun the rivalry.
Which is such a shame, since that's what killed him.
And he was so young. Who knows what he could've done with more time.
In my opinion he's already the greatest rapper ever, and that's with such a small discography. It really is sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Nicki Minaj?
I do not know many of her songs. Are you a fan?
I am. I think she is an excellent female rapper.
What is your favorite song by her?
Anaconda is my favorite song.
What does it sound like?
Actually, the song samples an older song by an artist called Sir Mix A Lot.
Interesting. Sampling is very popular in music nowadays.
I agree. I guess that artists think it provides multiple entry points for their music.
I definitely think that it does open their music to a new audience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up with Young Thug?
Idk man, he's basically become Lil Wayne 2.0
He looks downright drugged out in that Mamacita video
Yeah, seeing him flail around like that is weird
I did like Mamacita a lot
No doubt, that song is great.
Okay, what's your favorite Schoolboy Q track?
Gotta go with Collard Greens! Kendrick Lamar is so good on it
He does own that song. The beat to that track..
It's amazing. I still listen to that weekly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite underground rapper?
Yeah, I have a bunch. One of my recent favorites is a dude called Despot.
What song should I listen to by him?
"House of Bricks" is his big single. It goes hard.
Dope. I'm gonna add it to my playlist, who else do you like?
My all time favorite underground rap artist is Deltron 3030. He does sci-fi themed hip-hop that is super great.
I've heard of him, he goes by some other names too right?
Yeah, Del the Funkee Homosapien.
Yeah, I recognize that. My favorite underground hip hop artist also has multiple names: MF Doom, Viktor Vaughn, Madvillain, et cetera.
I completely forgot about him. He's one of the most agile lyricists to ever live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you feel like any rappers are overrated at all?
Well, I can definitely think of one.
Who would that be.
Jay Z. In my honest opinion he's the most overrated rapper in history.
Really? He's seen as one of the best.
But realistically, he's just average.
That's silly! How can you say that.
He barely has any flow and his lyrics are too all over the place. The only reason people put him on such a pedestal is because of his wife.
I still don't buy it.
You need to recognize average rap when you hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what enlivens real name is?
I've heard it before but i forgot
Marshall Bruce Mathers III
That's a mouthful
It is
I wonder where he got eminem from
Me too
It's a good name though
Yes it is
It fits him
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you know about 90s rap?
I think it was a lot better than the rap from 2017
Why do you say that?
Rapper used to be gangster and their lyrics were gangster too
But nowdays they arent?
No way. They used to wear clothes that were literally baggy but now they all wear Gucci and stuff
That's true, I never saw Tupac wearing Louis Vuitton. He rapped about the streets
I dont miss the east coast and west coast fighting though
Yeah, all the good rappers got caught up in that and some of them got killed
Biggie and Tupac should still be alive, but their raps were dissing each other and they got shot
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you still a rap fan?
Yes but not any of the new stuff. Classic hip hop all the way.
Why?
It's just not as good now, the lyrics are all the same, the MCs all dress the same.
I remember you used to love Eve, LLCool J, Dre
Yeah still do. Eve and Ja Rule were the bomb, they still tour
Have you been
Yep I say Ashanti, Eve, Ja Rule in Philly last year.
That's good, shame you don't like the quality now.
There's a really small few like Common that still have a message.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who's your favorite old school rapper?
Biggie smalls, dude had some sick flow
I liked Will Smith
Will Smith?!
Yeah haven't you heard of the Fresh Prince rap?
Duh!
So he's so famous he became a fantastic actor
eh good point
I also like Kendrick Lamar
He's dope too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, listen to any rap hip/hop lately?
Actually, I just got done watching the new video for XO TOUR Llif3 by Lil Uzi Vert.
Oh, what did you think?
The video is freaking WEIRD, man.  The whole is like a single gif picture of this guy (I presume the artist) driving in his car with a red and blue gradient pattern where the window would be.
A gif?  What do you mean?
Well, the whole thing is like a cartoon with just four or five frames of animation looped endlessly while he's singing. I think it's intentional badly drawn as part of the "style".
Oh, they call that "Stylistic Suck" on the TV Tropes website.
Oh, didn't know that.. haven't to look that up.  Anyway, I don't know, the song itself is okay, I guess.  I'm biased though, it's not really my type of music.
Well, to each is own.
Another thing that bugs me about the image though is they've got a badly drawn nose ring coming out of the guy's nostrils, but it looks to me like he's got a runny nose!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I do not like rap nowadays.
You are not a fan of the contemporary stuff at all?
No. I don't think it is very good
I hear you. The sound seems too artificial
Back in the day, it had a really organic sound
Yes and the rhymes were better
I think the raps made more sense too.
Yeah. Today they are pretty much all the same
At least we still have the oldies
They're always gonna be here
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rap music these days just isn't the same as it used to be.
I think it's still doing pretty good.
Maybe, but there's just no good rappers anymore.
Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole are the two best right now. Their music is both thoughtful and catchy.
Well, that's only two. I imagine it stops there.
You're wrong. Guys like Chance the Rapper, Tyler the Creator, and so much others are really good.
Okay, then. Go on.
Not to mention that legends like Nas, Eminem, and Ice Cube are still making music.
I didn't know they were still around.
You see? Don't get so stuck in the past, or you'll miss out on what's happening right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like I've been listening to the same hip hop songs over and over for the last couple months.
Out of necessity or no?
Well I mean they're all songs I really like, I just feel like I should freshen up my playlist a bit.
You can always use an app or website where you put in music that you like and it will suggest similar stuff.
The thing is I can't pinpoint what it is about the songs and artists that I like, and if I did I wouldn't know how to word it.
Understandable. Well tell me some of your favourite artists and see if we can find their similarities.
Off the top of my head, I like Trigger, Redzer and Terawrizt
Okay, so something that stands out is that they have a tendency to talk about some really serious stuff in a very laid back, almost casual way.
That sounds about right actually.
Then we're off to a good start! That's a couple of really solid aspects right there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you heard Chance the Rapper's new song with DJ Khaled?
Yeah, the one called "I Love You So Much"? Chance has a whole verse on it that is literally just the alphabet.
I know! That's what I was going to say! It's crazy, but it sounds good. That man can make anything flow good.
I hear that! I've been so happy to watch his career grow! Especially after his latest album, Coloring Book. Have you listened to it?
Yes, I have. It's such a different sound than his earlier work. I can't decide whether I like it or not.
You mean all the gospel stuff?
Yeah, it reminds me of being in church when I was little
I think that's the point he's trying to make! Haha
I guess so! His verses are still amazing though. And the features are great. I just kind of miss Acid Rap Chance.
Me too, but artists are humans too. They grow and evolve. Chance is a daddy now. He can't be doing acid all the time any more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, I'm bummed out cause I live with my parents and they won't allow me to listen to rap music.
Why not? It's not an inherently bad genre.
They're super conservative Chrstians and think it would be a bad influence or something. So unless there's Christian artists out there...
There actually are, like Tedashii, Lecrae, and Trip Lee just to name a few.
I wonder if that would be allowed.
I don't see why not. But really, secular rap isn't bad, it's just what you use it for that's bad.
Well I wouldn't let it influence me negatively anyway.
It really doesn't have any power to influence you as long as you approach it with the mindset of you have to be discerning with it, unless your heart is already in a bad place and you actively want that music to encourage or grow that stuff in you. And even then it's not the music that's the problem.
Mind if I plagiarize that and use that to explain to them?
Not a bit, I hope it helps.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How great was the Jay Z Kanye West group album.
I might be in the minority but I did not like it.
Why not?
I thought it was a bit pretentious.
In what manner?
They just both have huge egos.
Thats what made the album so good
The lyrics were a little awful just bragging about how rich they are.
Thats what rap is about though, you gotta go hard.
I can go hard but some of it was aimless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you listening to much rap these days?
Sometimes, though I usually play old school stuff from the 90s. I'm not that familiar with newer rappers.
90s rap is good, though there's some great stuff being released right now. You should check it out.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Try Kendrick Lamar. He's good.
Cool, who else?
Run the Jewels are excellent. Try their song "Oh My Darling, Don't Cry".
That doesn't sound like a rap song.
Trust me, it's a rap song, and it's very good.
Okay, I'll check it out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the best duo: Outkast or UGK?
I'd have to say UGK. They have that southern, raw, down home sound that is relateable on many levels.
Really? I'd say Outkast.
Why Outkast? They aren't even rapping together anymore.
UGK isn't rapping together either. But I like how down Outkast is for Atlanta, but they don't let their "donwness" stop them from getting their coins.
Are you saying that UGK is too down?
Bun B talked about it in The Story. He considered doing a Big Pimpin 2.
But they didn't make it.
That's because didn't want to seem like he sold out to his original fan base.
Well, UGK is still better than Outkast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm dying for the new Azealia Banks record to finally come out.
Do you think it'll be out anytime soon?
Well she keeps talking about it, but I'm not sure.
You know, she's missed more than one release date.
Exactly. I need somebody to distract me.
Well have you checked out Cakes da Killa?
Can't say that I have.
He's really good. You can get his three mixtapes for free, and he just dropped an album.
I'll check it out. I've been listening to a lot of Angel Haze to bide my time.
She's another really good one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the rap artist Yae Yae Jordan?
I think I have heard of him.
Hes got this really good song called One Time.
Isn't he affiliated with Cheef Keef?
Yeah, he is. Most of the guys who know him are crazy.
I heard Yae Yae Jordan actually went to prison for murder.
Jesus Christ what happened?
He was in a club and some guys insulted him.
Then what happened?
Apparently, he came back and shot up the entire club and killed 3 people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you say is the most influential rapper
In my opinion, it has to be Eminem
Really? Why him?
Well he broke so many boundries in his day
What does that have to do with his music though?
Well all of his struggles really show through in his flow and his lyrics
Yeah that makes sense. Can you recommend me an Eminem song?
White America has a pretty deep meaning
Wow i'll have a listen
Trust me, you'll be blown away by his flow
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you like Outkast?
I think they were very innovative
Did you like Speakerboxxx?
I thought it was OK.
I think the vocal harmonies on the album were top notch
Yeah Outkast always does a good job sounding clean.
My favorite though is Bombs over Baghdad.
That song alone is one of the best rap songs of all time.
Yeah I loved the chorus
It made you latch onto the track
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is 50 Cent a favorite rapper of yours?
No
But, do you like him?
I like some of his stuff.
But not all of it?
No. He does not have many great songs
I see what you mean. He's not like the greats
Yeah. Easy E and Eminem have tons of great songs
True. Don't forget about Notorious BIG
Of course. He is a legend
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Nappy Headed Roots?
Yeah they were a flash in the pan
I wonder if they still make music
Theres alot of one and done artists
That could be said for any genre.
Rap has them more than others.
Like Petey Pablo?
Joe Budden had one hit but hes big still
Yeah he does the podcast stuff
Not very credible for a street rapper
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider more of a fan of retro rap, such as back in the '90's, or today?
Honestly, somewhere in between. I am a bit more of a '90's person when it comes to rap, but I do like some of stuff from the 2000's.
Are particular favorite rapper you enjoy?
Actually, growing up, I was a big fan of Eminem. His music was always quite good, in my opinion.
He was definitely at his peak, I think in the early 2000's with the Marshal Mathers LP album.
To this day, I think that was his best album.
Oh definitely. What's your favorite song by Eminem?
That's a tough one. I am going to go a little outside the box and go with "Stan." I just really love the story the song told.
Could you refresh my memory on that song or better yet, the story?
Essentially, the verses are a crazed fan writing to Eminem, and as the song goes on, and we go into his second, and then third letter, he begins to lose it due to not getting a response.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Tupac?
I do! He is one of the best rappers in history
What is your favorite Tupac song?
"Dear Mama" is my favorite. It always makes me cry.
I love that one. But I also really like "Hail Mary"
I don't know that song. Would I like it?
I think you would! I really love the message behind it.
His lyrics were always so powerful.
It is such a shame that he is dead.
But fortunately his legacy lives on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man oh man, this beat is sick.
What beat, all I hear is gunshots.
Yeah! Its gangster rap!
Please, thats nothing like the classics.
What do you know about rap?
In the 90s I was all about that life. Tupac, Biggie, and the rest.
Really, a white guy like you?
I'm a gangster on the inside.
Better keep it there, weirdo.
Word up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Who is your favorite rapper?
I like Eminem.
He is an all time great.
Oh you like him too?
Yeah.
Why do you like him?
Man his lyrics are incredible.  Plus he doesn't sound like anyone else.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to Trick Daddy?
He was a one hit wonder.
No, he had more than one hit.
Really can you name one.
No I cant name any actually
So he was a one hit wonder?
Yeah I guess you could say that.
What about Lil wayne
He wasnt a one hit wonder
Yeah but his time as the ruler was short
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if Rick Ross is working on a new album?
I imagine so he doesn't really seem like the type to just stop all of the sudden.
Yeah he seems driven to be successful.
That's exactly right.
Any clue when a new album of his might come out then?
Hard to say really maybe another year?  He seems to work hard on them for awhile.
That's sad but at the same time it's worth the wait.
Yeah it is.
Wonder if he'll work with any other rappers on this album.
Maybe, hope it's eminem.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seed RIGHT BY MY SIDE?
It's by Nicki Minaj.
And Chris Brown is in it.
It was released i think in 2012 or so.
It had 331,000,000 views on YOUTUBE.
Chris has that big necklace.
And they kiss.
I liked the Bentley.
She always acts rich.
I like her teddy bear shirt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, would you like to hear some Snoop Dogg?
Yes. He is one of my favorite rappers.
Do you have any CD's he put out?
Yes. I loved his early work and also his later work.
Did you ever hear Doddystyle?
That is the first album I bought. I got it in 1993.
That was a great one.
Did you ever hear The Last Meal?
I did not. But, we can probably get it on Amazon.
Let's get Over the Counter too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
whta time does the too short concert start?
i think at about 9:30 tonight
cool i haven't seen him in person have you?
no not yet.
well i guess if your not doing any thing saturday we can go
i would go if i had some extra money how much is it.
i think it's $45 for a ticket
can you lone me the $45 till next week
yeah if you want to go to the concert i 'll pay for you no worries
gee thanks man i love the rap artist he's so cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the rapper "Eminem"?
Personally not such a fan. You?
I wouldn't call myself a super fan, but I do like some of his first hits.
Yea, I'd have to say that even I thought the song "The Real Slim Shady" was pretty catchy.
For sure. I also feel like even though I'm not a huge fan of his, I think he's really talented.
Yea. He probably had to try twice as hard to get respect and recognition in the hip hop community.
Why's that?
Well he is a white rapper in a predominately black ruled genre of music.
Oh yea, this is true. You can really see that play out in his movie "8 Mile".
Yea and that movie was pretty much an autobiography.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite artist right now?
My favorite artist is Migos. Who are your top three favorite artists?
I thought your favorite was Gucci man. I like Gucci but I am not sure who my other favorite artists are right now.
I like Gucci, but Migos is very good right now.
I like Migos right now but I think they are only going to be popular temporarily.
Migos is an extremely talented group, I think each artist is going to be very popular when they go solo, especially Takeoff.
You might be right, I think Takeoff is talented. Who are your other top artists right now?
I like Quavo.
Who is Quavo?
Quavo is part of Migos, that is my favorite group right now, artist one, two and three.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm such a big fan of J. Cole.
I've heard that he's one of the best rappers out there.
He is. He has such a great ability to combine thoughtful lyrics that tell a story with catchy beats.
Would you recommend any songs?
Sure thing. "A Tale of 2 Citiez" and "Deja Vu" are two great places to start.
I'll definitely check him out on YouTube.
He's also collaborated with Kendrick Lamar quite a bit.
Oh, really? On what.
They both freestyled over one of each other's songs. It's a great listen.
I'll look that up too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
whats some good rap music.
have you heard that new two chains
no is he a new rapper
yeah but he be out for a minute
when was his first cd released
i think it was around 2002
oh okay is his music good
compared to alot of rappers he rap good
oh snap i gotta go pick up a cd
yeah you won't regret it he's good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think rap is better today or back in the 90's
Definitely back in the 90's
I feel the same way, Like today rappers don't really say anything that has a lot of meaning or depth.
Exactly like Soulja Boy he is retarded. I can't believe he sold even one album.
Definitely and that song Pretty Boy Swag is not exactly Nas or Tupac.
Yeah these new rappers are really lame. I wonder if someone dropped on their by accident when they were a baby.
That's too funny. So who is your favorite new rapper out right now?
that would have meek mills
I love meek mills. He's from Philly
I'm from too home of the cheese steaks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you choose between Dr. Dre and Eminem?
I gotta go with Eminem
Really?
Yes. He has my favorite songs like My Name is
Do you like that real slim shady song too?
Yes
He is good. I love his stuff
Dr. Dre is great too.
Did you know they worked together?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
When do you think Snoop Dogg will make another album?
Well, I think I just read that he came out with a new song.
Oh, what's the name of it?
I don't remember, but it's controversial.
When isn't Snoop Dogg controversial?
Yeah, that's true, but this must have been bad enough for the media to pick up on.
What's controversial about it anyway?
I think it has to do about being homophobic or something.
Wow, that's an area that I wouldn't have expected him to touch.
Yeah, but he's getting publicity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the last time we got something from Kim?
Lil Kim? She just released a new mixtape.
No kidding? What's it called?
Lil Kim Season, but she also released Hardcore 2016.
Hardcore 2016? Does it sample her debut?
I mean, not really. It's kind of a tribute in name only.
Would you say they are worth checking out?
Honestly, no. The production on it is really rough.
But didn't she just hook up with Bad Boy again?
Yeah, but only on a short term basis, I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what Hip hop artist is the best in the game right now?
I would have to say Meek Mills.
Oh really ya think?
Yeah or maybe Drake.
Yeah Drake is alright just a bit corny.
Yeah too corny for my taste.
But I did like his last album.
Yeah that was really cool.
He did his thing on that.
Yeah that was hot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the most popular rap song in the country right now?
It is a song called "I'm The One"
Who sings that song?
DJ Khaled is the artist, but it has many featured vocalists.
Like who?
Chance The Rapper & Lil Wayne, as well as Justin Bieber.
Where did you hear that this was the most popular song?
I read it in Billboard.
I'll have to check this song out. It sounds really cool.
It's a huge hit. I think that you will really like it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Quick! Name your favorite modern rapper.
That is a tough one. I'd have to say Eminem.
Why is that?
He raps about stuff that is relevant and important.
Other rappers don't?
Some do, but most just rap about the same "gangsta" stuff over and over.
That is true.  Who else do you like, that raps about stuff like Eminem?
I really like Kendrick Lamar, and I loved Prodigy.
Sad news about Prodigy, he was great.
Yes, he will be missed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man I still cannot believe him
Who
Ice T he is like the man
Well he is pretty outward
He is a rap legend and he is a TV star
You know he has done more than  that
Like what
He is in a Rock band it is called body count
That sounds awesome
Well it is more Rock Rap but it is cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Nas or Jay-Z, who's the King of NY?
That was already settled man. They're friends no anyways.
It wasn't settled! People still disagree to this day.
Okay, well I think Nas is the best because he put out Illmatic.
You're wrong, Jay-Z is the best.
What has Jay-Z done better than Illmatic.
That's a good point, Illmatic is better than any of Jay's albums, but Jay's catalog has way more quality stuff in it than Nas.
I judge artists primarily by their master work. I don't see any of Jay-Z's master works (The Blueprint, Reasonable Doubt, et cetera) coming close to Illmatic.
So consistently great stuff counts for nothing?
Not for nothing, but the peak is the most important to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what happened to Iggy Azalea.
She just released a couple of singles.
Have you heard them?
I heard Mo Bounce and Switch. They aren't half bad.
The last I heard from her was that guest verse on the Britney track.
Pretty Girls? That was a bit of a mess.
Agreed. Are her new singles better?
Switch is really hard for Iggy, and Mo Bounce is more easy going.
Would you say they're worth the bucks on iTunes?
Maybe listen on Spotify first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new movie about Tupac Shakur?
I haven't, but I really loved Tupac's music.
Do you like his songs more when he's being political or personal?
I'm not sure I can separate the two. Actually, part of what makes his music so strong to me is the way that he brings the two together.
I think everybody I knew bought a copy of "All Eyez on Me". It was a classic album.
So was "Makaveli". It had such symbolism and depth.
Do you think there's been a West Coast rapper better than Tupac?
Definitely not; he was the all time great. I do like The Game, though.
I like West Coast beats, they are so funky and smooth.
I wish there would be a resurgence of that kind of assertive party music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you hear 50 cent was working on a new album?
No, I didn't know he was still into music.
Yeah, he hasn't really done anything big in a while though.
I know.  I don't remember hearing anything from him in like ten years.
Well, he's had some releases since them.  Nothing really big though.
Yeah, I don't remember anything since Candy Shop and Magic Stick.
Yeah, he's been doing a lot of business stuff.
Hadn't he invested in a mineral water company?
Yeah, I think he had.
He did some acting and stuff too, I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to Kanye?
Who has not?
Some people are turned off by his beliefs.
I mean yeah he sounds like a jackass but I dont fault him for that.
Golddigger is a well oiled song.
Yeah he knows how to lay catchy hooks
What album do you think is his best
I loved Late Registration
For me it was the college dropout.
Thats another great one that i can listen to from front to back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rap music have you been listening to lately?
I have been listening to Kanye.
Which album?
Late Registration.
I absolutely love that album.
What song is your favorite on that?
I love Touch the Sky.
Oh yeah I love that song and the video for it.
Have you listened to others on that album?
Not really to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the song with ja rule and Jennifer Lopez
The im real one?
Yes it is so good
I like it too
I love singing along to it
Me too
They are both great artists
I love J Lo
Shes so beautiful
And had a great voice
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite all time sub-genre of rap?
I really vibe with the early 90's gangster rap like Snoop Dogg and NWA.
That stuff was great, but did you ever listen to the jazzy hip hop of the early 90's?
Not a ton, I was really into the hardcore vibes and rebellious understones of the gangster stuff. Which artists are you referring to?
A Tribe Called Quest released Midnight Marauders, which I consider one of the most classic hip hop albums of all time.
That music was quality but lacked the hard hitting beats that I like.
Artists back then were on a different level lyrically and had such positive messages.
That may be true but the beats didn't bump like the ones produced by Dr. Dre.
Dre was definitely ahead of his time, but I feel like he didn't find his own until he and Eminem delivered "The Eminem Show" in 2000.
Eminem would have never made it in the industry with the production and direction of Dr. Dre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like old school rap ?
I love old school and lets start wirh ll cool j.
I love his radio song.
I love to play that on my boom box.
Do you like run dmc ?
I loved the way they mixed rock into rap.
I also loved salt and peppa.
Wow they were jamming back in the day.
What is your all time best old school rap song ?
It would be lotti dotti.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you call the original MC
I am not sure their is so many to choose from
Well pick one
I am thinking
Stop taking your time
I will take as long as i want
Well fine then
I guess i would choose public Enemy NO.1
Good choice
I know right
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you like?
I mostly like rap
I like rap too
Who do you like?
I listen to ja rule,  Eminem,  ludacris
This are all good artists
Who do you like?
I like 50 cent and Eminem
I forgot about 50 cent
He makes good albums
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Kendrick Lamar's new album?
It's crazy good, Kendrick always delivers!
Yeah, it's a little bit behind his last album overall for me, but it's still better than 99% of everything else out there.
"DNA" is such a jam, and I like the video too.
Don Cheadle is in the video, right?
So is Schoolboy Q.
I'll go with "Humble" as my favorite song on the new record.
My favorite part is the chorus, it sounds like he's saying "Biyombo" instead of "Be humble"!
It would be an even more amazing track if it was actually about Bismack Biyombo.
He should do that for the next album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper of this generation?
I would have to say that Lil Wayne is my favorite rapper these days.
Really, I just can't seem to get into any of his songs.
Yeah man! I just really enjoy the comentary of his songs.
I mean, to me, the lyrics just seem vulgar and disgusting.
I mean, if you're listening to the wrong songs, I could see your argument.
Just look at "Lollipop", it has no message at all other than pure vulgarity.
He may not have a solid message like rappers from the past, but I can still appreciate his music.
I mean, to each his own, I just can't see past how empty his music sounds.
Perhaps it's more a general fault of rap today, rather than purely Lil Wayne, that skews your perception of his music as being empty.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You remember Master P?
Yeah, I remember his music played all the time in the club like fifteen years ago.
Wasn't he from New Orleans?
Yeah, I think he was.  He was associated with a lot of the acts from down there.
Did you have any of his CDs?
I don't remember, but I had one of the 504 Boyz.
They were associated with him, right.
Yeah, I don't know if he started them or produced for him.
They might have been on his label.
Yeah, probably so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you more of an Snoop Dogg or Dr Dre person?
Absolutely Snoop Dogg, was never huge into Dre.
While I would disagree Dre as a whole, I'm a fan, would still agree overall
Yeah Snoop is classic, oddly enough I think the stuff he did with Dre was better than either of their stuff alone.
Oh yeah absolutely. Gin and Juice is essiential.
Renember when he went by Snoop Lion briefly?
Sure do, not sure what he was thinking.
Yes it was bizzare, I'm glad it didn't last though.
Likewise, it seemed like a bad gimmick.
Could'nt agree anymore with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Childish Gambino?
Yeah I do. I love his music.
Me too. I have all of his albums.
What is your favorite song?
I really like Got This Money and The Last.
My favorite is I Be on That and Break.
I wonder if he's done rapping now.
It sure seems like it. He's been acting a lot lately.
He's a great actor, but I really hope he'll still put music out.
Me too. I can't imagine him wasting all of that musical talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Wu-Tang Clan?
Oh jeeze! I don't know where to start, so much talent!
Agreed, you got GZA, RZA, Ghostface, Method Man, Redman, ODB, and Raekwon.
It's amazing, really. They're all great MCs.
So true. Even RZA, who is predominately a production guy can rap.
Yeah! Have you heard about his new project?
No, what is it?
It's actually a collaboration with the frontman of the indie rock band Interpol.
Oh? Are you pulling my leg...
No, I'm serious. It's called and Steelz.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best hip hop artist in 2017?
I have to say Drake, he has been on top for the last 5 years.
Don't you think his music is more pop than hip hop?
I would consider it more commercial but he isn't pop like Justin Beiber.
Fair enough. Do you think he is better now that Lil Wayne isn't a part of the Young Money record label?
As much as I like Lil Wayne, I think Drake has grown more as an artist without any other influnce.
I saw the two of them live last time they toured and I thought Lil Wayne was actually better in person.
Back when he was making hits during Carter II and Carter III, Lil Wayne was the best.
Have you heard anything recently that you like from Lil Wayne?
It's been a few years, but he did a collaboration with Currency that was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the Remy Ma's diss track, ShETHER, aginst Nicki Minaj.
Yes I've heard, it's all over social media!
Nicki Minaj needs to respond quick, Remy Ma based her so bad on the song.
I don't think Remy Ma's diss track was good.
Are you serious, Remy Ma had a nice beat and some really awesome verses.
Not so much, all of her verses were false claims against Nicki Minaj.
Some of them are false, but most of them are actually true!
You don't think she is doing this for attention?
Of course not, I think they are truly mad at each other.
I believe this is all a publicity stunt
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Lil Wayne?
Yeah! I've been listening to him since Tha Carter.
What's your favorite record?
I'd have to say Tha Carter III.
I think that record definitely broke him into mainstream, but my favorite is Tha Carter II when he was still a little unknown.
You don't like anything from Tha Carter III?
I didn't say that, I just prefer Tha Carter II.
What's your favorite song from that record?
Best Rapper Alive, hands down was is my favorite.
That's a great song! I also like Fireman even though it's relatively mainstream.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Walk this Way by Run DMC was one of the greatest rap songs of all time.
What? Only you would say a rap song with rock music was the greatest.
Not because of the song. Because of what it did.
What did it do?
It crossed over into mainstream.
I ain't no sell out. I don't care about crossing over.
Come on man. In the early stages of a music genre the more listeners you can get the better.
I guess I never thought of it like that.
And, if you listen to it, it's not a bad song.
O.k., now you might be pushing it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rapper do you think doesn't get enough credit?
Big Sean, for sure. He is super goofy and completely misses with his lyrics sometimes, but..
But what?
He is a super positive rapper and he has the most fun cadences and ad libs.
I only know a few of his ad libs, like "BOY" and "I DO IT." You're right, those are fun.
Yeah, I really like how fun and goofy they are and I also like that he doesn't have to pretend to be some super hard gang member. He's putting himself out there saying this is who I am, take it or leave it.
Yeah, he has a few songs about finding your passion, appreciating your family, and working really hard. Definitely a positive message.
Right, he writes songs like "Bounce Back" which are about being resilient and struggling through adversity.
He's super confident on that track. I think it has a great message personally.
That's so true! Whether it's sports, music, business, relationships or whatever human endeavor, one has to be resilient and "bounce back."
XXXXXXXXXXX
don't you agree that hip hop music is the most popular music played at bars, next to dance music
that's kinda true, depends on where you are, at college town, hip hop is probably the most popular type of music
who do you like the most?
It's really hard to decide, I have multiple in mind that don't really differentiate from each other
well, who are they exactly?
Young Thug, Drake, G-Eazy ,etc.
good choices, I like their music a lot too, in fact I was just listening to Pick Up The Phone by Young Thug
really?
yeah, those song are very warm and energetic, unlike jazz, which is warm as well, but jazz is usually too chill
yea, jazz almost make me sleep
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i cannot stand mumble rap
I know its the worst is it not
it sounds like crap
Yeah the wording is bad
Excactly
and the beats are never good
its like they do not even know how to make a beat
The beat is the heart of rap
Yep
And without it it sucks
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the rapper Lil Boosie?
I love the dude, his song Smoking on Purple is an all time classic.
You can't get much better than that. I don't think he goes by "Lil Boosie" anymore though.
You're correct. He changed his rapper stage name after getting out of prison in 2014.
What's his stage name now?
It's "Boosie Badazz". I like his new name better then Lil Boosie.
I'm still going to call him Lil Boosie. I grew up listening to his music and that's just what I associate him with.
Hey man nothing wrong with that! What's your favorite Boosie album?
His first one is the best. The album is called Ghetto Stories.
I think that album was actually a duo album featuring Boosie and Webbie. Trill fam!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you even like ICP when they were huge?
I think they had talent but I couldnt get into their songs
They were from Detroit, I think the same area as Eminem.
Yeah I think the clown makeup though was too much
The Great Milenko was not a bad ablum to start off with
No but they tried getting up to that level.
The Wraith was also a great album.
That was more progressively different than rap.
Yeah I think they touched on a new audience.
They needed to re-tell the stories of the joker cards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you hear the  bew trvis scott song
yeah birds in a trap i like that song.
i also saw the vkideo it was off the chain
i know off the chain and long as hell
the video was good thou i like the artistist aspect of it
yeah that was nice it was like a little show
well i hope he recives a award this year hes doing well
he should look like hes pitting a lot of effort into his music
i hope his next track is as hotb a this one
me too i hope his video is as long as the last one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man what sort music do you like?
I'm mainly into rap, but I can appreciate all types of music.
That's great, I've given rap a little bit of a listen but I just don't know where to start.
I may not know too many artists, but I could give you some decent ones to start off with if you'd like.
Yeah man, that would be awesome!
Alright, personally, I really like Future and Drake.
Do you have any favorite songs or albums in particular?
Yeah, I really like everything on DS2 by Future.
Alright, thanks man, i'll give it a listen tonight.
Yeah, no problem. Feel free to him me up for more music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long has rap been your all time music?
For roughly 6-8 years.
How does rap influnce your day to day life?
Well beeping the box, and keeping things low, it makes me feel real with a very big group.
Does rap influence you behavoir?
Sort of, it's wierd, i keep it real with who i hang with and talk low about everything and walk with a dirty mouth and limp like i broke a leg. Drug's for life, yeaaity yeaity!
What is you're favorite album to this date?
Biggie smalls, mainstream, but pure rape. Always different and not the same things over and over.
If you could meet any rapper who would it be?
It would be eminem, famous, rich and some of the most gangster albums to this date. Keeping it real in the hood. iiiiiiiit!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any rap music lately?
I have been listening to Missy Elliot.
I haven't heard her in a while.
Yeah she has a new album out that seems cool.
What songs are you hearing?
Well mainly old stuff. I like Lose Control.
That is a great song! I miss that!
Do you have any albums of hers?
No, just singles.
That is a shame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Dr. Dre?
I like all of the music he did with NWA.
Do you like his first solo album?
Are you talking about The Chronic?
Yeah, that one.
I do. I still listen to some of those songs on my Iphone.
I like the song he did with The World Class Wrecking Crew.
You mean Before I Turn Off The Lights.
Yeah, that song is a nice melodic slow jam.
I think it's a hip-hop slow jam.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to hip-hop or rap music?
Really I don't very much.  I'm not a huge fan.
Me neither.  I guess there are some rap artists that I kind of like, but hip-hop, not so much.
What rap singers do you like?
I'll admit that I like some of Eminem's stuff.
Yes.  Some of it is kind of catchy.
I always liked the first one I heard of his.  I think it's called Slim-Shady.
He always sounds so angry when he sings.
Do you have any hip-hop music you like?
I don't really.  My kids know some of the hip-hop artists, but I don't listen to them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the BET Awards?
I watched clips of the performances online.
Did you see Future perform "Mask Off" with Kendrick?
Yeah, Kendrick really stole the show.
I know, the crowd went crazy when he came out.
He sounded really great live. He delivered everything perfectly.
Did you see Post Malone and Migos perform too?
Yep. I thought it was fun that they did "Bad and Boujee."
Thank god they didn't bring out Lil Uzi to do his verse.
I know right? I feel like his verse kinda kills the song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the hip hop movie about Eazy E
I think it was more than just him
Yeah youre right it was about the Group
Did you like Straight out of Compton?
The song or the movie?
You could answer both.
I thought the song was a great tribute towards their roots.
The movie was also
Yeah I was gonna say I think the movie did their upbringing some justice.
It was a nice piece about the roots of rap
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Drake?
I think he is one of the best rappers ever!
Really? Why do you like him so much?
His lyrics are very clever and I think he delivers them well.
Do you have a favorite song?
I play the song "passionfruit" all the time.
Is that new?
Yes it was off of his latest album.
I haven't heard that record yet.
You should check it out. It has a few songs that I love.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could only listen to one rap artist for the rest of your life who would it be?
Kanye West without a doubt.
Why would you pick Kanye West out of all the other artists?
He's the most  innovative artist there is.  Kanye is always switching things up.
Does he seem a little nuts to you?  Look at how he acts during awards ceremonies.
Kanye has apologized for all that, but he brings the discrimination issues right to the forefront.  He isn't afraid to tell it like it is.
What about Dr. Dre?  He's the one I'd pick if I could listen to one rap artist.
Dr. Dre is old school and I respect him.  But, Kanye brings new flavor.
Nothing will change your mind?
No, Kanye West is my favorite rapper of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard POUND THE ALARM by Nicki Minaj?
They go hard on one chorus.
Sound the Alarm.
It is a big party.
Everyone is dressed brightly.
I like it when they shut it down.
It is kind of like an alarm sound.
They have that fire breather.
And guy with the whip.
The night party looked cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
got a favorite biggie song?
probably suicidal thoughts.
the darkest song on the album.
it definitely is.
then life after death is kinda the sequel to it.
yeah, just from the name alone.
not really a concept album though.
biggie was so young
i think he was like 21 or something
yup
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like Eminem, what do you think of him?
I think he has some good stuff and some bad stuff.
I think his earlier stuff is better in some ways. It's more raw.
His newer stuff is more polished, more technical.
I think he will always be one of rap's best wordsmiths.
He can definitely make things rhyme that shouldn't.
I think his early stuff has a lot of anger in it, but recently it's hard to make that relatable now.
You can't relate to a millionaire rapping about the system?
I think it had more presence when his raps were out of a genuine frustration with his lot in life.
Now he just kind of raps about annoying fans and the jealousy of other artists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to Jadakiss?
I think he gave up on rap
His rhymes were tight.
He could literally touch no one when it came to freestyling.
I bet Eminem could do a better job.
I dont know I think Em listed him as an influence.
I just remember his song Low Down was so hot back in the day.
He had a couple underground albums that were hot as hell.
I wonder what made him give up the game.
Probably didnt want to die.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the new Fear Factor? I can't believe it's being hosted by Ludacris.
Ludacris the rapper?? Why would he be hosting a TV show??
Lots of rappers are into acting nowadays.
I guess once their rapping career fails they move into acting, if they get the opportunity.
Maybe you're right, because he hasn't had a big hit since maybe 2009 or 2010 when he sang My Chick Bad
Let's be honest though, that song only was a hit because he did it with Nicki Minaj.
True, people really love her. I know I do.
I think they were great together. I was hoping they'd do more tracks together.
And be like the new Jah Rule and Ashanti?
Nah, I was more thinking like Fat Joe and Remy Ma. They're both rappers. Ashanti isn't a rapper!
XXXXXXXXXXX
so who is your favorite rap artist
Iwould have to say Camoflauge
I never heard of him
He was a rapper from savannah ga who was killed back in 2003
all man sad to hear that
i know he was just about to blow to
how many cds did he have
like 4 his biggest song was cut friends
i may have to check him out
you should i will let you borrow some cds
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you listen to rap often?
Yeah fairly often.
Cool.  Do you have anybody you really like now?
I really like Anderson Paak.
I haven't heard of him before.
He's got a great tiny desk on youtube you should check out.
Oh I love the tiny desk series.
Yeah they are fantastic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hi.
Are you a fan of rap or hip hop?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you have somebody that you like a lot now?
I like Anderson Paak a lot right now.
Whose that?
He's a west coast guy that sings and raps.
He sounds cool.
You should give him a listen, lots of great tracks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you help me identify the rapper who sings these lyrics? The lyrics are "house real big, car so big, etc."
That's my dude Mannie Fresh man!
I knew the beat sounded familiar. Do you know when that song was released?
The song was released on Mannie's first solo album called The Mind of Mannie Fresh in 2004.
Didn't he perform at Jazzfest 3 years ago with Juvenile?
Yeah he did. Thomas and myself both went and saw the performance. It was great, Mannie is one of the greatest DJ's in the rap game.
Is he still producing music these days?
I know he did some work with Lil Jon and Rick Ross not too long ago but he hasn't put out any solo stuff in a long time.
Pretty sure he still lives in New Orleans, I bet he does shows around the city.
We should try and find out.I would love to see him perform live again. Well worth any amount of money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the recent claim by that Rolling Stone writer that Bob Dylan invented hip hop?
Yeah, I did. What did you think about it?
I honestly thought it was really inaccurate. While Dylan's music shares elements with hip hop, lyricism, subject matter, sing-talking, etc., he didn't invent it.
Agreed. Hip-hop has its origins much earlier than Dylan in African-American music.
Yeah, I think it's attributing a little too much to Bob Dylan's influence. The man already has enough recognition.
Right! He just got a Nobel Peace Prize.
Bob Dylan certainly never did anything like an MC before hip-hop. He didn't use samples, he didn't DJ, he didn't strut around the stage like a rapper.
Yeah, the comparison is honestly a little too much for me to handle. It's like the writer who made it doesn't know much about hip hop.
Yeah, he probably just knows some of the bigger artists and seminal records.
Right, and then he just makes connections based on similarities he hears that are historically without basis.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think old people are too nostalgic for old hip-hop?
I get where they're coming from. A lot of the stuff from the past had way more substance than the newer stuff.
Is that right? I think we tend to remember only the really great stuff from the past and to forget a lot of the fluff.
I guess that's sort of true, I mean, we're not thinking about Vanilla Ice and the Fresh Prince when we think about the Golden Era of hip hop.
Yeah, I think if you filtered out all of the mediocre current stuff and only highlighted the great stuff, it'd be competitive with the supposed "Golden Era" of hip-hop.
True, there are so many great records coming out that are bending genres and doing really cool things. From Chance 3 to The Life of Pablo.
So I'll ask again, are old people too nostalgic for old hip-hop?
I don't know what would constitute "too nostalgic" but they definitely dismiss current stuff too easily and forget about a lot of the mediocre stuff from their own time.
Agreed. I do really miss nineties hip hop though.
I know, I would explode if I got another Illmatic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to the Macklamore and Ryan Lewis show?
Yes, I'm super excited.
I'm so glad you got tickets. I know you're a huge fan.
I am. I've listened to them since before The Heist came out.
What is your favorite song by them?
I really like Same Love a lot. Its such a powerful song.
Its a beautiful song, I cried the first time I heard it.
I love that they are so involved in getting equality for everyone.
Yeah, its always good when a musician or group is socially conscious.
That's a big part of the reason why I like them some much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you can choose a career in music industry, which genre do you think you'll get into?
wow, interesting question, I do rap occasionally in high school, maybe I could be a hip hop singer?
nice choice man, I like hip hop music, they're both chill and energetic
that's kinda like the way I would define them, so what's your favorite song?
Have you heard of Guana?
no, sounds like a funny name
yeah, it's from G-Eazy, be warmed, it's explicit, haha
really, I heard of G-Eazy but I haven't heard of a song from him named Guana, I gotta check it out
definitely, it's good for any occasion, except when your parents are here
oh, indeed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Outkast?
Of course. That was back when hip hop was still awesome.
I was just realizing how many hits they have. It's more than I thought.
I just remember "Roses". I used to love that song.
They also had that "Hey Ya" song.
Oh yeah. How could I forget that one?
"Ms. Jackson" was another really big one.
I forgot about that one too. I guess they did have a lot of hits.
I wonder what ever happened to them.
I think andre 3000 just does his own music now, for some reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
you going to the salt and pepper concert
when is it
sometime next week there doing a tour
yeah i would go if i had extra money
it don't cost but $30 for a ticket
i just spent my last on my bills wish i would have know

i think nauty by nature and a few other rap groups be there next wek a 5pm
thanks alot you know how i love my ole school rap.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Childish Gambino is an incredible rapper.
I have never heard of him before.
You should check him out. His early songs are some of my favorite rap songs.
What songs should I listen to?
Try the song "Bonfire" first. His verses are amazing.
What is Childish Gambino's real name?
His real name is Donald Glover.
Is that the same Donald Glover that is an actor?
It is! He both acts and raps.
That is impressive. What a talented individual.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is the best lyrical rapper?
i think j.cole is the best
no way its kendrick lamar and jay-z
jay z doesnt really make music anymore
jay z is the greatest of all time
who's more lyrical him or nas
nas is lyrical but jay z is more of a spitter
j.cole is better than them both
i think j.cole is good but not the best
all his albums are platinum
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, i'm so sick of all of these poppy-rap songs!
Yeah man, tell me about it.
Why can't radio stations go back to the good old days where rap gods dominated the airwaves?
Personally, I think it's time the rap game go back to what made it great.
Yeah, they need to ditch all the excess noise and get back to their roots.
That's harder than it sounds, especially with today's artists.
What do you mean by that?
Without their autotune, they would all sound like amatures with no flow.
There's gotta be at least one artist with enough skill to ditch all the autotune.
We'll just have to wait and see, because as it looks now, the future of rap seems bleak.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Tyler, the Creator?
I think he's got some interesting music, for sure.
I think he's good. He's really unique.
I thought "Wolf" was a good album. It was kind of weird, though.
He actually makes all of his own beats, too.
That's cool. It just shows that he's multi-talented.
A lot of his albums have a greater concept at play too.
I noticed he was talking about split personalities in "Yonkers".
Yeah, that's a theme through a couple of his albums.
I like when artists have a big enough mental capacity to create concepts like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which rapper has the most creative lyrics?
It's got to be Eminem.  Some of the stuff he comes up with is insane!
I don't know.  Insane might be the right word because the dude is nuts.
Very true. But who else can say stuff like, "my noodle is cockadoodledoo, my clocks cuckoo, I got screws loose, yeah the whole kit and caboodle" and get away with it?
It's true. He can seem to get away with some funny stuff that wouldn't work for other rappers.
Maybe it's his slim shady persona that makes it work.
By the way, what album are those lyrics from?
The 8 mile soundtrack.  It's one of his best.
That's right. The movie was good too.
I agree. It was better than I expected it to be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite era of rap?
I liked the 2000's because we had artist like Jay Z, Kanye West, Nas, Eminem and Lil Wayne.
I like the 90's because we had Tupac, Biggie, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg.
I love all eras except today's era.
I agree, people like Migos and Lil Uzi are ruining the genre.
One thing in rap that hasen't been lost are the samples, they make for great songs.
I love samples in rap music!
California Love and Mo Money Mo problems are my favorite samples.
Rap isn't dead because we still have some guys that are making good rap music.
Yes and those guys and girls will be legends just like the people from the 90's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I absolutely love Eminem how about you?
Yes I like him.
I like his older stuff my favorite song is When I'm Gone.
That is a good one but sad.
What about Cleanin Out my Closet?
Yes I like that one too, they don't play it much though.
He don't like it played anymore because he made up with his mom.
Really is that why?
Yes and he doesn't like to be reminded of that song anymore.
Wow that is surprising.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the name of that rapper who plays in the car movies?
You mean the Fast and Furious movies?
Yes those  movies! Do you know who I'm talking about?
Yes I think you mean Ludacris.
Right. I just couldn't remember his name.
I like his music also, which song do you like the best?
I remember being in middle school and "Roll Out" was pretty popular. I loved that.
Yes most of the songs on that album "Word of Mouf" were good.
I remember borrowing that CD from a friend.
Yes, I also was a fan of the song "Move Bitch" by him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you think is the worst rapper of all time?
I think lil wayne is the worst of all time.
no way he so many good songs he came out when he was like 12 I think
just because he came out when he was 12 doesn't make him good
have you ever heard his carter 3 mixtape with the song kush
no I haven't
that song is one of his best songs I think
how does the chorus go
cause we smoke that kush and ball like swoosh.......you should check it out on youtube
I'll check it out and see it I like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like ludacris?
Yes he is a great artist
I like him a lot too
Im glad they used him and his music in the fast and the furious
Yes that made those movies even better
I have one of his cds
Me too
I really like his music
Hes great
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to listen to music for hours straight what kind would you listen to?
I think I would choose hip hop music.
Why is that?
I like a lot of the artists.
You mean from recent years or back in the 80s and 90s?
Probably a little of both.
Tell me who you liked the most.
I like a variety but I'd have to say that Dr Dre and Eminem are among my faves.
They're pretty good. They collaborate a lot together.
Yes and I can't emphasize enough how amazing they are together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite current rapper?
I'm not sure, I've been listening to a lot of different artists lately.
That's cool. My fave's definitely Lil Uzi Vert.
I've heard XO TOUR Llif 3, it's dope.
It is! Have you heard anything from Lil Yachty?
Yes! I love Harley and iSpy with Kyle.
They're both pretty good. Do you like Playboi Carti?
I haven't heard anything from him besides Magnolia.
I like that song alright. Did you know he did a collaboration with Lil Uzi Vert on wokeuplikethis*?
No, I didn't. I'll have to give it a listen, thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's you're favorite rap group ever?
Mine would definitely be Lost Boys. Their song Renee just gets me every time.
Mine would have to be Mob Deep. I think they're the most influential one ever.
Mob Deeps cool too. I can't believe Prodigy is dead now.
I know right! Such an awesome rapper.
Still though Lost Boys are my favorite. Why can't rappers be like them anymore? I miss the stories these guys tell.
I know. I don't care how much money you lie about having, or about your gold necklace.
HAHA! Yeah, I'd rather be told a story and entertained. Not Hearing about your gold teeth.
Whatever happened? I don't get these guys now a days!
What I really don't understand is the people who keep buying this new garbage!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you head of Watsky
who?
Watsky?
Nope never heard of him
He does that song, I don't give a F***
Huh sounds good anything else?
Moral of the story?
What is it?
It's a song dummy
OH, ok cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was better, Biggie or Tupac?
I think they both were about equal.
I think Biggie told more stories in his music. Pac kept it real.
What do you mean kept it real?
Pac had rap that made you stop and think and want to take action. Biggie told you a good story to listen to while smoking a blunt.
You are so silly. But you do have a point.
I got music from both of them in my phone and on my computer.
Me too. I think I got every album downloaded that Pac ever made.
His best album was All Eyez on Me.
I know right. I can't wait to see the movie with the same title, it looks like it will be good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a fan of Sean Combs?
You mean who used to be Puff Daddy?
Yes that's him. Do you know why he changed his name?
I'm not sure, maybe legal reasons?
Possibly, I'm not sure though.
He's always had great music though.
Yes, remember that one song "I'll Be Missing You."
Yes that song was so sad but beautiful.
It was a tribute to Biggie Smalls when he was killed.
You're right. They were pretty tight I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think is the best in the game right now?
In my opinion, Kendrick Lamar easily.
Really? Which album do you think would be his masterpiece?
While Good Kid M.A.A.D City and "Damn." were great in their own lanes, I think To Pimp a Butterfly will stand the test of time.
True though, to be fair, I think it's a bit lazy to outright say Kendrick is the best.
Who else is possibly better?
Well there's J. Cole, Kanye West, Vic Mensa...the list goes on.
Yeah but I don't think they can touch the pedigree of Kendrick.
Well then why hasn't Kendrick dissed Drake yet?
Wow, that's a good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Drake is as good as everyone makes him out to be?
I mean, he has more Billboard hits than The Beatles. That says something.
That's insane to think about. Music is a lot different now, though.
True. Rappers churn out hits every week.
Yeah it seems like I hear a new Drake song every two weeks.
I do think he's got a good voice and clever lyrics.
He does seem to be able to make anything catchy.
He's got pop and rap music influences, so that helps.
When he released "Hotline Bling" it felt like everyone in the world instantly knew it.
I agree. I think I heard that song over a thousand times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you ever listen to the new Jessie James?
I dont even know that rapper
Yeah hes on a minor label.
What does he sound like?
Yelawolf and Eminem combined.
Wasnt Yelawolf on Shady Records?
Yeah Eminem loves his white rapper
I dont know if hes making those decisions
He definitely is since he puts his name on it.
Did he even produce a cd? I heard from him but never heard a sound from him
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first hip-hop you remember hearing?
Good question, it was definitely Puff Daddy. That song that was memorial for Notorious BIG.
Oh yeah, I'll be missing you. The one with Sting in it.
Yeah, and the music video with the candles everywhere.
Yeah I think Puff Daddy/P. Diddy might have been my entrance point to hip hop as well.
Do you still listen to him?
No, if I do it's not usually by choice.
The classic take is that he's a much better businessman than a rapper.
Agreed. He helped put B.I.G. on the map, but he didn't ever make anything super great.
Right, a crucial player in rap and hip hop, but not necessarily for his musical contributions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to Vanilla Ice?
He just fell off the map.
His lyrics were pretty flat.
He didn't have alot of rhythm.
I didn't like Ice, Ice Baby but he did have one other song that I liked.
I don't know what that could have been.
Play That Funky Music was the name of the song.
I do remember that song from back in the 90's.
He was last on Dancing With the Stars in 2016.
How far can someone fall. Wow!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Lifted?
It is by CL.
It is a hip hop Kpop song.
It was released 2016.
It already had 23 million views.
I think CL is pretty.
She has that long blond hair.
I think it was filmed in LA.
She starts out on the fire escape.
Windows open and everything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the most dreamy rapper ever was LL Cool J.
Yes oh my goodness!
Time has only made him even more good looking.
I totally agree. Which of his songs do you like the best from way back when?
I loved his song "Doin It". Talk about romantic and mood setting.
I really loved that song.
When did that song come out again?
I think it was around 1995 or 1996.
Yes that's right. I remember I was 9 when it came out so it was 1995.
Oh okay, that sounds about right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Chris Brown still make music?
He sure does!
Has he put out any tracks recently?
Yes! He has a song called "Privacy" that is doing very well on the charts.
I haven't listened to him in a long time.
You should check out this song. It has a pretty catchy beat.
He is from Virginia, isn't he?
Yes, he even raps about it in one of his earlier songs.
I am from Virginia. I love listening to artists from my home state.
Then you should keep supporting him and check out his new song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man I think ludacris has lost his touch
Why do you even say that
Because his Rapping aint that good
What do you mean it aint good
It is sort of boring nowadays
Nah no way its still a plus
Eh i disagree
He has only gotten better
Well show me how
I will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the rapper Future?
Future is awesome.
His voice is so deep it almost sounds unreal.
I know. It's hard to understand him sometimes.
He makes some meaningful music, though. He holds nothing back.
Yeah, he's definitely an open-book type of artist.
He releases albums really fast, too.
He released two on the same day just recently.
I saw that. The crazy thing is they were both really good.
I've yet to hear anything I would consider bad from the guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it true that you're a Wu-Tang fan?
Yeah. I was always a big fan of their ciphers.
Really? I think I might have a song that you might like, then.
What's it called?
It's called "1Train" by ASAP Rocky.
Why do you think I'd like it.
Because it's structured like a cipher. There's no hooks, and it's just a bunch of rappers spitting verses one after the other.
That sounds great. Who's on it.
It features Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Big KRIT.
That really does sound awesome. I'll definitely be checking it out soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man the game hits home
Who
You know the rapper the game
I never heard of him
He is a serious rapper unlike so many
So he raps about something other than woman and money
Yeah he raps about life in the streets and how its real
Man that does sound deep
Wanna listen to some of his tracks
Sure thing bro
XXXXXXXXXXX
got a favorite 2pac album
me against the world
no doubt
its much better than all eyez
thats the album everybody knows though
it has so many filler
me against the world was great in its entireity
shed so many tears was amazing
dear mama too
lord knows
XXXXXXXXXXX
who you like better pac or biggie, i think pac was a monster, lol
both of them was greats it's many more though
who's some other then them
i like outcast there ole school.
yeah they rap that southern rap
yeah and they some of the best down south.
i can name a few good artist down south that folks forgot about.
yeah like who
young bleed was one that i would have wished made more music
yeah i forgot about bleed he do go hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper?
I love Eminem.
Lame. My favorite is Drake.
That's even lamer than Eminem!
At least I didn't say Macklemore!
True. Do you like any older rappers?
No I don't like any of the classics. I like the newer artists.
I think Common was awesome.
Yeah. He was! I forgot about him.
I need to listen to more Common now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any idea what Biggie Smalls real name was?
I want to say it was Chistopher something.
Oh that's right! Christopher Wallace.
He was definitely one of the greats, the best of all time.
I know. Can you imagine how popular he would be had he not been killed?
Oh my goodness yes!
I still listen to his music.
I do too, what's your favorite song by him?
"Juicy" is probably one of them.
I love that one too. One of mine is "Big Poppa."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite rapper?
Probably Eminem.
Personally I think Eminem is overrated.
Really, why's that?
He's not any better than any other rapper out there.
Why do you think he's been so successful then?
I think him being a decent white rapper is a novelty, and that's why people buy into it.
I disagree, Eminem has received lots of awards and has been lauded by the rap community.
That's true, but awards and praise don't mean much.
We'll have to agree to disagree on that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite era of hip hop?
I would definitely have to say the 80's. Between NWA and old school Nas, they definitely won me over.
I can totally see that. I think I'm going to have to go with the early 90's, though.
Really? I never thought of the 90's as a staple in hip hop.
Oh, I have for sure. I was won over by TLC and Wu-Tang.
Wu-Tang definitely is a class act. But weren't they popular in the 80's as well?
A lot of people assume that, but they mainly got their break around '93.
That was a good year for hip hop. That was just a couple of years after Outkast was founded.
Outkast has always been one of my favorite hip hop groups since, "Mrs. Jackson."
That definitely is one of the greatest hits of all time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey can you come pick me up to go pick up that new snoop dogg
i did'nt know you liked snoop.
yes he's one of my favorite artist.
yeah i need to pick up some new rap tunes too

XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen SUPER BASS by Nicki?
Yes Minaj has a good video.
The pink jet was funny.
He got stacks like he saving up.
He pop bottles.
I don't know what that means.
And he never fly coach.
She shows his body a lot.
And she is loving his tie.
She is always over the top.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what ludacris' real name is?
I have no idea
Christopher Brian Bridges
Thats a long name
It seems like rappers always have these dorky names
Maybe or maybe we are just so used to their rapper name
That their real names seem dorky
That could be it
Ludacris is better than chris bridges
Thats so true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Know what I love about foreign hip hop?
Not being able to understand a word of it?
Very funny. But seriously.
No, what?
Well american rap can get a bit predictable, I hate to say. I love that with the new accents and slang and everything it opens up a lot more opportunity for unextpected word combinations and things.
You're planning a trip to Ireland, right? That gives you something to talk about with people, the local rap scene.
And, it gives me new slang with which to discuss it!
There you go. I'm guessing they talk about the culture and social stuff in the music, too.
Absolutely, that's actually probably where I first hear about a lot of important issues from overseas. I wouldn't know what stuff to investigate had I not heard it referenced in the songs.
That's a really valuable part of the music right there, whether about foreign places or right here at home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like these new artists like Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper?
Oh they're some of my favorites. They've got this new flow that I really enjoy.
Yeah I get what you're saying, it's not like as aggressive as some of that stuff from back in the day.
What are you talking about? I mean the way he speaks his raps -- who did you know that was aggressive?
Well I mean, just off the top of my head? Three Six Mafia, 'Slob On My Nob' was downright dirty!
Haha, you're right about that. But don't forget about Lil' Wayne, he was one of the greatest, and had some chill songs.
Yeah you are right, I remember listening to 'Hustler Musik' and just kicking it.
Oh that was a really good one. But honestly even his more hype stuff was great, remember The Carter?
How could I forget? 'This is the Carter, so hold on to your teenage daughters!'
Haha! Lil' Wayne has got to get back to that level.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper?
I really like Eminem. I can relate to him a lot.
He hasn't put anything new out for a while though, right?
Actually, he's got a new album due out this year.
I had no idea, I thought he was totally done with rapping.
No, I think he just needed a break. He's been through a lot.
I remember reading that he's had health problems.
Yes, he had a bad addiction to pills and I've heard he's bipolar.
Well, good for him if he's able to move past all that. I'll look for the new album when it drops.
I'll let you know as soon as I get a release date.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish there was more rap groups these days.
There's a few, I think.
Oh really? Name five of them.
Well, Migos are pretty popular.
I said five. That's only one.
Wu-Tang Clan are also still a thing.
Wait, really? I honestly didn't know that.
Yeah, but they haven't put out an album in years.
Oh. Thanks for disappointing me.
Sorry about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is the better Madlib collaboration album: Madvillainy or Piñata?
Madvillainy is definitely more iconic, but I actually prefer Piñata.
Wow, that's really interesting. I didn't know other people felt that way too.
You mean you prefer Piñata as well?
Oh yeah, definitely. One thing I like is all the different features.
Yeah, there are some great rappers on the album. You get quite a variety.
They're both classic albums though. Piñata is only slightly better in my opinion.
Yeah, and they're both very different albums with different stories and visions.
I would love to see Madlib do an album like that with Mos Def.
That would be awesome! Too bad Yasiin Bey says he's retired now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you tell me why their is not more types of rap
Their is a lot of rap
I just feel like only one kind exists
Nah not at all
Explain this to me
Well their is Hip Hop and west coast
Okay how do they differ
Well hip hop is more smooth and suave
Makes sense
And west coast is more focused on rhythm and flow
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard Kendrick Lamar's new album??
Yes!! It is so good, probably my favorite rap album in several years.
I definitely agree with you, did you know he's touring as well?
I saw that he was coming here, but I bet tickets are crazy expensive.
It probably is, Kendrick Lamar is huge right now.
You know who else I've been loving?? Childish Gambino
Right?! He is crazy talent. Definitely one of the best triple threats of 2017.
I would love to see him live, I bet that'd be an amazing concert.
I hear that he's going to stop making music after this album.
That's a huge bummer, I hope he changes his mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper from the past 5 years?
I'd have to say probably Mackelmore. I know he isn't like a super hardcore rapper, but I think his songs are really catchy.
Not to mention pretty funny...
Yea! His songs are hilarious.
My favorite song by him is "Downtown".
That song is too funny, the lyrics are hilarious. I mean it's a song about mopeds, it doesn't get better than that.
But funniness aside, Mackelmore is actually a really talented rapper.
Yea, I'd agree. And the stuff he raps about is really diverse...it's not just all about sex and girls and the "thug life".
Yea, he raps about thrift stores, mopeds, equality. I think those are things that people can relate to a little more.
For sure. His songs are so catchy too, they always get stuck in my head.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite hip-hop star?
Uh... Puff Daddy?
Puff Daddy? You know he hasn't gone by that name in something like ten years
Which tells you how big a fan of Hip-Hop I am.
Hip Hop is cool. You should give it a chance.
Nope. I won't pay someone to cuss at me and tell me how I should go out and have sex with sluts and kill cops. No way.
Very, very few hip-hop songs talk about killing cops.
Guess how many country songs talk about killing cops?
All country songs are about trains, trucks and your woman leaving you.
Hey, at least they're not killing cops or doing coke or screwing hoes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Lil Kim was a good rapper?
She was not that bad but she was aided by Biggie
Yeah I think you are right on that one
I liked Eve better.
Where was she from?
Philly if I recall correctly.
Yeah I think you are right, she did alot of collabs with other artists.
Yeah she was featured in some Ja Rule tracks that blew her up
She stood out on her own as well
I think she was a pretty solid performer and would achieve success on her own. Her lyrics were good for women.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you're saying Kanye West is an egomaniac?
Are you saying he's not? Have you gone deaf and blind? I mean I'll admit he's made some great albums.
Did you just say "albums"? Are you the last person on earth who doesn't DJ but still uses that word?
Hey, don't get mad at me because I have an appreciation for the classics.
I think you mean "ancients". You gonna pull out your Victrola too? And later on go see one of those talking picture shows?
Dude. Now you're avoiding the Kanye Concession. I know this little game.
What?
You're about to have to admit that he's more conceited than he is talented. And ever since "808s  and Heartbreaks" you've been very sensitive about him.
He's got a kind soul, I can just tell. "Heartless" is a timeless classic and absolutely pure of spirit.
I beg to differ. Nothing is pure after that much auto-tune.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that rap music is better now than when Tupac was alive?
Absolutely not better than Tupac!
Well, I agree that he was a legend in his time, but what about artists like Common?
I think Common is good but he's got nothing on Tupac.
Well, I think that rap today has some great artists who are more expressive in their music.
Yes, they are like T.I. but they are doing more than rap and that's like diluting the rap industry with other things.
But what you call diluting is actually more of creativity. Do you think Tupac wouldn't be diversifying today if he were still alive?
It's hard to say because he was specific to his genre during his time but he did venture into acting as well.
So maybe rap today would be better if he were still around?
I think it definitely would.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of your favorite rappers?
I like Kendrick Lamar.
Oh cool, what song do you like the best from him?
I like the song "i".
That is a very good song.
I know, but for some reason only the music video has a decent version of the song.
You don't like the traditional version?
Not so much. It lacks that depth and flavor.
Understandable. Well it was nice talking to you!
You too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the Wu-Tang clan?
Yes. I love their stuff.
Do you have their albums?
Yes.
They are a unique group
I agree
I head the album Wu-Tang forever and loved it
Awesome. I like them a lot too.
When did you start listening to them?
Back in the 90's
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Lil' Wayne?
People bash him a lot but I think he's good.
I agree. He's got some of the most clever lyrics ever.
I think a lot of people that hate on him just aren't understanding him.
Definitely. People also just don't seem to like the way his voice sounds.
I honestly prefer it to someone like Kodak Black.
Yeah, some of these new rappers are just mumbling.
I seriously can't understand what they're saying sometimes.
Neither can I. Obviously they're doing that intentionally.
True. I think it's a style choice for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Tupac song always been "Keep Your Head Up" because he was speaking highly about women in urban America
True, I liked that song also. Being that my favorite rapper is Biggie, my favorite song is "Sky is the Limit."
Kendrick Lamar is what's hot right now. Have you heard that song "Humble" ?
Yeah, I heard it. But I like his album "To Pimp a Butterfly" better.
I think K Dot is bringing back real hip hop back to life. His bars are phenomenal!!
I feel that. So what do you think about female rappers?
I personally like Nicki Minaj. I get hyped when I hear her song "Did It On Them."
That track was cool, but "Shether" by Remy Ma blew that out the water.
Aren't Remy and Nicki beefin' right now? I mean they both are cool to me.
Yeah, man. That whole battle with the back and forth between these two ladies is getting real ugly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some motivational rap songs that you know of?
Explain what you mean by motivational. Get moving motivation or inspired motivation?
I'd say get up and get moving motiavtion.
I'd say Survival by Eminem. It's a very energetic and hype song.
Interesting I'll have to check it out.
What about you? What song would you consider ge up and go motivational?
I'd say Stronger by Kanye West.
Yeah thats a decent one.
I'd consider it my all time favorite but it's hard to really find others like it.
I can agree with that. You really have to search around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Ice Cube, or Ice Tea?
To drink?
No, the rappers, who is better?
I do not like either.
Well, what rapper do you like?
Dr. Dre is the all time best, I think.
Maybe a good one of the still living rappers.
Well, I guess Notorious BIG would be the best of all time.
No, I would go for Tupac myself.
I think their issues with one another made them even better at rapping.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any rap or hip hop?
Yes, I love Kendrick Lamar's older albums such as Section. 80 and Good Kidd, M.A.A.D City.
You don't like his newer albums?
I think they're good, but I don't find myself wanting to listen to them.
What don't you like about the newer albums?
I just feel like they're made more for the mainstream. I feel like "Be Humble" was made to be played at NBA games.
Hm, I disagree. Have you heard any good songs on the radio lately?
No. None. I heard an awful song by Ugly God called "Water". Maybe it was meant to be terrible, so I would rememeber it...
I guess it worked if that's the case. What's so bad about it?
It has an annoying water drop sound effect and the lyrics are so idiotic. It sounds like no effort was put into it. I thought it was ameteur/local at first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the current best rapper out?
I would say Kendrick Lamar?
Why did you choose him?
Overall, I think that he has the best rhymes and best people around him.
I would have to agree, he is pretty good.
I really liked his last album called 'DAMN'
That was a great album.
What was your favorite track?
DNA was my favorite.
Oh yea, that was the best on the album
XXXXXXXXXXX
What song was considered to be the first rap song?
Oh, that was Rapper's Delight.
Who was it that released that?
Sugar Hill Gang, of course!
Oh, yeah, I remembered the band, just not the group.
Yeah, I had to think about the name of the song, but I knew the group offhand.
When was the song released?
It was in the early 80s.  I might have even been 80.
It was such a fun song to listen to.
Yeah, and it was a lot different than anything at the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's the album from Drake where he sits on a very tall building?
I think that's photoshop, but I think I know what you're referring to
what is that?
let me give you a hint, he was sitting on the tallest tower in Canada, so he could have a great view of everything down below
oh, it's called the Views
exactly
I love that album so much, I listen to that one a lot last summer
wanna a recommendation of what to listen this summer from him?
fire it up to me
His newest album More Life
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rapper is really good live?
I think Snoop Dogg is one of the best.
I agree. I never saw him live.
He is good.
I like Notorious B.I.G
He has some great songs.
Yes. I wish he was still around making music.
Me too.
Is he your favorite?
No. I am a big Eminem fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Nicki Minaj?
I'm not really a fan, but she is talented.
Do you think she is a good role model?
Definately not!  I mean, listen to her music.
She is a great artist though, and could show girls they could be want they want.
She has said herself in interviews that she should not be a role model.
Oh, really?
Yeah.  I respect her for at least acknowledging that.
She doesn't even want to be a role model?
It doesn't seem like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i still think will smiths raps are fun
But are they not a bit clean
And?
I am just saying
Is their a problem with it being clean
Just sounds sort of boring
Nah it does not need vulgarity for fun
I mean i guess you got the right for that
I mean it clean stuff can be fun
Okay if you think so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you have listened to Lil Dicky if it was for Eminem?
Oh yeah Em broke through
I think that he needs to go back to rapping about women and killing people.
The track Kim was so distrubing
He could paint mental imagery like no other
It just made me feel uncomfortable.
Then he had that song called Drug Ballad.
Yeah and that was all too real as well.
I think thats why people loved him, he rapped about relevant things and painted pictures
Yeah I think thats part of his overall appeal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to very much rap that's political in nature?
Not really—is there political rap?
Absolutely! Some of the earliest stuff that was commercially released has political messages.
Like what songs?
Well, "The Message" by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. It came out in the early 80s.
Old school.
Totally. But it's really interesting—all about the plight of the inner cities in the early 1980s. Has a lot of really interesting social commentary, not just good rhymes.
Grandmaster Flash? Isn't he also a DJ?
Oh yeah, he's awesome. So amazing at scratching and cutting and he wasn't even using a laptop of anything! You should check out the movie Wild Style for some of this old school style.
Will do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the current state of hip hop?
I think it is horrible?
Why do you think it is horrible?
It's horrible because you don't have to be any good to get on the radio.
What do you mean?
DJs and radio stations are playing songs that are horrible just for views and listeners because it pays money.
I agree, but we have a few good rappers out today.
Yes, Kendrick Lamar and J-Cole are amazing.
They are and I like their songs as well.
Overall the state of hiphop is going down in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, I heard you like rap, do you listen to Eminem?
Hey, well of course I listen to him, The Eminem Show is one of my favorite albums.
Oh for sure, Hailey's Song is definitely one of my top favorite songs.
That's a good one, he actually sings in that one. But I also like to listen to Atmosphere, you heard of him?
Slug? Well duh, you're speaking my language brother. Yesterday really hits home for me, the twist at the end really blew me away the first time I heard it.
Oh ya, I heard about what happened about your dad, I'm sorry brother. Atmosphere really knows how to articulate life.
That is so true, Trying to Find a Balance used to be something I told myself all the time, that song really kept me stable, pun intended.
Yep, Slug has kept me from falling over myself, too. But you can't forget about Del the Funky Homosapien, he keeps you moving and grooving.
Oh Ya, Del! Isn't that Ice Cube's Cousin?
You are correct sir, I feel Del is less ganster rap, but I can respect what Ice Cube puts down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper?
I like Eminem.
What is your favorite Eminem song?
My favorite Eminem song is Without Me.
That is a great one! I enjoy the real slim shady!
That's funny. I'm slim shady yes i'm the real shady.
Do you like the old Eminem music better or the new songs?
I prefer the old songs.
Yes, I agree the originals are much better.
I agree he is not as good anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is the best rapper?
probably 2pac
he was amazing but not the best as a lyricist
thats true. he just related to people and had passion
rakim is the best lyricially.
or maybe nas
nas is the best.
illmatic is amazing
it definitely is
and he was only 20
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you listen to ASAP Rocky's newest CD?
Yeah, that came out awhile ago.
I was listening to it again the other day. So many hits on that CD.
For sure, the beats on that cd are insane.
I do feel like he could have cut some of the songs out, though.
Definitely. That CD is long.
It's got 18 tracks on it!
That's a whole lot for a rap album.
There's like 9 of them that are really good, though.
Yeah, it's rare for a rap album to have that many good tracks on it anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of this years XXL freshman list?
I don't know really, a lot of those artists I haven't even heard of.
I agree, PNB Rock and Playboy Carti seem like the only ones who deserved it to be honest.
Definitely, The line up should had Kodak Black or at least NBA Young Boy.
Yeah for sure, if you had a choice who would of been your XXL picks?
Kodak Black, NBA Young Boy, Famous Dex, Playboy Carti and YFN Lucci. How about yours?
I definitely would of picked NBA Young Boy, Blac Youngsta, Nav, Sahbabii and Trippie Redd.
I can agree with that, it just seems like this year they didn't have hardly any diversity.
You're right they definitely just wanted to follow the trend and stay relevant.
Maybe next year we'll get better picks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Snoop Dogg is still touring?
I know, it's crazy. He's getting old.
It's even crazier that he still has so much support.
Yeah, but he's a legend. Those types of people will always have fan support.
That's true. He's been doing it for a very long time.
Didn't he try to change his name to Snoop Lion?
I think he actually did, but everyone still calls him Snoop Dogg.
It's hard to get a change like that to stick.
For sure. "Gin and Juice" is stuck in my head now.
That song is a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seed RIGHT BY MY SIDE by Nicki Minaj?
I like after she gets the car.
Chris has cool glasses.
And picks her up.
He has a cool hair cut.
And she is not living right.
Unless you are by my side.
I like his shirt also.
They have their favorite spot.
She is always so stylish.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music you are into?
hip hop for sure
why is that?
because they're ruthless and violent?
haha, that sounds like a legit reason
it still got good vibe at the same time, you like them?
yeah, I listen to them sometimes, I was just listening Guana yesterday when I was taking a shower
oh, that was a funny song
yes indeed
I should let that song go with my shower next time
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, do you listen to much rap music?
I won't lie to you, it's not really my favorite genre, but there are a few guys I do.
Really, like who?
Well, I'm more into "old school" type rap, like Run-DMC, Public Enemy, NWA and stuff like.
Oh, yeah, I listened to a lot of those growing up.
Yeah, for example, really loved "It's Tricky" by Run-DMC and, of course, the duet they did with Aerosmith.
Oh, yeah, both of those songs are classic!  "Walk This Way" was the one they did with Aerosmith.
Yeah, I'm told it really helped bring rap music into the mainstream environment.
Yeah, I remember when I was a kid they used to play that video and "Tricky" a lot on MTV.
Oh, yeah, back when MTV actually PLAYED videos!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to ja rule?
Yes i like him
Me too
I used to own his pain is love cd
I love the duets he does
With jennifer lopez and ashanti
Yes
They are so good
I enjoy them
I love always on time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Prodigy passed away?
The rapper from Queens?
Yeah, he just died today.
What happened?
There's no official cause yet.
I'd heard he was having trouble with sickle cell anemia.
Wow, he wasn't that old, was he?
No, he was only 42.
Wow, it really makes you think.
I know, he was such an influential person, what a shame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoy listening to nelly
Me too
He is a really good artist
I just looked up his real name
What is it
Cornell Iral Haynes, Jr
Thats a wierd name
I wonder where nelly came from
I do too
It seems random
XXXXXXXXXXX
whos is the best male rapper of all time?
the best rapper now its i think  is kendrick lamar but rapper of all time, i dont think i can choose
You have a point there i mean we have eminem, 50 cents, Snoop dog,Tupac,Notorious Big, Jay Z and a lot more
i think its Tupac
why tupac and not Eminem?
Because Eminem can rap really fast and medium fast
But Tupac has a story behind his Raps
and Eminem also has a story
well everyone has a hidden story or a Non-hidden story
i guess all the rappers are good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like rap or hip-hop music? Who do you like?
Actually there are no particular artists, I kinda listen to whatever comes on the radio, but back in the 80s and 90s I like folks like Bel Biv Devoe, Snoop Doggy Dog.
Oh cool. I listen to various artists too. I like 50 Cent myself.
Oh yeah, 50 Cent! I particularly like his HIT song. I don't remember the title but the lyric was something like go shorty it's your birthday, something something.
I think it was called In Da Club.
That's right! It was a really nice dance rap song.
I remember during a party I went to, the moment that song went on, literally people jumped out of their seats and started going to the dance floor!
If I'm not mistaken Fiddy was managed or at least frieends with Eminem or something.
Yeah that could be. I think Eminem helped with one of his songs.
Cool. I like it to see different singers and rappers actually collaborating with eath other.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like songs with dances. I wish more songs in rap and hip-hop had dances to go with them.
You mean like the macarena??
Yes! Just like that, but in rap
Remember that song by Fat Joe and Remy Ma called "Lean Back'? That had a fun little dance.
Yeah even my mom was doing that dance that year!
My mom is cooler than your mom. My mom was doing the Superman from Soulja Boy's song "Crank That"
That song was a lot of fun! What ever happened to Soulja Boy?
I guess he was a one hit wonder, because that was the first and last I'd ever heard of him
Actually had another song I liked although I don't remember the name. They lyrics went "Jumped out of bed, turned my swag on"
Oh yea! The name of the song was actually simply "Turn my Swag on"
XXXXXXXXXXX
has kid and play ever been to your city?
I think so once are twice are they stil rapping
no i don't think so
when was the last time the put out a cd
it's been so long i can't remember
me to they where good when they where hot
yeah i agree i wish they played more music like that today.
yeah alot of this rap now a days is crap
yeah they rap about the same old thing.
yeah money cars and women and clothes it's still some good one's out there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think rap music has changed since the 1990s?
Definitely, it has changed. It's so much better now.
Do you think the lyrics are better or the beats are better?
The beats are better. The lyrics are basically saying the same things over and over again.
Why do you think that rap music still exist?
It reaches a newer generation. You can't reach a certain generation with other genres of music.
Do you think that rap music influences the way that young people act?
To a certain degree it does. You are influenced by what you see and hear the most. And for some young people, all they do is listen to rap music.
Did the movie "Straight outta Compton" seem realistic?
That's a good question. Straight Outta Compton is real for the many people who live in gang infested neighbor hoods. It shined light on things other peoply may or may not have seen or known about. Like who would have thought that most of their lyrics came from reality.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's the type of music that you listen most often
it's definitely hip hop
is there any reason that you love them?
well, they tend to blend in with the atmosphere very well, especially at my apartment where most people are college students
that totally make sense, they're usually very chill and very american
well, in general, they usually have some very naughty lines about black cultures and girls
so what's your favorite artist in this genre?
to be honest I like all of them, they don't sound that much different
what if you have to choose one?
well Drake it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you think is the greatest rapper of all time?
That is a hard question to answer but I think that Eminem is one of the best if not the very best.
why is that? because most people would have said Tupac or Biggie.
I think that Biggie was better than Tupac but i think that had both lived later in life they would have played out
What do you mean?
I think that both of them would have played out to the full extent of their talent, I dont think that they had what it takes to have a long lasting career at the top.
And you think that Eminem does?
I think that he has already been at the top for a long time and I think that he will continue to show up at the top.
Why is that?
I think that he has the ability to create different emotions in his music from comedy to anger and sadness and is very open in his music and truthful and those are things that will connect with almost anyone is some aspect so I think he will continue to have a long career at the top.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who all has Dr. Dre made famous?
I think two of the most prominent people are Eminem and Kendrick Lamar.
Oh, I didn't realize he helped Kendrick Lamar!
Yeah, they're both from Compton and Dr. Dre put Kendrick on early.
Interesting. He seems to have an ear for great artists.
Yeah, those are two of the most iconic rappers of the past twenty years.
It's interesting that both of them have staked a good deal of independence from Dre. They don't overuse features or production by him.
Yeah, I think that was important for both of them, to not be seen as leaning too heavily on Dre.
Right. YG, another Compton rapper has this line about being the only rapper to make it out of the West without Dre, and while Dre helped Kendrick, I think it's kind of unfair to imply that he wouldn't have done it without Dre.
Right, it's not as if Dre was the only one who was recognizing Kendrick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rap have you been hearing lately?
I have been listening to the song called Count Contessa.
Oh cool, who raps that?
Azealia Banks.
What style is she?
She is rap but is a fusion too of garage music.
Sounds interesting.
Take a listen next time you are at it.
I definitely will.
It has a beachy club feel to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of Eminem's first song?
It was My Name Is.
Oh, now I remember.
Yeah, I remember the first time I heard that song.  They were playing it on the alternative station!
Really?  They probably didn't know what kind of music this was.
I sure didn't.  I thought it was a novelty or parody act.
Yeah, most people probably did.  Did you have the CD?
I bought that one and his second one.
Did you like it?
It was more serious than I expected, but I loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know ja rules real name?
I have no idea
It's Jeffrey Atkins
That's a wired name
I wonder where ja rule came from
I have no idea
He was born in Queens
He sounds like he was from new york
Yea he does
Bye
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man you what is the best type of rap
What sort
The old school west coast stuff?
Like?
Like old Snoop and Dre
Those are tight
Yeah they had a way with words
It was almost mystical
It was for sure something else
Most definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like newer rap?
No, I think the 90's stuff is untouchable.
I agree. The new stuff does not have a good sound.
Back in the day we had Ice Cube and Easy E and Eminem
They put out tons of classics
Ueah, the new stuff just does not have a very musical feel
Yeah, it doesn't have good beats.
Do you like Soulja Boy?
I'm not a fan. I prefer the oldies like Dre.
yeah, Eminem and Easy- E were very special rappers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like the Notorious B.I.G.?
Well yeah, I love him!  He was one of my favorite rap artists in the nineties.
Yeah, it's too bad he was shot.
I know!  I bet he would've kept making good music.
No doubt.  He and Dre were awesome back in the day.
Yeah they really were.  I think he's still alive, though.
That's possible.  His album Ready To Die was amazing.
Yeah, you could play the whole thing without skipping any songs.
Yeah, they were all great.
Yeah, they were.  I wonder what his songs would've been like if he'd kept making them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Korean Hip Hop?
I thought it was a joke at first, but I actually like it.
I know. Its not like the rap or hip hop here in the US, it has more singing in it and shows vocal range.
True. Its like the rappers are more like Idols than just rappers.
Exactly. Sometimes you can't even tell if a group is a hip hop group or a idol group.
Big Bang is a good band that shows that.
Yep. G Dragon is really good at that. He sings and can rap.
I know. I love his music, Crooked is probably one of my favorite songs.
Did you hear he is going on tour this year?
I did. I want to see him live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer single rappers or rap groups.
I've only ever listened to single ones.
So you've never been too fond of groups.
Not that. I just haven't been exposed to much rap groups.
Listen to NWA.
Why? Are they a big deal?
Well, they don't exist anymore, but they're easily the most influential rap group ever.
Wait. Now that you mention it, the name sounds familiar. Who was in it?
Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy E, MC Ren, and DJ Yella were all members.
Oh, okay. I know who they are then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's this huge stack of CDs?
Well remember I was going to loan you some Class A'z?
This is all Class A'z?
About half of it is.
What's the rest?
Well Class A'z has consisted of several different artists who've also done other stuff, so some of it is that group as a whole and some of it is the individual artists' solo ventures.
Oh cool! This looks like it will take a long time to get through
Don't feel obligated to continue listening to an album if you're not digging it, but I'm sure you'll find some good stuff in there.
Thanks, I really wanted to expand my musical horizons.
No problem!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i love 2chains music
I do not know it is kinda bland
What you mean it is bland
I do not know it is missing something
Whats it missing man
Just feeling you get me
How so
Well the rhymes are whack
Nah your whack bro
Meh
XXXXXXXXXXX
You should really give Missy Elliot a chance.
Why?
Cause she has a great sound.
I see what you mean. I am not into female rappers though
She is one of the best
Okay. I will give her a shot
Sweet. What album would you like to hear?
Da Real World
That is one of her best
Cool. Hopefully I will like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to know a place that has way more great rappers than you'd expect?
Sure, what's this place?
Long Island, New York.
No way. Long Island is all upper class suburbs isn't it?
Not exactly. Either way, some great rappers are from there?
Who?
Public Enemy, Rakim, MF Doom, KMD, Busta Rhymes, Aesop Rock, and Prodigy to name a few.
Wow, those are some of the most critically acclaimed rappers of all time. Is there an area where most of them come from?
Not exactly, but two towns that border on each other, Hempstead and Uniondale are home to Public Enemy and Busta Rhymes among others.
I guess I need to expand my definition of what New York rap is, i thought it was only the five boroughs. Like Nas from Queens, Wu-Tang from Staten Island, and B.I.G. from Brooklyn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder why Katy worked with Migos on Bon Appetit.
I'm guessing that was a label obligation.
What did you think of it?
I thought they did a really good job with their verse.
I was left wanting a bit more.
Well not everybody can be as good as Kanye.
Kanye needs to come back too. I miss his music.
I feel like it's getting harder for him to get radio airplay.
He doesn't need it. He's already got the cred.
That's true. He'll go down as a legend no matter what.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to nelly
A little
I have his country grammer cd
I used to have that somewhere
I liked his dilemma song
The one with kelly rowland?
Yes
That was a good song
And it can be so true in some situations
Yes exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which artist is your favorite rapper?
I don't know that I can choose just one, but I'd say that I like 90's hip-hop best.
Like Tribe Called Quest and Naughty by Nature?
Exactly.  I do like some of the more serious rap as well, though.
Anyone in particular that I should consider?
Wu-Tang Clan, of course, Dr. Dre, Jay Z and Nas are all favorites for more hardcore rap.
I see you're more of an East Coast fan than West Coast, would you agree?
Yeah, I'd agree I skew East Coast.  Mostly, I like good beats and I like when people have fun or are sincere and lyrical.
So do you like the new hip-hop artists that are more focused on social and political issues rather than gangster issues?
Like Drake, Kendrick Lamar, and J. Cole?  Yeah, those guys are all great too and they kind of throw back to the 90's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is wrong with rap music?
What do you mean?
All these new rappers suck.
There are a few good new ones.
Name one?
Chance the Rapper is pretty good.
I guess he's okay.
Kendrick Lamar is pretty good.
I've never heard of him.
There's more rappers than Eminem and Jay-Z.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best female rapper?
I'm not sure, I don't know a lot of female rappers. Maybe Nicki Minaj?
Nicki is good, but I don't think she's anywhere as good as Lil Kim or Missy Elliot.
Wow, I haven't heard those names in a while.
They might be older, but both of them have the rap chops that I don't think Nicki has.
Nicki can rap really fast though.
Yeah, but rapping fast doesn't mean everything.
I guess that's true.
The really important things are whether or not you are doing some unique and original, and I think Nicki is kind of basic.
Yeah, she kind of is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How good is Jay Z
He used to be good
You dont think he does a good job still?
No hes more into producing
He was the king at one time
Yeah and that went away a while ago
Now hes more of a businessman?
Hes a business, man!
Ahh one of his great lyrics
You know it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think I can be a rapper. It doesn't take much talent.
Do you have a singing or spoken word background?
I don't think I need either. All rap is is talking quickly, and I always speak quickly.
Rap is a lot more difficult that just speaking quickly. It is a musical artform like anything else. Maybe it seems easier to you that it really is.
Don't get me wrong, I really like and admire artists like Eminem and Jay Z. I think people like that have great flow and charisma.
They also are great storytellers who are basically poets. Many rap songs address so much current news, culture etc
That is certainly true for Eminem at least.
Did you know there is even a course in rap linguistics at the University of Calgary in Calgary, Alberta. Or that many rappers had training in world-famous music & arts schools?
That's really admirable. Which rapper went to arts school?
Are you familiar with La Guardia High School for the Performing Arts, from the movie Fame? Nicki Minaj and Azaliea Banks and a few others went to school there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man you got internet
Yeah i got some internet
Well i want you to check some videos
Cool what are they
They are rap videos
What are they called
Some guy named Joji
Is he good at it
He is like an asian rap god
Sounds intriguing
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found out that Will Smith used to be a rapper.
Yes, he rapped the opening song to Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
But he did more than that.
He did?I didn't know that.
He was in a movie called The Wild Wild West and rapped the song for the movie.
I wasn't aware of that.
He also had a hit called Parents Just Don't Understand.
I had no idea he was a rap artist.
I know. Most people see him as an actor
He;s really talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Eminem?
I think he had a very rags to riches story.
Why do you think that?
You don't know his life story, they made a movie on him.
No they made a movie about him?
Eight Mile.
What was found out?
Well he lived in a trailer had a hard life and fought his way to even get a gig when Dre saw something in him and took him under his wing the rest is history.
That's awesome, I didn't know he had a rough life.
Yeah it's sad but also happy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lil Wayne is the best artist out of New Orleans right?
I don't know. I like Big Freedia better.
Freedia is good but she's all bounce. Rap it a little different.
I suppose. I like Master P too.
Yes, he's good. What about C murder?
Oh, he's a little rough for me.
I also like Chance the Rapper. Chicago is where it's at.
Chance is great. I love Coloring book.
What about Kanye?
I love Graduation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like chance?
i dont like his voice
yeah, it takes some getting used to
i did like him in ultralight beam though
that is actually why i gave him a second chance
he stole the show in the song
he really did.
kanye views him as a protege i think
both from chicago
yup
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite type of music?
I have been listening to rap and hip hop mostly.
I love to listen to hip hop when I want to dance.
Me too, I really like the old rap music from the 90's.
Who do you listen to the most?
I really like Missy Elliott.
I like her too.  I used to listen to eminem often as well.
His music is  always so interesting because it tells a story.
Great talking to you!
See you soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rapper right now?
Right now I would have to say J Cole.
Which album? His newest one?
No, I'm actually still listening to "2014 Forest Hill Drive"
That's my favorite by him, too.
What's your favorite song on that album?
It's definitely "A Tale of 2 Citiez".
The beat for that song is crazy.
I still think it should have gotten more radio play. He's too good.
As far as lyrics go, I have to agree with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite lyricist of all time?
that would be Keith Murry
yeah he is good and his vocabulary is off the chain.
my favorite song is most beautiful thing in this world.
I haven't heard that song in years. I bought the cassette when it came out.
cassettes, I remember those day. Rewinding the tape over and over until it didn't work any more.
I wonder if Keith Murry has any new songs out. I haven't looked for him on youtube in a while.
me either
I'm going to see if I can find any new tunes from him today
that's what's up I'm going to do that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like ANACONDA by Nicki Minaj.
And Drake is in it also.
His anaconda don't.
Unless you got buns hun.
It has a really cool beat.
Video is creative.
A pineapple on the turn table was funny.
I didn't know she had a big butt.
I wonder if why added to it.
Like a butt enlargement.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite Tupac song of all time?
Wow, that's a tough one to answer!  He had so many great songs.
I know!  It'd be easier to make a top ten list than to pick one.
Yeah, for sure.  But I guess if I had to pick one I'd pick Until the End of Time.
Oh yeah, I love that one.  I'd say California Love, though.
Yeah, that's definitely on my top ten list.
I wish he had kept making music.  He was unbelievable.
Yeah, he was truly a legend.  There will never be another artist like him.
No, definitely not.  It's a tragedy.
At least we still have his music to preserve his legacy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like D12
Yeah I thought they were great
Why did they stop rapping
Proof died I think
So why not do it without him?
Then Eminem stopped doing much with them
Ok theres still 4 guys.
That kind of rap got old quickly
They had the talent to reinvent themselves
Yeah but all they knew was doing drugs and people dont want to hear that anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new Rappers that have come out lately.
I really dont consider them rappers most of them I dont like.
You cant even name one that you like? Thats pretty bad
Kendrick Lamar Is probably one of the best new artists that i can respect and actually call him a rapper.
What about Drake
Drake is not a rapper in my eyes. From what i hear he dont even write his own stuff.
So it matters to you if a rapper writes his own lyrics. People that sing dont be writing the songs but they are still cinsiderd a singer
True but rap is diffrent your telling about your life your struggles and that dont match up if someone else is writing it
I guess What about future
All that man talks about is getting high I like rappers that take your on a journey with there words that fool act taking nobody nowhere
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like rap music?
I like some of the older stuff, but I'm not familiar with a lot of newer artists.
Really? There are some great ones who are releasing music right now.
Like who?
One I like is Run the Jewels.
That's an unusual name for a rap group.
Yeah, but they're really good. Are you familiar with Killer Mike?
No, I don't think so.
He's an excellent rapper, producer, and DJ. It's his group.
Cool, maybe I should check them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Brittany Spears.
I have so much to say about here.
Well do you like her music?
I never really liked it but I thought she did an alright job back when she was big.
So what don't you like then?
What I don't like is she kind of crumbled under the pressure and had a meltdown.
yeah she had a lot of bad publicity for years.
Finally seems like she finally found a place though.
Seems to have turned her life around.
I agree and applaud her for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any new girl rappers you'e been listening to?
Yeah, I like Cardi B. She's been getting popular lately.
I think Cardi B is cool. I like BIA, her song "Whip It" is good.
Oh yeah, they kind of have a similar style. I want to hear them on a song together.
Yeah that'd be dope.
I liked Kamaiyah too.
Yeah? Didn't she just make the XXL freshman cover?
She did! Her song with YG is so good.
You think she can become popular?
I think she already has a strong following.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to any rap music?
I listen to some. I've been listening to a lot of Macklemore lately.
What is your favorite song?
Thrift shop is a classic.
I like that one but my favorite is Same Love.
One of the reasons I like his music is because he conveys a message for equality through it.
So true. He has a lot of respect for others.
I also really like Drake.
His new alblum is so good!
Agreed each song is so unique.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard POUND THE ALARM?
I think it is by Nicki Minaj.
It starts with that tropical sound.
It was filmed in Spain.
It was released in 2012.
Filmed in Trinidad.
I like the steel drum sound.
She had big hair.
I liked the scenery.
I liked the city view.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Mac Miller?
I'm really unfamiliar with his music.
You have to check him out.
What song would you recommend?
I really like his song "New Faces".
I will check it out. Is he good with lyrics?
Yeah he's got an interesting mind. He's good with beats too.
Is it old-school sounding?
No, it has a newer sound to it. It's unique though.
Awesome, I'm always looking for new rap music. I'm not a big fan of old-school rap.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about gangsta rap
Well I loved NWA
NWA started the whole thing and I loved Easy E
I love Ice cube
Dre had the music on point.
The lyrics were so true to the era and what was going on at the time.
What is the best NWA song ?
I would say they all were good.
I liked easy e solo carrer, He had some hits.
Easy does it was the best song ever by Easy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Wu Tang Clan?
Of course, what true hip-hop fan doesn't love them!
Do you have a favorite Wu Tang artist?
I have a couple but i would have to say Method Man.
He had to be their first shining star out of the bunch.
He was just so charismatic and demanded the spot light instantly.
I was a big ODB fan in the beginning myself.
Are you kidding me? ODB changed the entire game with his style and delivery.
Yeah he was the wildcard of the crew for sure.
Brooklyn Zoo is still a classic this very day. Rest in peace ODB.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music?
It depends.
I like the old school stuff.
Me too - Cypress Hill and Public Enemy.
I went to see an Eminem concert.
His lyrics are pretty good too.
Tech Nine also has some interesting lyrics.
I would go to see him.
Rappers now are so fast talking it's almost absurd.
Sort of keeps them from getting the point across.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Lil Dicky?
Is he a white rapper?
Yes from PA.
I think I may have heard of him.
He raps about saving money and stuff.
Oh ok yes I know who you are talking about.
Yeah he is pretty good
I think he flows really well
Thats one of his strong points in my opinion.
I would go see him live if he came around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen how much old school hip hop is making a comeback?
Yeah, the whole new wave of TuPac love.
I do not think Tupcac was ever not loved.
His songs really speak to me man.
I loved when he was in Digital Underground.
He was in a band?
Yes, back in the late 1980's and early 1990's/
Really, who else was in the band?
There was a guy called Humpty. They had a song called "All Around the World".
I heard that one, did not know it was Tupac in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest female rapper of all time?
Hands down Missy Elliott. I've always loved her style of music.
Yes, she really is an individual and very identifiable. No other female rapper has the same sound as her.
Exactly. People always say Lil Kim or Foxy Brown, and I ask them what is the difference.
True, they have similar sounds and used to have a similar sexy look back in the day.
I think Da Brat is also really talented. I'm not sure if she raps anymore though
I haven't heard much from her for a while but she really used to be one of my favorites. Her and Trina.
Trina? I remember the name but can't remember what song she sang
She had this big song about 10 years ago called "Here we Go"
Oh yes, featuring Kelly Rowland. I liked that song actually.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you think is the best lyrical south rapper
i would have to say mac from no limit
thats a good choice he is good
who is your favorite
i would say mystikal i like his still
mystikal was crazy on them track
him and mac have a song together
i know its one of my favorites from shell shocked
i miss those days of rap
i know right only if we could go back
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think happened to Tupac?
I don't think he was killed.  I think he went into the witness protection program.
Do you think he is still alive?
I don't know, maybe he is.
If he weren't killed I don't know how he kept coming out with new music.
True.  It is odd that there was new songs of his coming out after his death.
Maybe he had a vault like prince did.
That could be.  Or maybe he is in hiding.
He was into a lot of stuff and I'm sure he had lots of enemies.
I'm sure of that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which rapper had the longest career success?
That's easy; for me it will always be Dr. Dre.
I was thinking more like Big Daddy Kane.
I like his work, but Dr. Dre has been around longer.
I think Dr. Dre is worth more, like 740 million; but Big Daddy is in the MTV best MC's of all time.
Dr. Dre won MTV awards too.
Also look at the whole picture; big daddy worked with Tupac and Biz Markee.
Dre was in the biography about Tupac.
I guess they're both good, hunh?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Easy-E?
Yeah, he is one of my favorite rappers.
What group was he associated with?
NWA
Is he still round?
No, he passed away because of an illness
What is a great song of his?
Nobody Move
Was he from America?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
I liked hip hop back in the day, you know the grandmaster flash era?
O yeah for sure, grandmaster flash was a pioneer, he paved the way for hip hop.
You cannot forget about the sugar hill gang though!
How could I forget man? they were also the bomb, they were the originals.
Remeber that song by sugar hill gang? rappers delight? remember the video?
O yes! the video that had all the bboys and breakdancers? Amazing dancing skills.
I think Back in the day when grandmaster flash and the sugar hill gang were about, they really made breakdancing known to the mainstream!
Yes indeed, they were the gods of mixing, scratching and breaks. The influenced hip hop and breakdancing, laying down the foundations.
Many of the new school hip hop artists still use the same method of producing music as they did back in the day, but put a modern twist on it.
Yes I agree, you can here the influence in modern hip hop, dre, snoop, dmx. You can can hear elements of the never forgeting hip hop artists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the rapper Danny Brown?
Not really. His voice is so odd.
What do you mean by that?
His voice is very nasally and whiney. I don't like the way it sounds.
Bur what about his lyrics? Do you like those?
They aren't bad. But it is hard to get past his voice.
You should listen to songs like "When It Rain" or "Really Doe"
Do you think I would like them?
I do! Even though you might not like his voice. I think those songs are impressive enough that you can overlook it.
Ok then. I'll take your word for it and check them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any rap music?
Yes, my favorite rapper has got to be Eminem.
Oh yes, he was one of the best rappers, I had all of his CD's from years ago.
So did i! All of his songs were so memorable.
I wish he would come out with another CD.
So do i, music is not the same like it was years ago.
Do you have a favorite song of his?
Yes, i have two favorites, Mockingbird and Slim Shady.
My favorite songs of his are all of them from his album "The real Slim Shady".
I agree, I loved listening to his music while in the car with the windows rolled down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's your favorite rapper of all time?
oh boy, that's a hard question
come on, you gotta choose
well, if I have to choose, it's gonna be Drake then
good choice, I like him too, he got style
for sure, especially Hotline Bling, right?
haha, right. But what other music you listen from him?
umm, he's a really productive singer, in a blink of an eye, there are just 2 more albums coming out from him, I listen to all of them
I like Views, the album was great
so as the cover
XXXXXXXXXXX
It has really been a long time since I've heard a good rap album.
Really? There's been tons of good rap albums.
Not for me. I stop listening to rap after Tupac died.
You've been missing out. There's been classics that have been released since then.
Name one good rap album that came after 1995.
2001, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, Good Kid, M.a.a.d. City, To Pimp a Butterfly, I can go on.
I said just to name one!
I know, but I'm trying to prove to you that there's been a lot.
Maybe I'm just stuck in the past.
Maybe? You clearly are!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you have a favorite rap album?
I'd definitely have to go with "All Eyez on Me".
The Tupac album, right?
Yes indeed. That album's a classic, and it still holds up to this day.
Great choice. I'll have to go with Nas' "Illmatic" myself.
That's not a bad choice either.
Both of these albums are great representatives of East and West, too.
That's very true. Didn't notice that before.
I feel like we should definitely bring Biggie into this topic as well.
Agreed. "Ready to Die" was an incredible album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Are you interested in rap?
Yeah I like rap alright.
Do you like the new rap that is out now?
No I don't really like it at all.
Why is that?
It all sounds so similar.  Rappers all sound like each other with a few exceptions.
Who are the exceptions?
Probably Drake and Kendrick Lamar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Snoop Dogg changed his name?
Yeah, to Snoop Lion right?
No, he changed it back.
What do you mean?
He was going by Snoop Lion, but then he changed it back to Snoop Dogg.
What's the point of that?
I don't know, I guess it's to represent a shift in his character or his music.
It sounds more like a publicity stunt to me.
It seems like a dumb thing to do for publicity.
I don't know, it worked out for P Diddy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Have you listened to a lot of rap music?
I don't think I would say a lot no.
Do you have a favorite track?
Oh man tough question.
Think about it.
I would say maybe that ice cube song about aks.
Today was a good day?
Yeah that is a great track with a great sample.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about young thug
I dont think about him
Ha Ha HA What is that susposed to mean
It means he is not someone that i listen too I think thats for you ng people who really dont know what real rap sounds like
Yeah he does have a younger crowd but you would be surprised older people love him too
Well this one dont Did you see on instagram how he said he the new tupac. I almost punched my computer screen
Yeah i seen it but i didnt understand why everyone had a problem with it
Because if tupac was alive he probably wouldnt even like him
Wht do you think that tho you dont really know
Because he wears dresses I dont think tupac would of stood for that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer west coast or east coast rap?
I definitely prefer west coast rap.
Tupac has always been my favorite.
It's a shame he died so young.
I also loved old school EZ-E and NWA.
Yes, that was when rap was at it's infancy.
Are there any current rappers you like?
I definitely like to listen to Eminem.
He's for sure one of my favorites. I love his lyrics.
His music can take you to dark places, but he always keeps it real.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Remy Martin and Nicki Minaj going at it back and forth?
Yeah Remy's Shether record was fire!
I agree she went all the way in on that song.
She had a lot of personal jabs at Nicki that hit hard.
What was the name of Nicki's reply back with Drake?
I think it was called No Frauds.
Yeah i wasn't feeling it as much as Shether.
It kind of sounded like a commercial song with a diss verse added in.
I don't think she could go diss track for track against Remy.
I agree, i think Nicki clearly lost the battle for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that drink in the Nicki Minaj video?
Anaconda had a blood colored drink.
Her workout in the hut was funny.
There is no gym like that.
Micheal slang cocaine.
Her dresses where pretty.
I like the black dress.
Her high heels were cool also.
Her hair was pretty.
And she makes a sundae.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what kind of music I love listening to my friend its called Rap music. I like the kind of rap music from back in the day too.
Yes me too so what's one of your favorite oldies and can you watch them on You Tube?Of course type the name of the Artist in and all kinds of their music will pop up.
Alright i didn't tell you who I liked yet remember Sugar Hill I think they were one of the first Artist that got Hip hop moving and won the first Grammy's.
Yes I remember them they came out with Rapper's delight 8th Wonder Apache and all of the rest of the first rapper's Hit's they were the best to me.
Lets have a little fun rapping The Sugar Hill was my favorite I am going to say a few lines of the rhymes in that record so listen up then it will be your turn.
Okay have you ever went over a friends house to eat and the food just ain't no good I said the macaroni soggy the peas are mushed and the chicken tastes like wood.
Now you what came after that? so you try to play it off while you think you can and you say that you already ate and then your friend says man there's plenty of food so he piled some more on your plate.
My turn and so the chicken still steaming your mind starts to thinking of the moment it's time to leave and the chicken still rotten and something it looks like cheese.
Yeah that was the coolest rapping and rhyming back in the day hip hop songs its so old i got a bit confused with some of the parts but we still had fun didn't we?
Yes we did my friend now i am going on You Tube to look for some more oldies but goodies to talk with you about the next time we get together and chat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any rap music lately?
I have been listening to Azealia Banks' new song.
What song is that?
Playhouse.
Oh cool how is that?
It is interesting.
Is the album out yet?
Not yet.
Hopefully it will be released soon.
That is what I am saying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you listening to?
Oh, I'm listening to Public Enemy's discography again.
How long does that take?
Well they have 13 studio albums, so...
Nice. Where are you at right now?
About halfway through It Takes A Nation. It's probably one of my least favourite of their albums but it gets good around that last 3 or so songs.
How so?
It's just when it really seems to pick up and you can feel more energy in it. The rest of the album doesn't excite me and sounds basically the same.
I hear ya. I know some albums like that, from people like Ice Cube mainly.
I'm glad you can relate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What ever happened to Bad Boy?
P Diddy got huge
And then he stopped rapping?
I dont think he wanted to do it more
And became more into the business side?
He started producing more often
Wasnt he a producer first?
I think so
Then turned a rapper when Big died?
You got the story right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard Remy Ma dissed Nicki Minaj.
She did, on a track called Sheether.
Is that a sly reference to Ether?
It is, but I wouldn't say it's as clever.
What's it like?
Well, it's really bald and the lyrics are blunt. She was not playing around.
It seems everybody is coming for Nicki these days.
Well when you get that high on the charts, somebody is gonna gun for your spot.
That's true. Same thing happened to Lil' Kim.
And even she has come for Nicki!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to any rappers lately?
Logic.
Oh I love Logic.
What song do you like?
I really like the song Metropolis.
I like that song too. I also love The Jam.
I have not heard that. I should try to hear it.
Definitely.
I enjoyed talking to you!
Same to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you rather Ludicris as a rapper or an actor?
I actually didn't see a lot of his acting, but he was one of my favorite rappers.
You really liked his rapping?
Yeah, he really had a good flow, and he had a ton of good songs.
I remember hearing a lot of them on the radio, but I never had any of his albums.
I had a few, and they were all extremely awesome.
Do you wish he would come back to rapping?
Oh, definately.  Even if it was just for a couple songs.
Or to guest appear on someone else's stuff?
I'd rather him have his own album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
listen to that new e40 have you heard it?
yeah a little of what song you listen to
that had it in a drought
is it a good song
yeah you know 40 go hard
yeah he's a dang good legend
yep i got almost all his cd's
i got a few myself how many you got.
man i dont want to count it's alot thoe
yeah he is a artist to keep in the collection, lol.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Future the best rapper around right now.
No I would say Kendrick.
I dont think thats true.
Sure it is look at his album sales.
Yeah but thats not indicative of skill
Yes it is, thats the only measure.
Not true, he  has abilities past that.
I think Lamar is good for 3 more albums.
Thats a sign of longevity in todays game.
Or he could join a rap supergroup.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like hip hop music?
oh yeah, I listen to them in my car all day
turn your bass all the way up, right?
exactly.
do you download those music or stream them?
I found it extremely convenient to listen to them on Spotify, it also gives me new artists recommendation everyday
that should keep you refreshed
for sure, I followed a station, and it gives me the hottest songs everyday, like today I saw Drake's Signs' coming to the top
oh Drake, I remember he made a very weird music video, where he danced in a lightinig box
haha, that created a huge internet sensation, a lot of memes were invented after that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember 50 Cent?
I do! He used to be so popular!
My favorite song from 50 Cent was "In Da Club"
That song was such a huge hit when it came out!
Yes, him and the various people in his G-Unit crew had great careers.
Is he still making music?
I think so! He also invests in things too.
What kind of things does he invest in?
He invested a lot of money into Vitamin Water many years ago.
Wow, I am glad to hear that he is getting creative and finding new ways to make money. That is a smart move.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about that new Sampha album?
Process, right?
That's the one, man.
It's really good. But I'm not sure I like it as much as his work with SBTRKT.
I completely understand. SBTRKT and Sampha were made for eachother.
I wish they'd keep working together. Everything they do is gold.
Yeah, but at least we still have Sampha's voice. Nobody matches it.
Too true. Did you hear that collaboration with Solange? Cranes in the sky?
Perfect song. I didn't think I'd ever be into Solange, but I was wrong. I actually bought her album after hearing that song.
I have it, too. I would never tell anyone else this, but I like Solange better than Beyonce.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright, greatest rapper of 2017, go!
Wow! Put me on the spot there ..... I'll say Drake.
Really? To be honest I haven't heard any of his new album.
You haven't listened to More Views? What are you doing with your life, Passionfruit is a bop!
I don't know, I guess these days I'm really into these Chicago rappers.
Oh like Kanye?
Well of course Kanye is always included, but more like Chance the Rapper and Noname Gypsy.
Noname Gypsy? Who is that?
What? She's such an amazing rapper, I don't know what it is she's got this cool and calm flow.
Oh so like Chance? I guess that city really breeds talent -- I'll check her out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer older rap artist or the new rap/hip-hop?
I love older rap artist and songs. You could understand what that where saying
Yes, now of days I do not understand the words or could even hear them.
Tons of new artist are changing rap/hip-hop in a bad way
That is true I dislike some of the new rappers such as Lil yatchy and Kodak Black.
There music seems to be a mixture of rap and rock-n-roll
I never thought of it that way. I just thought they were screaming and saying crazy stuff.
It sounds that way to us but younger people are in love with these new rappers.
I know I wonder how rap music will sound like in 10 years
There is no telling but I hope it goes back to sounding good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the rapper Future?
Yeah, hes one of the best rappers of all time.
He just came out with that hit Mask Off.
I love that song, its so catchy.
Have you heard any other new rap songs by him?
Yeah, there's one called Draco that is really good.
I'll have to listen to it, now that you mentioned it.
It's definitely worth it, I've replayed it about 100 times by now.
Haha, sounds like a great song then.
For sure, I can't get enough of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ever heard of Nick Hakim?
No, man. Who is that?
He's a hiphop artist. I think he's kind of new.
Yeah, I've never heard of him. What's his music like?
Well, it's hiphop, like I said. But he's also got this really funky 70's vibe going on.
Like a psychedelic thing?
Yes, exactly. You should check out the song Roller Skates. You'll never get it out of your head.
Now you've got me curious. Does he have any videos?
Yep. In fact, Roller Skates has a really trippy video. You should look it up.
I will, man. Thanks for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was speaking to a friend during the week about the new 2 Chainz album.
Oh, that one. I thought it was awful.
That's exactly what I said. He didn't take too kindly to it.
I take it that means he's a fan.
Yeah. He's actually been listening to him for over 5 years.
How can you go for so long with such bad music?
Again, that's what I'm saying.
I mean, we do have to respect others' opinions.
That's true. I didn't consider that when confronting my friend.
He'll get over it soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of rap music do you like?
I like that hard hitting stuff from the late 90s.
Have you listened to OCA?
No I have not.
Oak Cliff Assassins is a great album.
I will check it out.
Yes there are a few really great tracks on there.
Ok thank you for the recomendation.
I am sure you will enjoy it.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think hip hop music are bloody awesome!
yeah, I like the way people express their ideas so ruthlessly
exactly, it's like breaking an invisible social confinement ever so elegantly
even though the song itself can be violent, right?
Yeah, but you know, they're an important part of black culture, and I appreciate that
yea, about that, I'm not trying to be racist or something, but I feel only black guys can do hip hop
Yeah, it's kinda true, punch lines just come out from their mouth smoothly, even without too much thinking
so what hip hop songs you are recently listening to?
They all sound similar to be honest, I just like the ruthless vibe
I can't agree more
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Lupe Fiasco's newest cd?
No, when did that come out?  He's not one of my favorite rappers so I don't really keep up with him.
It came out this February.  It's called Drogas Light.
Is it any good?
I liked it.  The song Promise was definitely the best I thought.  I heard the album was a lot of old songs he had written and reworked.
So its not really new stuff?
Apparently only a few songs are new, the rest were stuff he had thought of previously but didn't really get around to recording.
That's kind of lame.  I thought his best album was Lasers so far.
That one was good but I thought only one or two songs were really worthy of being singles.
My favorite was The Show Goes On.  That one was all over the radio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rap are you listening to right now?
I've been listening to a lot of eminem
Ahh he is a classic.
Marshall Mathers is a great album
I think 8 mile was a really good movie because of the music
His whole rise to stardom was such a good story.
His old songs are probably my favorite compared to his new stuff.
Yea, Lose Yourself is on my playlist for spotify.
I hope he continues to make new songs
I'm sure he will, its his calling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot stand Kanye West.
Man, that's some basic business to hate Kanye.
Why should I think any differently of him?
Once you realize that he has purposefully pushed the bounds as a performance artist for years, you will begin to understand.
Oh here we go with that illuminati stuff.
Kanye's artistry is deep and has adapted quite well to the changing landscape.
I did like the song "Through the Wire".
The Chaka Kahn sample used on the track is amazing.
What happened to the old Kanye?
If I knew the answer to that question, I would be one rich person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was and still am a huge fan of Twista.
He was a rapper?
Yes he rapped really fast. So fast you almost couldn't understand him.
Right I do remember him now!
My favorite song of his was "Slow Jamz."
That was a great song.
Yes it was. It came out my junior year in high school.
I listened to his CD all the time.
He is definitely original.
Oh yes he is, you don't hear rappers like that today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Memphis Bleek.
He was a great rapper in the late 90s.
What was your favorite song.
My favorite song was 'Is that your chick'
I think he was one of the best rappers line for line of his era.
I agree, he was very good at his time.
I forgot, which group was he apart of.
He was part of the Rocafella team with Jay-z.
Oh yea that is right, those were the good days.
Hip hop was amazing in the late 90s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really hope M.I.A. doesn't retire.
Didn't she just drop an album?
She did, but she's been hinting that it might be her last.
Oh, no! I really like AIM.
I liked AIM a lot too, and Matangi. But I tihnk she's having label troubles.
I've been hearing that about her for a while.
Do you think it's the end for her?
No, I don't. I can see her dropping a new mixtape.
She's just too good to disappear.
There really isn't any other rapper out there like her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you consider the current best rapper?
Maybe Birdman?
Oh heck no hes older than dirt!
maybe Lil Wayne
I think his time has gone
Well I dont know then you keep arguing.
You could say Future.
Yeah Future is pretty good
He cares about his community as well
I heard he was an activist
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Migos?
I like their song T-Shirt. Another one I like is One Time.
I think they play Bad and Boujee way too much!!
I agree. Just like Future and his song Mask Off.
They play Mask Off a lot but it's a hit. I think it was way better than Turn On the Lights.
Young Thug's album Jefferey sounds pretty good, but they don't play it much.
My song on that album is called Rihanna.
Yeah. I noticed all the songs on Young Thug's Jefferey album is named after famous people.
Young Thug is part of the new generation hip hop, like Lil Uzi Vert.
The best song by Lil Uzi in my opinion is Money Longer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite member of Migos?
I like Takeoff the most.
Wow really? He never gets the props he deserves.
I know, right? He's the best rapper out of the bunch.
I agree, Quavo is the melodic one with a great voice. Takeoff has the best technique, Offset is in the middle of the two other members.
What's your favorite Offset verse?
I loved his verse on "Dat Way". What's yours?
I always liked his verse on "Hanna Montana".
Nice, I forgot about that record, I need to go back and listen to their older albums.
For sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's your favorite rap or hip-hop song right now?
Probably "Congratulations" from Post Malone.
I love Post Malone, too.
He's easily my favorite new artist of the last few years.
Mine too. His voice is so smooth.
His songwriting is incredible, too.
My favorite song by him is "Too Young".
That song is so underrated. Most people would say "White Iverson".
Yeah I've heard "White Iverson" too many times to like it anymore.
I agree. Although it was a strong release for being his first big song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see any rappers live?
I saw Eminem live.
Was he really good?
Yes. He had a great voice.
Where did you see him?
I saw him in Detroit
What song was your favorite live?
My Name Is
I like that song a lot.
It is even better live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So many of my friends went to Ultra Music Festival this year in Miami. It looks great but it didn't play the type of music I like.
What type of music do you like?
I like rap / hip-hop music. I wish I could go to a big music festival that was mainly rap artists.
Actually there are a few music festivals with mainly rap.
I have only heard of parties, but I'm referring to huge outdoor festivals with thousands of people.
I know. You should check out Summer Jam in New Jersey
When is it?
It happens ever summer. One year I went and it had an amazing line-up including Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean, Joey Badass, 50 Cent, Remy Ma and more
Wow that sounds like a great line-up full of great rappers
Another one is Urban Beach Week in Miami, but I've never attended.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick the best rapper of all time who would you choose?
That's a tough choice, let me think.
Can you think of one?
I think Dr. Dre was the best.
Yes he was definitely a great one from back in the day.
He collaborated with a lot of artists as well.
What was your favorite song of his?
I think probably "Forgot About Dre".
Yes that's one of mine too!
I also loved his song "Kush".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Drake?
I think he releases some decent stuff every now and then, but I wouldn't say I like him.
Any particular reason why you don't?
Honestly, I just feel that the majority of his music is a little too emotional.
What specific examples do you have to support that idea?
Well, for instance, 'Take Care' was a great album but all his songs are too focused on how the women of his life shaped him.
Isn't that what a lot of music is about?  Also, is there a different standard for male hip-hop artists to not be as emotional?
Well I would rather listen to how other events shaped him as well, rather than just the women.
I personally believe that vulnerability is a fresh angle to hip-hop and rap, since it is so rare.
I will concede that to you.  Drake does stand out from the crowd in that genre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music
I dont listen to it all the time
Do you listen to it
Yes sometimes when im in the mood
Oh okay
Do you like anyone in particular?
I like ja rule
He's good
Who do you like
Snoop
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, have you listened to Drake's new album?
No man! I don't listen to that garbage!
What are you talking about? Drake is alright. What, are you not a fan of his?
Nah man. I don't listen any of that new junk! The golden age of rap is dead!
Oh really, so what do you listen to then?
I only stick to the classics. Nowadays, everybody is sellin' out!
Do you have any artists in particular who you would say are the best?
Most people would respond with someone like Tupac or Biggie, but personally, I think MC deserves a spot among one of the greats!
You can't be serious man! That one-hit-wonder?
Hey man, if you can't appreciate his genius I see no reason to continue this conversation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Prodigy from Mobb Deep died?
Yeah i heard, he was only 42 years old.
Mobb Deep was one of my favorite groups growing up.
Yeah they have some great song in their resume for sure.
One of my favorites is Quiet Storm.
That song tore up the charts for a while when it was first released.
I know, it still holds weight till this very day.
I love the song Shook Ones.
Man that beat gives me chills every single time i hear it.
I'm a have to blast The Infamous album later today in his memory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, are there any other rap groups/songs you like?
Uh... a few here and there.  I like DMX's "X Gonna Give It To Ya"
Oh, yeah, remember hearing that on Deadpool!
Yeah, a lot of people do, but that's not where i first heard it from.
Really, where did you hear it from?
Film called Cradle 2 The Grave.  It had Jet Li and DMX.
Don't think I saw that film.
It wasn't too bad, had a lot of action in it, and some comedy as well.
Cool, I'll have to look it up.
But, yeah, that song was a big part of the soundtrack.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rap and Hip-Hop today is the same as it used to be?
No way.  Gone are the days of EPMD.  Nas is still out there, not making music so much but still on point.
I know.  I loved EPMD.  Strictly Business and You Gots to Chill were my joints!
Yeah, but what about Public Enemy?  Remember the LP Fear of A Black Planet?  Now that was dope!
Oh yeah, they were on point too.
Do you remember the song, Fight The Power?  And what about Boogie Down Productions, KRS-One?
Fight The Power was a national anthem.  KRS-one is trying to educate now.  Too bad rappers today are still in the dark, sheep as it were.
Yeah, they mostly rap about nonsense.  Money, drugs, and degrading women.  There are a few decent ones though...
Do you think we'll ever get back to conscious rap and real hip-hop?
I doubt it.  It's a whole new ballgame now.  It's all about the money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
NWA was one of the most influential rap groups of the 90's.
They had alot of controversy.
True, but they also shook alot of things up.
All of the artists went on to bigger and better things.
Ice Cube is a big time actor now.
Dr. Dre went on to create and produce more music.
It was sad when Easy-E died though.
That was very unfortunate, but that sometimes goes with the lifestyle if you aren't careful.
I wonder if they will ever have a reunion?
If not, you can always go and watch the movie about their early careers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rap artist?
I can only pick one?
Yeah, if there was only one to listen to for the rest of your life who would it be?
I'd have to pick Eminem.
Interesting. Why did you choose him?
His songs actually have a lot of meaning and substance to them.
Meaning I get but what do you mean in terms of substance?
Well it's not just a beat and lyrics. You get a story in almost all of his songs. He has the most variety.
I can agree with that. He's done comedy, real life topics, and hype songs as well.
Exactly, with Eminem you have a true total package rapper.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What type of music do you like?
Rap and country.
I thought you hated rap?
I know. When I went to rehab, though, everyone listened to rap and it grew on me.
That's crazy.
Yeah, haha. When I was using I couldn't stand rap music! Now I can't get enough of it!
What made you change your views?
I guess listening to the lyrics.
Like what?
Oh, just the ones about shit I can relate to. Mainly the drug songs. Or just songs with good beats.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you get a chance to listen to my last mixtape?
Yeah I did.
What did you think?
Honestly, it just wasn't my taste.
Okay I can respect that.
It's not a criticism of you, even within my favourite artists there will be songs or entire albums that I'l listen to and feel like if I never hear it again I'll be okay, and those are my favourite artists.
Like who?
Like Public Enemy. Their first studio album I thought didn't last long enough, but their next album was a struggle to get through and a relief when I finally finished it.
Well no offense taken, I'm just happy you gave it a fair shake.
Yeah of course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Jay-Z?
Absolutely he is one of my favorite rap artist of all times.
Do you have a favorite Jay-Z album?
I would probably have to say The Blueprint album is my favorite.
I heard Kanye West produced a lot of the songs on that album.
No wonder they sound so soulful wouldn't you agree.
Without a doubt. I actually thought the Black Album was a great album as well.
Yeah you can't take anything away from that joint, it had a bunch of classics on it.
We should have known he would take the industry by storm just by his debut album.
Ah, Reasonable Doubt! A hip-hop masterpiece to say the least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Slim Shady LP might be raps best album ever.
Yeah Eminem knew what to do.
I have to give props to Dre as well
He produced it right?
Yeah he hooked them beats up!
He has an electic background that allows for that in my opinion.
I just think hes good.
I think he knows what he is doing.
Thats for sure the dude has had a ton of hits.
Not really, I think he found Eminem and rode that gravy train
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking the other day about the beginning of hip hop.
Yeah, what about it?
I was thinking about the spirit of Rapper's Delight
That was, and is, the ultimate get up and move song
The flow was so naturalu you didn't question what it was when you first heard it.
True
The words stick to your brain no matter how long its been
That is a part of the rounds of hip hop: words
Word form at and a story creation that you can relate to
The story flows on
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard BEEZ IN THE TRAP?
I thing that is by Nicki Minaj.
It is from 2012 I think.
It has 154,000,000 views on YOUTUBE.
There's that disco ball.
She cusses a lot.
I like the video.
What are beez in the trap?
It has a simple beat.
If you need a hit I am with that bat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to get upset with the new hip hop, but then I just decided to spend my time and energy revisiting the older music I prefer
What bothers you about new hip hop?
It doesn't sound good.
Like the beats aren't as good or the lyrics aren't as good?
Both aren't as good to me
Do you think it has to do with over-production or under-production?
It just doesn't sound like the boom bap anymore.  It's just all electronic now
But isn't boom bap generated all electronically as well?
Yeah, but they sampled records, and now it's all sounds from the computer; beeps and lasers.
I don't even listen to hipk hop anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite decade of rap music?
Probably the early 2000s because that's when I was a teen.
Yeah? What artists did you like?
I jammed out to Outkast, Lil Wayne, Snoop Dog, TI, Gucci Mane.
I've never heard of Gucci Mane. Who is he?
He's a rapper from Atlanta.
What does he sing?
He sings a song called Icy.
What's your favorite 2000s rap song?
Probably Mrs. Jackson by outkast
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what hyphy rap is?
Is that from the east coast? or Texas?
Neither, it's from the Bay area!
That's cool. Who are the famous hyphy rappers?
E40, Keak Da Sneak, and Mistah Fab are the most popular three
I know E40, he does "Tell me when to go"
I've heard his music even in Arizona
And what about Keak Da Sneak? What's he sing?
He has a good song called Super Hyphy
Oh, I have heard of him too! He's awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Busta Rhymes is overrated?
The exact opposite.
How can you call him underrated when hes featured in alot of stuff.
Because no one mentions him among the greats.
So you think hes less of a rapper?
No, I just think hes a bit undervalued.
He does have a unique delivery.
I think When Disaster Strikes is a hallmark rap album.
In what sense?
That it should be considered genre defining
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider Fred Durst a rapper?
I mean I guess you could say he was
He doesnt do it anymore?
I havent heard anything from him
How about Kid Rock?
At one point he was.
And ICP?
Yeah they are a hip hop or rap group. Not very good though.
I think the makeup looks silly to be honest.
It looks like trash!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, what happened to real rap?
What do you mean real rap?
You know, like MC hammer and Vanilla Ice....
Ha! those were the days.
Oh and don't forget Will Smith.
Will was actually pretty decent.
Well, without hammer we would never have had Eminem so we owe him that.
We also Got SnoopDog
Lil Wayne
Don't forget Ice Cube
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Snoop Dogg still make rap?
No he is more of an entertainer now.
Does he still have his marijuana ways?
Like does he smoke? Yeah probably does.
I mean more along the lines of does he care about weed?
He still smokes it but I dont know if it consumes him.
He was such a good rapper back in the day
Anything he did was a chart topper
And I think that people relate to what he was rapping about.
Yeah most of his fan base also smoked the devil's lettuce as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't stand this new rap music, I think it's all garbage. What happened to the great 90s artists, like 2pac and Biggie?
That's a really closed-minded statement man! Not all rap music is like the stuff you hear on the radio, you gotta listen to underground stuff.
What kind of underground stuff? Do I look like I live in a hole to you?
That was a good one man. But anyways, you should check out SoundCloud, there's a lot of great rappers on there who aren't getting the exposure they deserve.
Care to name a few rappers for me to look up when I get home?
Well, if you're into alternative or experimental stuff, I'd recommend Bones and xxxtentacion. If you like Three 6 Mafia, check out $uicideboy$.
Man, those rappers have some pretty weird names.
Take my word for it man, you won't be disappointed.
Alright, I'll give them a chance. Any more rap recommendations?
Dude, I'll send you my Soundcloud on Facebook when I get home. I have a bunch of rap playlists you should check out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the video SUPER BASS by Nicki Minaj?
Yes, her lips match the drink.
She had green hair.
Probably competing with Gaga.
Did you see her necklace?
It was like water noodles.
She had a lot of muscle guys in the video.
They looked good.
I liked the motorcycle.
It was made of ice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw A Tribe Called Quest at FYF this year. They were incredible.
You did? I missed it! Low End Theory is one of my favorite albums.
Yeah, they were sick, even though Phife Dawg is gone now.
R.I.P. Phife man. That made me really sad!
Me too. But still, they really killed it. I was dancing my butt off when they dropped Left My Wallet in El Segundo.
That's one of my favorites too. I heard Missy Elliott was also really good.
Yeah, she was also pretty good. She played a lot of songs from The Cookbook.
My favorite album by her is Da Real World. So many classics on that one!
You should go next year, I heard De La Soul and the Pharcyde were jealous and wanted to do a back to back set.
Sick man! They should get The Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest again and really throw an amazing show!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any of Tech N9ne's new material?
No I haven't heard any of his material since K.O.D. Is it any good?
Oh man, his last record is really good! Definitely check it out!
Does it have any of his normal guest rappers in it?
Always! You know he can never not have Krizz Kaliko on his records!
Cool I really like Krizz's flow and style. Dude can sing too!
Yeah, they don't rap like the classics, but it's still really good.
Yeah man, Tech N9ne will be legend when he's done in the game.
Definitely! I'll let you borrow some of the new stuff next time I see you!
STRANGE MUSIC! Cool man!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rap song?
Oh that's easy, its Regulate by Warren G and Nate Dogg
Which one is that?
Oh its the one about two guys out for the evening - it has everything, ladies, armed robbery, car breakdowns, murder
Woah, thats a lot of stuff
Did those guy have any other hits?
Nope, not as far as I know.
Which, is kind of ok with me, I think listening to their other songs would ruin it for me.
Do they ever tour?
No, one of them died a few years ago - I cant remember which one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really can't stand violent rap lyrics.
I agree. Some of the older, fun rap is OK but the violent stuff is unsettling.
It's sickening that people view that as entertainment.
I agree. Some of the things said about women turn my stomach.
I never let my daughters listen to it.
My son tries to but I hate it.
I wouldn't let him.
I don't but he is getting older and does what he wants. I do tell him the things said about women upset me.
What does he say?
He says he doesn't agree with that violent stuff but then I wonder why he listens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Eminem your favorite rapper?
He's not my favorite but one of my top ones.
Whats your favorite song of his?
Rap god.
Why that one?
Well it really shows his maturity as he's gotten older and his skill especially his speed.
He is so incredibly fast in that song I don't know how he does it.
He is above everyone else in my opinion.
He's a lyrical genius if I've ever seen one.
So few of those today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Gucci Mane?
I can't stand his music.
Really? I don't think he's that bad.
I just think he's overrated. His lyrics are not very impressive
I could see how you'd feel that way. I think it's just meant to be party music.
A lot of rap is going in that direction. I like rap for the lyrics, though.
I agree. I feel like the days of storylines in rap are almost gone.
Yeah, it's sad too. I really enjoy music with a story.
It definitely feels more intellectual that way. I like both styles.
That's respectable. I wish I could get more interested in newer rap music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember thinking Chingy was really cute when I was a teenager.
I'm not sure if I know who he is.
He was pretty popular, do you remember the song "Right Thurr"?
Yes that was on the radio a lot!
"I like the way you do that right thurr...."
I loved that! My sister played it all the time.
He wasn't what I would call a classic but pretty good.
I agree. He was fairly talented.
I liked him. I can't remember a lot of his other music.
I know he collaborated with a few artists.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you feel about De La Soul?
I think they were OK not very big.
I think they were very influential in terms of hip hop.
Yeah I was not that big into them because I think they lacked a direction.
I think De La Soul is Dead was a superb album.
I didnt hear it in the tracks, I thought they were bland.
No way the artistic abilities in that album were second to none.
And what about the preceeding album?
3 Feet High and Rising was mediocre.
Most fans would argue your logic is flawed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love rap music.
Me too!  Although I'm much more partial to old rap music.
That is me as well.  I miss the days of Tupac and the Notorious BIG.
I was listening to Tupac when he was in Digital Underground!
Yeah, I remember them being in some movie in the 80s.
I remember that too.  It had Demi Moore and Chevy Chase in it.
It was called "Nothing but Trouble".
Yeah!  That's it!  Rap music today just isn't as good as it was.
Well now a days they just repeat certain words over and over again and put a beat behind it.  No real talent there.
You are so correct!  Thank God we know what real rap music sounds like!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about lil wayne?
He is one of the best rappers alive.
Why do you think that?
Lil wayne has a very long tenure in the game and he has produced great albums.
Which album do you like the best?
I really liked 'Tha Carter 2'
That was a great album.
Nothing better than that one.
Which mixtape did you like the most?
'The Drought' was a great classic album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like rap?
Yeah I like rap.
Who is your favorite rap artist of all time?
Man tough question.
Yeah.
I would say probably Rakim.
I don't know him.
He's one of the greats from back in the day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Jay-Z.
Is he your favorite rapper?
By far! The stories he tells in his songs are amazing.
What is your favorite track by him?
I think "Public Service Announcement" is my favorite.
Why do you say that?
I love his flow. I also love the way that he samples the speech in the beginning.
That track is great. But I prefer 99 Problems.
I love that track too. The beat is incredible.
I am always impressed by his instrumentals and beats.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rap artist?
I love Ludacris!
He's great isn't he?  I love "What's your Fantasy?"
I also like Little Wayne.  Hard to not want to dance around listening to him.
His song "Lollypop" is one of my favorites.  I always play it on my iPod.
How do you like Biggie?
He was so good.  So tragic that he had to die. Him and Tupac both!
I like that Puff Daddy wrote a song for Biggie.
Do you prefer the old school rap or the new stuff that's out there?
Both are good...I'm probably 50/50.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think Ice Cube and Ice T are sellouts?
Nah, just because they like money and acting doesn't make them sellouts.
I suppose you're right, if their acting careers totally sucked they'd be sellouts I suppose.
Of course I'm right.
All right, if they're not sellouts who is?
That's easy, Flavor Flave.
Oh wow you're right, between the roast and Flavor of Love it doesn't get much worse than that.
Again, of course I'm right.
He may have been a sellout, but he is still a living legend.
Yeah, you can't argue that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first get into hip-hop?
I remember listening to the rap they would play on MTV. I must have been about 9 or 10.
What were you listening to at that point?
Eminem is the main rapper I remember.
So when did you get into the underground stuff?
That happened when I was 12 I think. I had a friend who played Aesop Rock for me.
Oh, that's cool. What song did you hear first?
He played "Daylight" for me.
That's a classic. Probably Aesop's best song.
Yeah, that song still holds up really well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Do you listen to a lot of rap?
Well I don't know about a lot, but I listen to some.
What kind of rap do you like?
I like rap that has a lot of great writing in it.
Like lyrics and rhymes?
Yeah.
Why do you like that?
I like that it makes me think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the guy that had the song Wild Thing?
I think it was Tone Loc.
Yeah, that was it!
What was his other song?
Funky Cold Medina?
Yeah, that was it.
Didn't he have a weird voice?
I don't know if it was weird, but it was distinguished.
Yeah, that's what I meant.  He had a deep voice.
Yeah, you definately knew it was him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rappers are you into?
I am into SZA.
Oh cool, I have never heard of them.
Yeah she is talented.
What songs do you recommend?
I like the songs supermodel and love galore.
Oh cool, I will make a note to listen to them.
Please do, you will not be dissapointed.
It was great talking to you!
Same to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
which rapper do you think is the most like tupac
I would Have to say Boosie
boosie what makes you say that
because the type of heart felt music he makes
i dont think hes even close to tupac
boosie has b een around for a long time and has put in alot of work
maybe i have to go back and check some of his stuff out
yea i will have to put you up on it
what songs should i check for
songs like going through some things i know you woul feel that
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, this guy Marshall Bruce Mathers III, does he really do hip-hop?
You mean Eminem? Yes he does.
But he's white.
Yes he is, and from outside Detroit, more or less. Yet he's had 10 number one hip-hop albums so far.
I didn't know.
His hip-hop film 8 Mile was praised by most critics, and was a commercial success too. Critics rated it 76% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.
Okay, people liked his movie presence in 8 Mile, but how was the music?
He won a Best Song Academy Award for Lose Yourself, in 8 Mile.
But does he really connect his his audience?
Yes. He appeals to almost anyone who eally listens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is rap and hip-hop the same thing?
Not at all. They are related but not the same.
How so?
Rap is a genre of music characterized by spoken word sprinkled rhythmically over a beat. Hip-hop is a culture that involves rap.
A music culture right?
Yes, but not only is hip hop considered music, it's a state of mind, okay. The way you dress, talk, party, emote, all of it is hip-hop.
So I can be hip-hop without a single song playing. Like, in total silence.
Exactly. Rap, however can't exist without a beat and lyrics.
So if I'm wearing Phat Farm clothing in total silence, I can be hip-hop?
Right, but you can't rap until you open your mouth and spit some bars over a beat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been listening to rap music lately?
Yeah I have been listening to Tyga.
What song?
Ice Cream man.
Oh interesting.
Have you heard of it.
Yeah I heard it but I really do not like that song. It isn't my cup of tea.
That is understandable.
The only song I like by him is the one he did with Kylie.
That song is catchy as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey what's up.
Not much.
Cool.
Are you into rap at all?
Yeah I listen to a lot of rap.
Who's your favorite rapper right now?
It usually goes between a lot of people, but right now it's Kendrick Lamar.
I hear people talk about him a lot, but I haven't listened to him.
You should listen to some of his songs, great lyricist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the 1st rao song you can remember.
for me it was the song that raped about bad food at a party.
That was Rapper's Delight by The Sugarhill Gang.
Yes that was in 1979 and I remember that the album had a candy like label on it.
That was a classic rap song.
Now I remember a rap called the revoloution will not be televised.
Yes that was Gilbert "Gil" Scott-Heron
I concider him the firest rapper.
He was before my time but I would have to say the first rap was the mack.
Yes everything he said was considered  rap in the early 70's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What song made you fall in love with hiphop music?
I would have to say Microphone Fiend.
Oh, that's a classic Rakim hit for sure.
I fell in love with the video when i was a kid.
Yeah it was dope, especially the little 7 year old running around rocking the mic.
What song made you a hip-hop lover?
I don't have a particular song but Slick Rick did it for me.
He was a fantastic storyteller wasn't me?
I would have to say Slick Rick and Notorious B.I.G are my top two storyteller emcees.
Would have been cool to hear them both on a song together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rap group of all time?
It's most def the Wu Tang Clan. Whats your's?
Thats a good one! I like Outkast and D12 but I can not decide.
Yeah that is a tough one! I'd say Outkast just because Eminem basically carried D12 and they did not make too many albums.
Yeah you have a good point there! I guess I would say Outkast then.
Well whats your favorite song from Outkast?
I would say "Back of the Bus". Whats your favorite Wu tang song?
There are so many good ones its hard to say but If I had to guess off the top of my head it would be C.R.E.A.M.
Now that is a striaght classic!
Yes sir, cash rules every thing around me! Cream get the money, dollar dollar bills yall!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any rap artists?
I do like some rap, but don't know who it is i'm hearing most of the time, i just know i like it
Yeah, i get that. Tupac's one of my favorites.
Yeah, he was a cool dude. It was sad when he got killed.
For sure. I also like DMX
I've heard the name but i know so little rap music i couldn't identify him by song or picture!
That's cool. It's not a contest, I was just wondering
haha. I do like it though, i've just never made a habit of listening so i don't get to know the artists
Right.
I think partially cause it wasn't a big thing when i was growing up so i never got in the habit. Probably if i grew up in a younger generation I would know more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, do you like rap and hip-hop or not? I've been thinking lately that it still gets a bad reputation.
No, I definitely like it. It totally depends on the style though--I'm not into really violent imagery.
Yeah, I totally agree--but it's important to remember that with the good stuff, that imagery serves a purpose.
Oh no, definitely--I just don't want it to feel cheap or unnecessary, you know?
Have you listened to Kendrick Lamar yet? I know that's an obvious one, but he's just great.
Ha--of course I have! He's great. He's an exception to that for sure.
You know who he reminds me of? Atmosphere. It's really sentimental but also hard and intense, you know what I mean?
For sure. You grew up in Seattle, do you like Blue Scholars?
Yeah, I love their shtick! It's a great take on the love-of-hometown theme.
Of course, everyone needs some Nicki Minaj too--can't forget the ladies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into rap music
Yeah I am. You
Yes I really like Kendrick Lamar
He's very innovative
What's your favorite song
The one he did with a$ap Rocky
Was it called problems?
Yes that's the one.
Him and a$ap could collaborate more.
I think they're coming out with new music soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think of Meek Mill?
He gets some bad press but I think he's one of the best lyricists out there.
I agree. I haven't found an album by him that I don't like.
I get a sense of realness from him. I believe he's lived what he raps about.
Definitely. He's really believable.
"Dreams and Nightmares" is one of the best club songs ever.
My jaw was on the floor the first time I heard that song.
When the beat switches, it's so intense.
That whole album is really good.
I only listen to maybe five songs off of it. They're all good, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I dont like current rap music
Me either
It's so repetitive.
Exactly
Like that song black and yellow
It gets on my nerves so bad
Mine too
And that is most songs are like these days
Exactly
They suck
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the first Hip Hop rap hit?
I think it's "Rappers Delight" by the Sugarhill Gang.
Did you know that singer "Angie Stone" was one of the original members?
Get out! But you know that "Good Times" song is used as the hook in Rappers Delight?
Oh snap, no I didn't.
What year did "Rappers Delight" come out?
It was late 1979. I remember because that was the year I first heard "Foxy's" "Get Off!"
Is that the same year the rap record "Don't Push Me Cause I'm Close To The Edge" came out?
No, that song came out much later.
"Rappers Delight" must be your favorite rap song since you know so much about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like Rap?
Yeah it's okay.
Not a big fan?
No I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I know some stuff.
Do you have a favorite rap artist?
That would probably be Anderson Paak.
I don't know of him?
He's great you should give him a listen.  He raps and sings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite rap artist
Eminem definitely
He's good
Yea i haven't heard him in forever though
Me either
I have his cds though
I think i have one of them
I like listening to them

You should
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who you don't hear a lot about anymore?
Who would that be?
Ol' Dirty Bastard. He was semi popular back in the 90's.
Can you remind me what his songs were?
He rapped that song called "Shimmy Shimmy Ya".
That doesn't ring a bell actually but I do remember the song "Back in the Game."
I think I know that one!
Didn't he rap along with Wu Tang Clan also?
I do believe you are right.
He rapped a few songs with them if I remember correctly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about Kanye West's song Famous?
I love Taylor Swift and I think he really was rude to her.
Okay I don't think that at all I think that Taylor Swift is lucky Kanye even reffered to her. Like he's the best rapper of this generation.
Okay him saying " I mad that bitch famous" was so disrespectful!"
That's just dramatic, he is rap gold. His lyric "But we still hood famous, Yeah we still hood famous." Like he came from the streets to build his empire.
I guess that is true,I don't know I just wish Rap wasn't so vulgar.
Well yeah we want to filter the world but thats not how the world is.
I don't know I just am very conservative.
Yeah I can obviously tell,you just need to lighten up.
I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to hear the new Kendrick Lamar?
Yes I did, I thought it was mediocre.
I dont feel that way to be honest with you.
What was the best parts of it then?
I thought the songs really were varied.
As far as lyrics?
His lyrics are always just like that but I loved his use of genres of music.
He is a crossover artist in my opinion
I liked how he used one word for every album title.
To me that was just a bit corny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rap music
Yeah I dabble in it. Whos your favorite artist
I'm a fan of Biggie Smalls
Oh! I loved Hypnotized when it first came out. I even bought the CD
Thats a good song, Big Poppa is better though
what album is that on
I'm not sure of the original album, but its on his greatest hits album from 2007
I'll have to buy it so I can listen to more of his stuff
If you get the chance, try to listen to Juicy too. Its a fun track
I'll do that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have  you heard much  from Lupe  ?
I heard  his  Lazerz   track  which is  good .
the  whole  cd is well put  together .
how    many  tracks  are there ?
there  are only  10 tracks  but they all  have a  message
Would  you  go see  him in  concert?
I think  he would  put on  a great  show  .
Who  would  you  compare  to lyrically ?
I would  compare  him  to  bone  thugs
I might  just  have to  listen  to  more of  his  stuff
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like old school rap or the newer rap that is out now?
Nothing beats old school rap but there are a few new artists that I can respect.
Do you think rap lyrics are better or worse now?
I believe they are worse and should rap about better topics.
Do you like fast rap or slow rap?
I like fast rap because it is challenging to rap and learn the lyrics.
Do you like gangsta rap better then any other genre?
yes but I also enjoy a little bit of everything.
Where do you think Tupacs rap style would be if he were still alive?
I think he would be into world topics.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Can I borrow your copy of Malice n Wonderland? I've been on a real Snoop Dogg kick lately.
For shizzle my nizzle. haha Yeah, its not problem.
Great thank you.
No problem. You know, I just found out that Snoop is a moderator on Reddit,
Really? What sub is he on?
He's one of the mods on r/trees.
Oh, that's not surprising at all.
Apparently, he's actually really active in the Reddit community.
I didn't know that! I'm going to have to look him up.
You should. He participates in gift exchanges and everything
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Public Enemy monumental in changing rap?
They did more for rap than any other group.
I tend to agree with you.
What was your favorite album?
Fear of a Black Planet
Yeah thats mine too.
How about your favorite artist in the group?
Chuck D by a mile.
I liked Flavor Flav
I think he was too geeky if that even makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that Mos Def jam Ms Fat Booty?
Good song. Can you believe that came out almost 20 years ago?
Don't remind me. I still play that album all the time.
Yeah, but that song was definitely the stand out song on the album.
It's one of my favorites, but I still like UMI Says best.
That song is really uplifting and sweet. Makes me miss my grandmother.
No doubt. I think of that song as a gift.
Everything Mos Def does is a gift to the world.
It's hard to argue with that. Artists like him are way too rare.
That's why we're still listening all these years later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you planning on checking out the new DJ Khaled album?
Not really.
Why not?
He seems to only work with newer artists. I don't know any of them.
That's not true. He's got songs with Nas, Fat Joe, and Raekwon on the new album.
That's a pleasant surprise.
And either way, his music with the newer artists isn't bad.
Who else has he worked with.
He's done songs with guys like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake. All solid rappers.
Alright, then. I'll give them a chance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper?
I like Tupac, he's the best of all time
I like Tupac too, but I like Lil Wayne more.
What's Lil Wayne's best song?
I like A Milli, but some people hate it
Why do they hate it?
It has a repetive beat
That's how a lot of songs are though, its not bad
What's your favorite song from Tupac?
I really like California Love
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this beat is sick
What beat?
I am making my own rap beat
You need to let me help you
You think i dont got this?
nah you do but more help is always good
I guess
Trust me man we can collab
Well that would be cool
Yeah bro
XXXXXXXXXXX
hamilton was the best thing for hip hop in years, i swear
what's hamilton?
it's a musical
that's not hip hop, then!
oh, but it is. it's an entire musical of hip hop and rap
okay, sounds kind of legit. what's it about?
the founding fathers
pass. that sounds boring
you'd think it's boring, but when it's set to a killer soundtrack and featuring a bunch of poc pretending to be white guys?
okay, i'm in
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for that new Jay-Z album?
Of course I am! You?
Yes, but man is getting old.
Hov is a genius, old age is wisdom gained for him.
I just hope Hov doesn't come through with that Uzi flow.
Yeah, he's too old for that!
Plus I heard that No ID is producing the whole thing.
Oh wow, that's dope!
Yes, so we should be in good hands!
No ID wouldn't steer Hov in the wrong direction.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper from Atlanta
Easy, I would say Ludacris.
Why Ludacris?
His lyrics and flow was awesome.
True, I think he was way ahead of his time.
I agree, he was from ATL bad has an New York flow.
I think he is very underrated.
That is not an understatement, he never got the credit he deserves.
Why didn't he get the credit he deserves?
I think it was because he was a south rapper in an era of a lot of rappers from New York.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite hip-hop artist that haven't made it big in the mainstream yet?
Yeah, one of them is that boy Grafh from Queens.
I never heard of him. Does he have an album i could listen to online?
He has plenty of work online. Try Pain Killers and Pain Killers Reloaded.
I'm a check him out on my free time. You ever heard of Nino Man?
Yeah, i heard him on Hot 97 with Funk Master Flex.
He rapped his heart out that day on the radio.
Yeah he did for sure. Hope he gets to drop a mainstream album soon.
He is working with Jadakiss so hopefully he could get his foot in the door.
Nino Man just released a mixtape a few days ago called Better Late Than Never. It has some nice tracks on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rapper
I love Tupac
Why him? Aren't there better people
His music was revolutionary and started a new wave in rap
Oh I see, its a shame he died though

California Love really stuck with me

The beat is really good and I love driving to it
XXXXXXXXXXX

What sort of things does Rick Ross rap about?
He raps about a variety of things. Sometimes he raps about women, cars, clothes, money, drugs, and more.
Is he from the United States?
He is! He is from a town called Clarksdale.
Are there a lot of famous rappers from that town?
I don't think so. I think he is one of very few from the town.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Busta Rhymes?
Yeah, He had some good stuff.
I remember hearing him as a kid. He was good.

Do you still listen to him?
No

Genesis
