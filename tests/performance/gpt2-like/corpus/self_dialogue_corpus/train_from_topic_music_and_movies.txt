I wondered if he's still alive.
Who Ayers? Or Fox? or Downey Jr?
Ayers! There's supposed to be a foundation dedicated to that gifted people with mental illness thing.
You know what people say about this movie?
Um.. I reckon they say a lot about the movie.
yes, But in particular, they say it's a typical White Savior narrative.
That is NOT a thing. A white savior narrative? That can't be a thing.
ON the contrary. it IS a thing. And people categorize this movie precisely in that.
So if a white person helps a black person and if it's portrayed as a medium, then it's a White Savior narrative.
Yep. And the movie fits that perfectly.
The movie does or the real life does? This actually happened, so to belittle it calling it a white savior narrative isn't really fair.
Fair, Not fair. I'm just telling you what people think.
Who wrote the cello for the soundtrack anyway?
Some Italian composer guy. Marianelli.
That's not some italian guy. He's the one who composed the soundtrack for the atonement.
Well, he did win the Oscars's for the best score. But he's still an Italian guy.
You said some italian guy, liek he's not that important.
I did say that, but that doesn't mean I don't think he's important. io just mean he's some italian guy which is what he is.
An italian vs some italian. There is a difference. Anyway, I love that track. Atonement. What's that movie about anyway?
Atonement? I guess... the process of atoning. That might have something to do with it. just a guess though. I haven't seen it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any parallels in music or movies for you?
What do you mean?
Like, criteria that makes you like something.
That applies to both music and movies?
Sure. What's the "catch" for you personally?
Themes, tone, and overall honesty of the work.
Any examples?
Sure. I'd say that Paul Thomas Anderson seems to have control over his work creativey, amongst other things.
What about the other stuff you mentioned?
He's a good example. His humor can be broad, sometimes dark. I like that about him.
What else?
His stuff has a lot of depth emotionally, and he's good with ensembles that work together.
Where does the parallel with music come in?
I like bands that have themes like what I mentioned, and even some of those like, say, Morrissey, have a sense of humor.
I see. He can be cheeky despite the overall gloominess.
It's like one of those satires like Office Space. They're making fun of something, but something that's really frustrating for many if not most people.
Right. Even something more outlandish within pop music can be that way, as well.
Exactly! Jobs like that suck, but they point it out so cleverly on so many levels. Bands have done that for more than a few decades.
With varying tones, too. It can be fascinating.
Yeah. Must be an endless supply of lyrics about these topics at this point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Mike, how've you been?
Alright, I've been busy.
What you been doing?
Working and spending time with the family.
What do you guys do together?
We watched Aladdin the other night.
That's a classic.
My kids love it.
Mine do as well.
The genie is so funny.
It's a shame about Robin Willliams though.
Yeah. He was a great entertainer.
The music in that movie is great.
My kids like to sing the songs.
It's got some great action scenes.
I like when the cave comes to life.
They chase the princess through the streets as well.
Jasmin is amazing.
It's a great story.
Disney did a good job.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like music or movies better?
I like movies more
Me too, they are easier to talk about
Yes they are
Do you have a favorite genre of movies?
Comedy is my favorite
I like comedy too
A couple of my favorite actors are robin Williams and Jim carry
I love their movies.
Me too, the mask is on of my favorites.
That's a good one.
Yea, I also love Mrs doubtfire
That one is funny
I watched it on TV the other day
I wish he was still making movies.
Me too
He was a classic
There will never be another actor like him
Everyone loved him I wonder why he was so depressed
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, how are you?
Quite well, just got back from an Umphrey's McGee show. Those guys are awesome.
Who?
They're a jam band that plays a lot of progressive rock. You've never heard of them?
No, I haven't. Tell me more about them.
Well they tour a whole lot and they have a great sound and an amazing light show.
Light show? Like Pretty Lights?
No man, not at all. They actually play instruments.
Do they play them well?
Of course! They're rock stars.
I'll have to check them out.
You really should. They're my favorite band.
What other music do you like?
I'm really into the Grateful Dead. What about you?
I love indie rock. My favorite band is Arcade Fire.
They're the ones that did that song "Reflektor" right?
Yeah, that was on their newest album. I prefer their old stuff though.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
I know it's cliche, but "Wake Up" is an amazing tune.
I know that one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude. Check out this trailer.
Wow, cars really has gotten dark.
I know right? Its really violent.
And whats up with the music? Did they really have to use dubstep?
I dont know, I think it kind of works.
Really, you think this fits a kids movie?
This isnt a kids movie anymore.
I weep for the youth of our future. The first one was so good and cute!
This is something brand new, better even.
I dont know if explosions mean better.
Oh come now, explosions make everything better.
But the techno music?
Necessary. its the gritty future!
I miss the gritty past.
You are too nostalgic.
What can I say, im a dreamer.
Are you doing to go see it? I'll be there opening day.
Really? This garbage?
Yeah, i am ordering tickets right now.
Count me out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm doing good, you?
Good, did you have a good weekend?
Yeah, me and the wife went to see a movie.
Which one?
The new fast and furious one
Oh, The Fate of the Furious?
Yeah, it was awesome.
That's the one where Charlize Theron is the new bad guy, right?
Yeah, she's great in it.
It's one of my favorites of the series.
Mine too, what's your favorite part?
When they are being chased by the submarine through Russia.
Oh yeah, there's some great action scenes.
What about yours?
When Jason Statham's character takes on the entire plane while keeping an eye on the baby.
He's such a great actor in the movie.
Yeah, he kicks a lot of butt.
Well, it was nice talking to you.
You too, have a great day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the thing you hate most about movies?
Going to them.
So you dont like the theater experience?
I would rather do it in my home.
I think the ambiance is great.
I just am not into special effects.
Do you watch movies that have them?
Yes and no.
Can you elaborate?
I am not a huge adventure fan
What about comic movies?
They have them but the storyline is more important to me.
Would you consider paying the same price at home?
No because I dont have the requisite screen for the theater.
So would you pay half to watch a new movie at home
Yes that seems fair.
The movies are the best part of seeing a movie.
Just does nothing for me.
How about if it was a musical?
The loudness of the theater is bothersome
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how are you?
I'm good, have you heard any good music?
I was just listen to halsey in the car
I like her, she was great in that song with the Chainsmokers.
She was, that's how I first heard of her.
I dont know where she came from
Me either, do you like the chainsmokers?
Yes I do
They sound great
Do you like country?
I listen to it from time to time.
I enjoy it, I love older country
Like John Michael montgomery?
Yes and Garth brooks, Brooks and dunn, Joe diffy
Garth Brooks is pretty good, I like his friends In low places sing.
I also like lonestar
Haven't heard anything from them in a while
No, I haven't, that's too bad
They are talented.
Definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey!
Hey!
We haven't talked in forever.
I know, right?
What have you been up to?
Listening to music, watching movies, housework, video games, keeping my son from getting into trouble.
What have you been watching?
Well... I saw Moana at the cheap theater.
Oh, did you like it.
I liked it better after renting it from the library.
Why's that?
I couldn't catch most of the words in the "You're Welcome" or "Shiny" songs because of the way they were performed.
Ah yes, you watch movies with subititles on.
Yep, I actually do like both of those songs now, but really couldn't follow them in the theater.
Kind of wrecks the experience when you can understand the words.
Yeah, I wish there was a subtitles option at theaters.
Hey, I went to a theater in Nebraska that had that option.
Really?
Yeah, it wasn't a main line theater though, just a community one.
Oh, well there goes hoping that a chain was starting a trend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bud! What have you been up to?
Oh nothing much, just slaving away at work.
I hear you there. Do you have any plans for the weekend?
Not really. I guess I'll just stay at home and watch movies.
Yeah, that's one of my favorite ways to unwind too. What are you going to watch?
I have no clue. I'm hoping to find a series to binge on.
Do you have Hulu or Netflix?
I have both.
I have been watching a really good series on Hulu if you're interested.
Heck yes!
It's called the Handmaid's Tale.
I think I have heard of that.
It's a book too. There is an old movie based on the book as well.
What's it about?
It's about a world where fertile women are gathered up and used to reproduce, regardless of their wants and needs.
Sounds creepy!
It really is disturbing! What do you say we get together and watch the movie Sunday? I haven't seen it yet.
Sounds like a plan!
Cool. Why don't you come over to my house around 2 pm?
Great! I'll bring the popcorn!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that movie about that cellist genius?
Um. That's so descriptive. Was it a documentary? About Yoyo Ma?
No it was, um.. about this black guy.
That's not exactly the usual racial profile of a cellist
That sounds racist, but whatever. Anyway this dude was like a genius or something.
I think I know. But I'll let you remember if you can. Can you, you know, remember things?
of course I can. it's right at the tip of my tongue...
The... cellists... play... what?
What? Cello... No, that's not what I mean.
No I mean, the cellist play solo music?
Yes of course.
So... it stands to say that a cellist can be a what?
Doh!. The Soloist! That's the movie.
Ding Ding Ding. Yes. With Jamie Fox as Nathaniel Ayers
That's the genius dude! Ayers. Apparently he goes crazy while in music school or something.
Well, he was attending Julliard as a double bassist And then he had to be institutionalized. treated with electroconovulsive therapy etc.
Those will mess you up more than help you.
So he wasn't really a genius, talented yes, but a genius? Hardly.
But anyway the movie was pretty good.
i thought it was ok. Not that great. but the problem of gifted people with mental illnesses is quite interesting. Like, are they more prone to mental illnesses? Why do artists commit suicides at so much higher rate than the general public? It's interesting to say the least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
What's up
Nothing, what about you?
Listening to Sam hunt on the radio
Oh cool, what song?
Body like a back road
Oh I love that song
Me too
It has a really catchy tune
And a great beat
I turn up the radio whenever it comes on
Me too
Do you listen to country a lot?
Yes I love it
Me too, one of my favorites is Miranda lambert
I love the gunpowder and led song
Shes edgy
Yes she is
That's part of what makes her great.
I agree with that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I haven't seen you in ages, how have you been?
Not too bad, just got back from my vacation.
Awesome, did you do anything fun?
I did, yes.  I spent a lot of time at the movie theater.
Did you see anything good?
Yes, I did.  I absolutely loved the new Guardians Of Galaxy movie.
Oh cool.  I've heard really good things about it.
It was really good, I saw it twice.
It's a sequel, right?
Yes, the first one came out a couple of years ago.
I remember watching that one, I think I liked it.
You should check this one one, I think you'll like it.
Oh, why's that?
It has more of an emotional story line.  It's easier to get involoved with the plot.
Hmm... I might have to go see it this weekend.
You should, I was actually thinking about seeing it again.
Wow, that good, huh?
Yes!  You should see it in IMAX 3D, it is so much better that way.
Ok.  Is there anywhere around here that shows that?
Yes, there are a few theaters the next town over that do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, how's it going?
Good dude, what's up with you?
Oh, nothing much, just starting out my summer break
That's cool. Any big plans?
Some trips and then I want to get caught up on some good movies.
Yeah, that sounds like a plan. What movies are you going to see?
I want to see the new Baywatch movie
Oh I hear that's horrible
Oh whatever, it has gorgeous girls in bathing suits in it.
Yeah, but sometimes not even that can overcome bad acting
But it also has the Rock in it. He's a good actor
Oh please.
He was good in Fast and Furious
Oh come on now. That was so campy
No, I thought he did a good job
No way, those movies are horrible
Are you kidding?! They're great
No way man. The plots are full of holes
Well we'll have to agree to disagree on this one
Okay fine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Homeward Bound?
No. what's it about?
Three pets trying to find their family.
Is it animated?
No.  Its got real animals.
Cool!  What kind?
Two dogs and a cat.
What kind of cat?
A Himalayan cat.
Those are beautiful.
I agree. I wish I had one.
What kinds of dogs?
One is a golden retriever.
What's his name?
His name is Shadow.
What's the others name?
He is a bull dog named Chance.
Cool. Do they get home?
Yes. After a huge journey they do.
Cool. I want to watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard the movie has some great effects?
Yea for sure. The graphics were great and the actors were amazing
Have you also watch the new pirates of the carribeans movie?
Not yet but I am watching that on Friday!
Me too! I can't wait to see captain jack go at it again
I have been a big fan of johnny depp since his first movie
Same here. I literally watched every single one of his work
Do you like Disney movies as well?
Of course. One of my favorites is Moana that they launched recently
The plot of that movie was amazing.
I also really liked the musics they had in the. Movie
Yea I think they are organizing a singalong pretty soon too
Oh really do you when it is going to be?
Not too sure but I will find out and let you know.
Do you recommend any other movies coming out?
I think cars is making a 3rd movie and is coming out this summer
Oh I heard about that I will definitely check that out
Have you watched all the previous movies?
I have and I really enjoyed it
Me too I will definitely check the new movie out
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you listen to while drunk?
The same thing that everyone does.
Which is?
Classical music with tons of brass, percussion, dissonance, and chromatic harmonies.
Umm, I don't agree with that.
No really, I enjoy it and analyze and appreciate it more when tipsy.
Why do you think that is?
Probably because my mind is open more and I hear things I hadn't before. What about you?
Teen pop music with female singers.
Seriously? You're a 35 year old male.
Yeah, I know.
Ok, who specifically?
Well, I subscribe to Katy Perry, Sia, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Lady Gaga to start.
Some of them are pretty talented.
Some?
Well, neither Katy nor Selena can really go full-on when live, and Ariana's voice is a bit too light.
True on Ariana, that's why she wasn't good in Hairspray.
I like Sia as her voice carries forever.
I'll try your drunk classical. Recommend me something?
Shostakovich Symphony no. 10, movements 2 and 4.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new album from MGK?
MGK? What does that mean?
Machine Gun Kelly
Oh. I do not listen to much hip hop. Is it good?
Yes! I would reccommend it even if you are not a fan.
Where is he from?
Cleveland, OH. Are you familiar with artists from that area?
Not quite. Are there are good features on the album?
Halliee Steinfield is the only one.
How is the song?
Really good! It's actually on the radio.
Oh! I'm very surprised I haven't heard it yet.
What music do you listen to if you do not like hip hop.
I prefer heavy metal, actually.
Oh, ok. Who is your favorite band?
In Flames. Have you heard of them?
Yes, actually! My favorite album is Reroute to Remain.
Mine too! I cannot believe we have that in common.
It is surely a different tune than what we hear in hip hop.
Agreed! What a coincidence!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there
Hi, how have you been?
Fine thanks
What about you?
I´m on vacations, so I´m watching a lot of movies
Wich ones have you seen so far
The Excorcist, all Harry Potter´s movies, Lord of the rings, each and every one

You should, now that you have the time
I´m not really into those type of movies
so what other movies are you planning to watch
well I am going to change category, I will start watchin comedy
You should watch all JIm Carrey's  movies the
I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there! How's it going?
I'm pretty good, how about you?
Great! I've had the last couple days off from work.
That's awesome, have you been up to anything fun?
My boyfriend and I went to a concert last week in the city.
Oh, cool. Which one?
We saw Adele live. It was amazing.
Wow, that's awesome, I heard she's not going to be touring much anymore.
I know! We had a chance to get the tickets, and couldn't pass it up.
Were the seats expensive?
Ummm, we probably paid more than we should have.
Good seats though?
Yes, definitely! About 10 rows back from the front.
I'm so jealous! Did she sing "Hello"?
Yes! Pretty much all of her songs that you've heard on the radio, and some new stuff that I didn't recognize.
That sounds so cool. I wish I could've gone too!
Are there any concerts you wanted to see this summer?
I'm big into country music, so maybe one of those tours when they come to town.
That'd be awesome, you should let me know if you're going to buy tickets!
Will do! It was great catching up with you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi how are you?
Good, nice to meet you.
have you seen the new Twin Peaks?
Yes it's amazing!
David Lynch is out of his mind.
Totally. Do you think David Bowie filmed any scenes before he died?
I don't know, I read he might have.
But here's the big question: Dougie. Love or hate?
Hate, so cheesy.
I know, right!
It's a terrible way to treat Cooper/Dougie.
I thought he would snap out of it when he drank coffee.
Me too!
That would have been funny.
The glass box was cool.
very cool.
I can't wait for sunday.
the last two weeks feels longer than the 25 years since it was on.
exactly.
I'm glad it is good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, there I was thinking about going and seeing a movie. Would you like to go?
I have not been to a movie in years. They are to expensive.
I know they are expensive sometimes but I like to go to a matinee because they are cheaper.
That might be an option.
I also like to go to matinee's because there are normally fewer people.
That sounds like a great reasons to go to matinees.
What kind of movie would you liek to go see?
I like all kinds of movies except horror type ones.
I see there are several that I would like to go to. Maybe you can help narrow it down a bit,.
I definatly do not want to go see any romance type drama movies this time around.
I found Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Which one sounds better to you?
I have not seen Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Is there any other options besides Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales?
What about The Fate of the Furious or King Arthur: Legend of the Sword? I really like period pieces.
Now that is a hard decision to make between all three movies. I also like period pieces.
If we are going to go see King Arthur: Legend of the Sword during a matinee time it looks like it is only showing at 3:05pm today. Does that work for you?
I am not sure I can do that today. is it showing tomorrow around the same time? If it is I can do it tomorrow.
They have it at either 3:25 or 4.30 tomorrow. Which time works best for you?
I would like to go to the later one at  4.30 tomorrow.
Sounds great! I will meet you at my house at 3:45pm so we can go together to the movie.
Sound good to me. See you tomorrow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how is it going?
It is okay but could be better.
Yea I know the feeling.
I wish there was some sort of pill to make all the troubles go away.
Oh I know right that would be sweet.
Yea like from that movie limitless it was awesome.
Yea I seen that movie it was pretty good.
Yea it was I am a big movie guy how about you?
I am i love movies I am a big star wars buff.
Cool Star Wars is awesome have you seen the new one that just came out.
Do you mean Rogue One.
Yea thats the one it was freaking awesome with the asian guy and the staff who was blind.
Oh yea he was so bad ass he was definitely using the force.
So did you like the movie sound track?
Of course man Star Wars music is my jam.
So what other types of music do you like.
I like anything rock related like grunge alternative punk metal they are all great.
Nice I love the same kind of music I cant stand to listen to rap it is horrible.
Oh i know always about the same stuff never changes.
Okay man good talking to you it has been fun but I have to go I will talk to you soon tho maybe get lunch take care.

What? Aren't those guy commies?
Well, yeah. But they make goofd music.
Good propaganda music, more like.
Not really! They sing, like, folk songs and stuff.
Are you sure? because they sound like a propaganda orchestra to me.
Sure I'm sure, a lot of their songs pre-date the communist revolution anyway.
Well, if you say so. And yeah, I've never listened to them.
Well you should give them a listen.
Honestly, I think I'll pass.
Suit yourself then.
Listen to anything else?
Sexualizer.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I got these tickets to see Batman vs Superman. Wanna go with me?
Oh yes! I have been dying to see it. I'll call you after work.
Movies are half off this weekend! Any ideas of what you wanna see?
I heard Captain America Civil War is really good. How about that one?
Yeah, I haven't see that yet. I'm totally down for it.

Hey so it's summer time.
Yes?
You know what that means?
Um, not really
Movies!!!
Oh, well yeah. If you like crap movies.
No way man. The Alien convent movies looks awesome.
Yeah no. They sucked after the 2nd one.
Ah man, I didn't think so.
Well I do.
You didn't like the one where they resurrected Ripley from the dead
I never saw that one
Oh, it's great man. You have to check it out.
I watched Alien 3 and was thoroughly disappointed.
Well yeah that one is pretty bad, but this new one is supposed to be really good.
I don't know. I don't like wasting money on bad movies.
I think you'd like this one.
Well, maybe. What time?
10 pm and the valley cinema.
Okay, I'll join you for this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You studied music in college, right?
Yes, I have a few degrees in it.
What were your favorite- and least-favorite courses?
SO many favorites, but I'd have to choose Advanced Analysis.
Why is that?
It introduced me to higher-level theory as an undergrad and really opened my eyes to alternative interpretations and how to use mathematical systems to understand music.
WOW. That sounds like a lot.
It was, and the graduate-level courses for it, like transformational and set theories, are insane.
What about your least favorite?
Well, I have two.
And they are?
Aesthetics and The Science of Music.
You seem like you'd like The Science of Music. Why was it bad?
Well, it was mostly just studying properties of sound waves, rather than interesting things like acoustics. It was a let-down.
I see, that would bug me too. What about aesthetics?
I hated that class to death because it's all philosophy. You know I can't read that crap.
It's not crap, but I understand.
Plus, the professor was awful to me.
How so?
Well, not awful TO me, just that I couldn't follow him. I could never understand his ways of thinking and his mannerisms.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what is up

Sing.
Never heard of it.
It's airly new... and a kid's movie.
Oh, really? Wouldn't that be weird for two adults to go to a kid's event?
Well the advertisement doesn't say anything about that!
Ok, then! I do still love kid's movies.
Me too! I still watch the Rudolph classics on TV every Christmas.
Me too! And I always have to watch Home Alone.
Classic. Did you ever watch the sequel?
Yeah, just the first one.
There's more than one?
Yeah, they built on the Home Alone empire! All the other one's are pretty bad though.
I bet.
I don't even think they went to the theaters. Straight for TV movies are always a flop!
XXXXXXXXXXX

Hell yeah, I hope it will be good
Me to, Batman vs Superman was just ok
I likes it at first, but got worse each time I watched it.
They need to take a page from Mavel's book
I know, they hit a grand slam every time.
I think they may be bringing the JLA together to fast
That's what I think
Marvel took their time and developed each character individually first
and DC is just jumping right in
I think It may be a big mistake
I hope not, I love the Justice League
Superman has always been my favorite character of all time
I can't believe they had Batman kick his ass
I was so pissed at that.  There are over 1000 ways Superman could beat batman without getting close to him
It is such bullshit
I hope they have good writers for this movie
They have a lot riding on it so hopefully they took there timd
They need to let the guys who write the animated series do the movie
There cartoons are much better than their movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey remember the Finding Nemo movie? The one with the fish?
Yeah, it's an old movie. I remember watching that as a kid. It's a good one, though.
Yeah, well. They made a Finding DORY movie.
Finding Dory? About the blue fish that has bad memory?
Yes! Let's go see it tonight!
I can't tonight, let's go tomorrow.
I am such a Star Wars fan. I want to go see the new Star War's movie!
I kind of want to see it too. I heard the graphics are simply amazing.
Cool, let's buy some tickets for tomorrow night and we can go see it together.
That sounds like a great plan! Be ready at 4.
Do you know any good movies playing for kids right now? My nephew's birthday is this weekend!
Movies for kids? Well, Zootopia is a great movie for kids.
Zootopia huh? I heard some good things about that movie. Do you think my nephew would like to see it?
Oh yes definitely! Even Shakira plays in that movie!
Really? Well, I guess I know what I'm going to do for his birthday now!
My girlfriend wants to go to the movies for our anniversary.
Oh? That sounds like fun! What are you guys gonna see?
That's the problem! I have no idea!
Well she likes the super hero movies right? Why not take her to go see Ant Man?
She might like that. I'll probably end up seeing it with her. I'll let you know what I decide on, okay? Thanks for the help!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new "Pirates" movie?
No, I've not. You?
Yes, it was amazing!
Did they have the same theme song?
Yeah, I love that!
I know.
I hope they get that out to the remixers again.
Yes, I love the Oakenfold mix.
That's my favorite too!
I love Depp.
He's amazing in "Pirates" again!
Not surprised.
They say it's the last movie in the series.
I don't believe it!
I hope it's not so.
I'd hate to lose the soundtrack too.
I know.
I'm sure Hans Zimmer will keep making music though.
Yeah, I wonder what other movie he's doing the music for.
I don't know. I'll look it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who Childish Gambino is?
No. Who is that?
Donald Glover? He is in Comuunity and Atlanta?
Maybe I would if I saw him. What about him?
Well, he is my favorite rapper. But his new album is awful
Really?
Yeah. It has a Mother's Finnest vibe to it.
And that's a problem?
Yeah. Don't get me wrong. I love the music genre. But Gamnimo is a rapper.
And you think he should stick to it.
Well, yeah. I mean, it's what he is good at.
What's your favorite song by him?
It's called Bonfire. I also like F it ALl
I will have to check it out.
Please do! He is really good.
Ever see him in concert?
No. I don't really like going to live events. But I would for him.
We should ccheck on out together.
For sure. He plays in Atlanta a lot.
We will go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm fine.
You don't sound fine. is something wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
Are you sure?
Well...
You can tell me.
I found some new music.
Some new music?
It's called Perturbator.
Perturbator? Is that some kind of disease?
It's a disease of the brain.
Why? What's wrong with?
It can't be talked to. It can't be reasoned with. It absolutely will not stop!
W-What!?
It's a lyric. From one of the songs.
Oh.
Also I listened to that song at full volume and now I have brain damage.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, not much. What are you up to?
Nothing much. I was thinking about maybe going out tonight.
Oh, really? Do you mean like a movie or something?
Yeah. I was thinking about going to a movie because everyone else went to that concert.
What were you thinking of seeing?
I don't know. I'm not really sure what's out.
Yeah, I haven't seen anything lately. I hear that Aliens movie is supposed to be good.
Oh, really? Which one is that?
That's that one that's based on an old movie with Sigourney Weaver.
I never heard of it.
Well, I'll avoid spoiling anything for you.
I appreciate it. You could tell me a little about the old one I guess.
Well, basically they're on a spaceship and they find out there's an alien on it.
That's it?
It's actually full of suspense, drama and action, though.
Do they just fight the alien the whole time or something?
It was more complex than that. Without giving too much away, there's a bit of mystery involved with finding out about the alien.
Oh, wait. Was that the one where an alien pops out of someone's stomach or something like that?
Exactly. It was really well done and really drew the viewer into the experience of being on the spaceship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I liked her in RED and RED 2.
I did too.
I think RED 2 was better.
So do I, but that's because of Anthony Hopkins.
Yes, I loved him as the bumbling professor.
I didn't see that twist coming.
Neither did I.
I also liked John Malkovich.
Ha, yeah. He was great in those movies.
Have you seen Being John Malkovich.
Yes. Talk about a weird movie.
Very much so. What else has he been in?
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Really, what was he in that?
He was the other person running for president.
The one who was the head of the weird sneeze religion?
Yes, exactly.
That was such as weird movie.
Yes, but it's also one of my very favorites.
So long and thanks for all the fish...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man have you seen the new Alien movie yet
You mean Alien Covenant?
Yeah!  That one!
No, I haven't had a chance to yet.  I take it you have?
Absolutely!  I went opening night.
How was it?
It was amazing.  Much better than the last.
Where do you put it in the ranking of all the films?
I would probably put it at about number 3.
So what are your top 2 in the franchise
Obviously the Original followed by the 1st sequel.
I always liked Aliens better than Alien
Oh really?  Why is that?
It just had more action and was all around a better movie.
I will agree it had more action.  But I don't know about a better movie.
Well to each his own.
Very true.  If you didn't like the original, you may not like Covenant.
Why is that?
It has the eerie similarity to the original.
Oh well. I will still go see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's it going?
Pretty good, how about yourself?
Good as well.  I'm actually in the process of watching all the James Bond movies.
That's always a fun way to pass time.
Time-consuming, but so much fun.
Who is your favorite Bond?
I think that while Sean Connery was the best, Daniel Craig is the face that I see when I think "James Bond."
Any particular reason?
I think it's just that he was the James Bond when I started watching.
That does seem to be how a lot of people pick their favorite Bond.
Who is your favorite?
I've always been a Roger Moore fan.  He had a campy sort of charm about him in his role.
Yea, he was another classic Bond.  I was very saddened to hear that he passed away.
The man was a legend.  He was great in 'The Spy Who Loved Me.'
I actually just saw that one.  What makes this one stand out to you?
This movie was the character Jaws' debut.  It was also outlandish fun.
I agree.  I think the director, Lewis Gilbert intended this, and made the film all the better for it.
Do you want any recommendations for which one to watch next?
Sure thing.
I would watch 'From Russia With Love' next!
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite movie?
Tough call!
What do you mean?
There's so many options! Throw me a more specific question.
Ok. Let me think of one!
Like if you were to ask me my favorite movie soudntrack, that'd be easier!
Ok then! What's your favorite movie soundtrack.
Definitely Crash.
It's been a while since I've seen that movie. What's the soundtrack like?
It's all this super ethereal instrumental music.
Sounds like sleepy music!
It is!
Why do you like it so much?
I actually like to fall asleep to music, it helps me relax.
Do you ever fall asleep to that soundtrack?
In fact I do! It's on my playlist of sleepytime music.
That's a good idea.
Do you have a hard time falling asleep?
Sometimes yeah.
Sometimes all it takes is a relaxing movie soundtrack!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up?
Not much, how are you?
Pretty good. See any good movies lately?
Yeah, actually. I've been trying to watch all the Oscar nominees.
Oh nice! Lots of good ones. What did you see?
Most recently I saw Passengers.
What did you think?
It was pretty good, I was surprised!
Yeah I liked it a lot too.
What about you? Have you seen any Oscar winners or nominees?
Yeah I've seen a bunch.
What's been your favorite?
Definitely Lion.
Oh, I really wanna see that! Any others?
I liked Passengers too.
Yeah I'm not a sci-fi fan, but really liked it.
Did you see Hidden Figures?
Not yet, but it's on my watch list.
That's definitely one I do want to see!
Let me know when you do- I'd love to talka bout it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how's it going? How was your weekend?
It was amazing I went and saw the new Alien movie.
I have been wanting to see Alien Covenant! How was it?!
The movie was absolutely great. I don't want to give anything away but Ridley Scott did not let us down with this movie.
I am totally going to go see it today after work then. I have to go see it in theaters to get the best effect.
That is a great idea. Did you know that James Franco is it?
What, no way. Does he have a good part.
Well actually, since it doesn't give anything important away, he dies in the first 5 minutes.
What!? No!
I know. But it is okay. He pops back up for a second and the movie is great with or without him.
Well do they answer all of the questions every Alien fan has had?
Yes! They finally answer everything but I will say, if you haven't seen Prometheus in a long time, you may want a refresher.
Well lucky for me I watched it last week because I was so excited about Covenant coming out.
Awesome well if you are really going to the movies tonight I'll go with you. I'd love to watch it again.
Sounds great! Looks like there is a show at seven thirty tonight at the iMax theather.
Great. Hope you are ready to watch some scary aliens trying to take over.
I have been waiting for a new Alien movie to come out for too long. I am ready. Plus I love Danny McBride.
Well you are in for a real treat because he did such a good job. I hope the cast him in more serious rolls.
Yes you are making me so much excited about this movie!
See you tonight at 7! Ill save us some good seats and get snacks. I am not getting up for anything. Don't want to miss out.
XXXXXXXXXXX

I´m OK
Have you been listening to the list of music I sent you?
Yes, I have

Just the melody

Same thing as Katy Perry

What do you mean?
What type of music do you preffer?
I prefer Rock Bands.

What are you up to this weekend.
Will probably take in a movie.
Are there any good movies coming up.
The Thor/Hulk movie must be coming sometime soon?
I was really disapointed in Logan.
I know. they made the Wolverine too dar.
I like backstory and Logan didn't have any.
Yep, they just dropped you into an apocalypse with no backstory.
My brother gave me two tickets to AMC, want to be my guest next week?
Cool, I'm always up for a movie. I'll buy the popcorn.
Okay, let's see what movie is playing next week.
Okay, maybe check Rotten Tomatoes.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Well I always try to listen to the good stuff.
Such as?
I listened to some of the highlights from Glee.
Glee? Ha ha!
No its true, they have some good recordings. Check it out.
Like who?
Matthew Morrison and Lea Michele.
Ok, I know they can sing.
Matthew Morrison does an awesome version of Dream On.
That has potential.
And Lea Michele does a wonderful version of Defying Gravity.
I like Wicked.
Yeah well they're the bomb.
If you say so.
I do say so.  You should check it out.
Any other Glee singers?
Chris Colfer.
Yeah he's won an award, right?
They go on tours and pack in the house. You should get your Gleek on some time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how's it going?
It's going well. How are you?
I'm fine, what have you been up to recently?
I went to a concert to see City and Colour. What about you?
Oh, Dallas Green, he's a very talented musician/songwriter! I went to see the movie Boss Baby.
Yes, he's is very talented! How was Boss Baby?
Boss Baby was funny. I saw it with a good friend.
Nice, I'll probably check it out with my kids.
That's cool, how was the concert by the way?
The concert was great, he's awesome to live. Do you have any other movie recommendations?
Finding Dory, and Pete's Dragon.
Oh yes, those sound good.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
I'm going to another concert, to see Kimbra.
Ah, I heard she's great live.
She is! This will be the second time I see her.
That's awesome! Have fun!
I will, thanks.
I'll probably just hangout with family.
Have fun with them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's up?
Not much, how are you?
Pretty good. Have any plans for this coming weekend?
Not yet, why?
Wanna get together and watch a movie or two?
Yeah, sounds fun!
What kind of movies do you like?
Pretty much anything, except Westerns!
Oh don't worry, that wasn't even an option to start with!
Were you thinking of going to see a movie in a theater?
Maybe, but I also have an extensive Netflix queue.
Any good dramas?
Yeah, of course! How about you joing me and you can pick the movie from my queue!?
Sounds good. I'll bring the popcorn.
It's a date then!
Sounds good. Anything else I should bring?

Hi, what is it your listening to on your ipod?
Oh, it's the new Jimmy Buffett album that just came out.
No kidding, what is it called?
Jimmy Buffett-Live at Wrigley Field.
Oh wow, he is great to see live!
Yeah so much fun!
It's more like a party than a concert.
Yeah it is, those Parrotheads know how to party!
Yeah they do, how is the album?
It's good, it has a lot of songs on it!
Thats a plus, is it old stuff or new stuff?
It is a little bit of both actually.
Oh thats pretty cool.
Yeah is has a lot of the classics like Volcano, and Margaritaville of course.
Oh yeah those are classics for sure.
There are also some new ones as well mixed in.
Nice, he always puts a lot of songs on his albums.
Yeah, can you believe he is 70 years old?
No way that is impressive!
Yeah, and still going strong!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow what a day. I need to take a break and listen to some music and unwind
What kind of music helps you unwind?
I like ambient music the best.
Like what or who?
Oh let's see... i like Nicholas Gunn. He is from England.
I haven't heard of him
He is very new age and also EDM, and plays flute.
What do you mean a flute? Like a metal flute or a Zamfir like thing?
He was trained in classical music from 7- 11 and then he moved with his family to California.
well that is a broad scope from EDm to New Age
yeah I guess he had to find his "voice".
What do you like of his that I should listen to?
Hi album Afternoon in Sedona Is what made me like his music.
Ok I will give it a try
If you don't listen to but one of his songs try Bamboo. It's a little less "sweet and syrupy" as some of the other ones. It's got a beat to it.
Not really something that i would normally go for but hey who knows..
That particular one is more like what I would call World Music.
Yeah I know what you mean by world music.
OOo that reminds me of that video that is on youtube with people from all over the world played parts of the song Stand by Me from the indigenous countries. So cool!
O good I need to look that one up too. Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any movies that are going to come out this summer?
Not really at the moment.
How about Baywatch?
I think that movie is going to bomb.
I dont know what the expectations are.
Well The Rock is in it.
So what does that mean?
He usually doesnt do dud movies
Well no one knows a bomb until the box office hits them
He knows how to read a script
Will any of the originals be in it?
I dont think they are.
Zac Efron is
He has become a meat piece for movies.
Like he cant act?
He can but its his body they want.
That sounds absurd.
Its like reverse sexism in LA.
Well he does have a great body.
But needs to improve his acting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, how have you been?
Great, thanks for asking!
Have you watch the last Jason Bourne movie?
I haven´t
You should watch it, it´s a good movie
I really don´t like Matt Damon performances
Why not?
I guess he is to stiff
Mmmhm I dosn´t seem like that to me.
You should wath Leo De Caprio movies, those are fantastic.
Yes, I know, Wich one is your favorite
Blood Diamonds
Wow, very interesting choice
How about you?
Mine is The Wolf of Wallstreet
I haven`t wathc that one yet
Are you serious? let´s watch it together
Sure.
Does Friday works for you?
Yes, Lets get toghetr at 5 PM in my place

yes i agree he played the part very well
they could not of gotten anyone better than him
i agree.
Did you like the part where his hand got really small?
yes that was so funny and random
i know i love that part of the movie.
i think its my favorite movie.

Haha, i agree with you on that. Well have a good day.
yes you too, dont get in any trouble
i wont!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you excited that it is finally the weekend?
Yes! This has felt like a really long week.
Do you have any exciting plans?
Not by normal standards, but I am excited about!
Okay, now you have me curious, what are you doing?
I am going to binge watch all four seasons of Orphan Black on Amazon Prime.
Why are you doing that?
Because the final season starts on June 10th.
What is the show about?
It is about a girl who find out she is a clone.
Oh, so like science-fiction?
Yeah - but there is so much more to it than that. Lots of rich characters, the actress is amazing.
Actress? So like one person does all the characters?
Well, all of the clones, yes.
How many clones are there?
Loads of them, but there are four main ones that are in almost all the episodes. A science geek, a soccer mom, and the main character who is just like a strong, ballsy woman.
That is only three. I thought you said four?
Well that one is hard to explain without giving mega spoilers. Season one she is attempting to kill all the clones because she has been brainwashed.
This show seems really complicated.
It really isn't once you start watching it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! What's up?
Nothing much how about you?
Nothing really. I did see a really neat movie though.
Which one?
It's called Moon.
When did that come out?
A while ago but I really liked it.
Was it well rated?
Oh heck yeah everyone really loved it.
I'mma need to check that out!
I can lend you a copy of it if you want.
I would really appreciate that.
Sure!
So what is it about?
It's about a guy who is stuck in a moon base taking care of things.
That sounds really neat.
I can't spoil it for you but I really think that you are ganna like it
How long is it?
It's only about a couple hours, nothing crazy.
I'll watch it this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how's it going?
Not bad, it's a lovely day today.
Yes it is, makes me want to sing.
Me too, reminds me of good times with good friends and great music.
I agree, I haven't seen a show in so long.
Me neither, when's the last time you went to a show?
I think it was 3 years ago to a Bob Dylan concert.
Whoa, he's still alive?
Yup, he looks old as dirt though.
How was the show?
Not bad, he still has a terrible voice but there's something to love about it.
Yes, he's a legend. I think he got famous because of his strange voice.
That or his genius writing skills.
True. Did you know he wrote a bunch of popular songs sung by other musicians?
No I didn't, which ones?
Well the most famous is "all along the watchtower."
Wow, I always just assumed Jimi Hendrix wrote it.
Nope, it was Bob.
Very cool, are there more?
Tons more, you should google it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how are you?
Good thanks, how about you?
Great! I finally just saw the movie La La Land.
That's the musical one right?
Yes! It was great. Like a throwback to the days where many movies were musicals.
I've heard it was really good. How was the music in it?
The music was great. City of Stars is a beautiful song and I really like We Can Start a Fire.
I think I've heard City of Stars. Isn't there a famous artist that sings too?
Yes, John Legend. He's the main voice on We Can Start a Fire.
Awesome. I wasn't so sure about it because of the lead actors.
You mean Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.
Yes. They aren't singers so I didn't know how that would be in the movie.
They actually aren't bad at all. They sign surprisingly well.
That's good to hear. Maybe I'll try to see it then.
I'd definitely recommend it. The music is very jazzy but I think even if you aren't a fan of jazz you can enjoy it.
I actually do like jazz so many it would suit me pretty well.
If you like jazz then you really need to see it. Ryan's character is a jazz musician and a lot of the movie centers around that.
Oh, I didn't know that. I guess I didn't really know what it was about.
It's both a love story, kind of, and the journey of the jazz musician finding his way back to performing.
Well I will see if I can get it on demand or rent it from Red Box. Sounds like I'd really like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you up to this weekend?
No plans, why?
I was thinking of catching a movie.
Which one?
I'm not sure yet. What do you know about any in theaters?
I haven't really caught many trailers except...
Except what?
The trailer for Rough Night...
You seemed hesistant to say you've see that!
Yeah, because it looks like a dumb movie, but also could be a guilty pleasure!
I just wanna see it- I don;t care how dumb it ends up being!
Do you wanna go this weekend then!?
Yeah, totally!
Sweet, I'll look up times for the theater near me.
Is that the one that serves beer?
Obviously!
Nice! Yeah I'm definitely down for a girl's night and crazy movie!
How's Saturday sound?
Sounds good!
Great, I'll look up the times and text you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any good rock songs lately?
No, not really. Music has really gone down hill since the late 90's.
You aren't kidding. I wish music today was like the music back then.
Yes. Everything is too commercialized today.
Even though early 90's music and rock was good, there were still some good bands in the early 2000's.
Yes, Godsmack, Disturbed, Three Days Grace.
Our Lady Peace, Slipknot.
Oh yeah. I forgot about those two bands.
How could you forget about Slipknot?
Maybe they blew out my eardrums and part of my brain.
Haha. Yes, they were loud and intense.
Have you ever been to one of their concerts?
Nope. I wish I had back in the day. I went to a Rob Zombie and Godsmack concert back in 2001.
Rob Zombie. He's awesome.
Yes. He was awesome. His newer stuff really mellowed out and became uninteresting.
I tend to agree with that.
His early stuff was headbanging, and then sometime around 2007, he really went down hill.
I think maybe because he was focusing more on making movies than making music.
That's a shame because he was a music genius when he put his full energy and time toward music.
Yes. For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like documentaries?
Yes but I am not always in the mood.
I know a great one you will like.
What is it called?
It is called Jiro dreams of sushi.
Oh that sounds interesting, I love sushi.
Yes it is about a guy who owns a sushi restaurant.
Where is the restaurant?
It is at the Tokyo Subway in Japan.
He only has one restaurant?
Yes, it is a small restaurant too.
Why is the documentary about one man?
Because there is a year round 3 month wait to dine there.
Oh wow I have never heard of such a thing.
That is how excellent the sushi is.
Wow it must be.
Yes the documentary movie discusses how he does it.
Wow that is interesting.
Yes we can learn from him.
Ok I plan to, thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how's it going?
Pretty well, you?
I'm doing solid. Listen to any good music lately?
Yeah yeah, I've been into Childish Gambino.
Childish Gambino? That's Donald Glover, right?
Yeah, he's good at pretty much everything.
He just put out a new album, right?
Yup, it's called Awaken, My Love.
You like it?
I do! It's real funky, kinda weird sometimes though.
What do you mean?
It just seems like there's too much going on in some tracks.
Oh, I got you. But there a chill songs too though, right?
Yeah yeah. I like Redbone and Me and Your Mama.
How does it compare to his earlier stuff?
I'm not an expert or anything, but this album feels like it's really trying to tell you something.
What does that even mean?
You'll just have to listen to it.
I guess so. I'll check it out.
Awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! How are you doing today?
Im doing well, how about yourself
Doing pretty good.
Nice! you do anything cool lately?
Yea, actually I got free tickets to a movie a couple days ago.
Oh cool, from where?
My favorite radio station was holding a contest, and I called in and won.
Oh sweet what station?
Z90.3 they play like top hits, pop, and a little bit of hip hop
Oh I love pop music, whose your favorite singer?
Hmm, Its probably a toss up between Katy Perry, and Taylor swift, how about yours?
Im more of an Ariana grande fan myself. So what movie did you see?
I saw Logan
Oh sweet, I wanted to see that how was it?
It was really amazing, it took a different twist on what normal marvel movies do, it was a little darker, and really told a story.
Wow thats awesome, wouldnt expect that out of marvel.
Yea, and Hugh Jackman acting was superb as always, he really added life to the movie.
Sweet, so you think its worth movie theater pricing then?
Yea for sure, you should go down and see it next chance you get.
Yea, I probably will, thanks.

Yes it has not been very pretty.
Do you know if it is supposed to rain later.
I hear that there was rain expected this afternoon.
Do you know around what time?
I heard about six pm.
I was supposed to go play pickup up basketball later.
What is the court outside?
Yeah, so if it rains we will not be able to play.
That is a real bummer.
Yeah I will have to find something else to do to exercise.
There is a swimming pool in the local gym.
That would be great, I have not swam in a while.
Yeah it is pretty cheap, only 5 dollars per session.
Well that is actually a decent price.
It is a fun pool, I have been there several times.
Okay Ill try it out.
Sounds like a good plan to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like music videos?

I've worked with so awesome bands.

The cure, Radiohead, the clouds
You know them?
Not really,I just worked with them a lot.
Who was the best band to work with?
Oasis.
Why?
Those guys knew how to party.
How did they.
There was so much drugs and alcohol.
You didn't stopt them?

I love her man, I feel like a woman song
That one is so much fun
It just makes you want to dance
Everytime I hear it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you every get to see the movie American Ganster?
The one with Denzel?
Yes thats the one.
No unfortunately I missed it.
Wow you must watch it tonight!
It was really that good?
Yes it is such a great story.
Wow please tell me more.
It has many different genres combined in the same movie.
That is nice.
Yes it is quite compelling.
Is it a family movie.
No this one is definitely rated R.
Ok I will put the kids to bed first.
Yes you will enjoy this one.
I am looking forward to it.
Pay attention to everything as there are a lot of subtleties.
Ok thank you for telling me.
Let me know what you thought of it.
Ok I will let you know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I'm really in to Migos just as you suggested.
They are great, right ?
I had a different perception for them. I was surprised by their new album Culture.
Which song did you liked the most ?
It's got to be T-Shirt. This song is everywhere now.
Did you know that it has more than 150 million views on youtube ?
That is amazing ! Which song did you like the most ?
Kelly Price with Travis Scott.
Oh yeah ? What is that about ?
Their usual, drug and women lifestyle. It is interesting, however, that it the song title is the name a famous RnB singer.
That is really cool.
And their continue to name drop through out the song.
Who is it produced by ?
I'm not sure, but surprisingly not by Travis.
Yeah, you would expect to produce that. He always does !
Yeah, but he just dropped 3 new song on WorldStart !
Oh, are they any good ?
One of them. Butterfly Effect has a sick beat. You should hear it.
Oh. I'll definitely will. Where can I find the song again ?
Just look it up on youtube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello, is this Bill Eversteen?
Yes, it is, how may I help you?
Well, I wanted to see if you had a moment to talk about Robocop.
It just so happens I do have a moment to talk about Robocop, but I'd like to talk a bout the sequel, too.
I'm sure that can be arranged.
Then I agree completely.
Great, lets begin.  Do you note a certain aspect of social satire that only Verhooven could interject into an action film?
I absolutely do. This is accurate
Do you think the sequel was able to capture it?
I actaully think they id an alright job of it.
But the human aspect of Robocop is what really grounds it. The question of his existance, his memories, whether Murphy is man or machine, correct?
Yes, Robocop is a much more nuanced film than one would think.
How well do you think the sequel did with the human aspect of the first.
Great question. A lot of people feel that the sequel didn't handle that as well.
Do you feel this sway?
No, I find it pretty obvious that since the first film dealt so heavly with this part, then they wanted to move on rather quickly. But they did address it early on, and in a couple more places throughout the film.
The stuff where Murphy keeps showing up at his wife's house.
after all this is a recurring character in comics with many stories to tell.Yeah they needed to move on
Last question, who wasthe better villan, Kurtwood Smith or Tom Noonan.
Eh, I liked the little kid from the second one. That was pretty cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, how are things?
I can't complain; how are you?
No complaints here either. I've been super busy recently, but mostly with cool stuff.
Yeah? Like what?
My brother and I went to see the band Mutoid Man play the other night; it was really good.
Mutoid Man? Never heard of them.
I think you'd dig them. Really heavy riff-based rock.
Kind of like Mastodon?
Eh, not really, maybe like a heavier Queens of the Stone Age.
Oh man, sounds right up my alley. So the show was good?
Yeah, it was super loud and my ears are still ringing. The show was two nights ago.
I remember when we saw Explosions in the Sky I swear my ears rang for a week.
Yeah man, those guys are super loud.
So good though. Did you know that they did the Friday Night Lights soundtrack?
No, I didn't. That's awesome.
Yeah, they've actually done a number of soundtracks besides that one.
Like what?
The Lone Survivor soundtrack.
Really? That was a pretty decent movie.
Yeah, I liked it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Wild?
Is that the one with the blonde actress, Kirstin Dunst?
Yes that is the one.
What is it about?
It is where she plays a hiker.
Oh that sounds interesting.
Yes it is actually really well done.
Why do you say that.
It gives a great character development story.
What do you mean exactly?
Her life background, outside of hiking, is thoroughly discussed.
Ok so it tells her motivations and rewards for hiking.
You understand this subject well.
Yes I like hiking.
Yes we humans are complex and derive interesting satisfaction from hiking.
I like hiking a lot.
Yes you need to watch this then.
Ok thanks for telling me.
Yes it is slow at times but super great in others, it is worth a watch.
Ok thanks for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any good movies playing this weekend?
hmm...doesn't look like it.. Oh wait, there's the new Terminator Genisys movie.
I heard it wasn't a bad movie, I'll go see it if you come with me.
Yeah, we can go right now if you want to.
Have you seen The Hateful Eight yet? It's so funny!
No, but I heard great things about it. I guess I have to see it now.
Yes, you have to! Let me know when you go to watch it. I wouldn't mind watching it again!
Probably tonight, if you're not busy.
Oh my gosh, The Hunger Games Mocking Jay is finally out!
No way! The first movie was so good. We HAVE to go see it right away!
Right? This one will probably be BETTER. Wanna go see it? Sometime tomorrow?
You don't have to ask me twice! Yes!
My dad wants to take me to the movies but we can't decide what to watch.
How about Tomorrowland? That's something I think your dad would like.
I don't know, that movie is a little boring. You sure he would like it?
Well, probably. Doesn't hurt to try.
Yeah, true. Okay, I guess I'll take him tomorrow.
Have you seen Trainwreck yet?
No, I haven't. Have you?
I thought we could go later to watch it together. That's why I asked if you saw it yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Excuse me sir?
Yes
Could you have your son not play his music so loud.
Sure, why?
I don't mind much, but he plays it too loud from his car as it's warming up.
I've told him
I was wondering
Yeah, he won't listen.he thinks he's a rock and roll star.
Yeah, but he had to realize that he's too loud.
Your should hear how loud his music is inside his car.
Can he still hear good?
I don't know, I'll ask.
Yeah, please have him keep it down.
What if I don't?
I'll go over and make him.
Do it and you'll see.
You'll see.just ask him to lower it.
I will.
Its ok if it's jazz.
I'll talk to him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did Mozart die of exactly?
No one really is sure about it.
But they have symptoms listed somewhere.
Yes. We know he suffered from fever, swelling, pain and vomiting before he was bed ridden
That sounds like a lot of bad stuff. i don't want to die like that
People have made 118 guesses so far.
As to what the illness was? That's ridiculous
yep. They have supportive arguments for their guesses, and they're pretty interesting.
Like what?
Well this one doctor said Mozart might have died from Acute Rheumatic Fever.
Who, and what's that?
It was published by the AAAS, which is the American association for the advancement of science.
So we should trust it? Just because AAAS said it?
Well it carries some weight if you ask me. Anyway, this was published by a panel of doctors.
So what's that fever?
It's called Rheumatic fever, caused by a streptococcal infection.
Sounds awful
yep. Its symptoms include painful joints, fever, rashes, vomiting, swelling, and irritation.
Did Mozart have all that?
Yep, he was so sick by the end of his life, he couldn't even sit up on his bed on his own. After a fit of delirium which can happen after heart starts to dysfunction which is also a symptom of Rheumatic fever, he fell into a coma and died. All in all, it just took 15 days for him to take ill and die. Acute rheumatic fever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey would you like to come and spend the night with me?
Sure, I have a lot of great movies that we could watch if you would like.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you have any funny ones?
I sure do, are you a fan of Chevy Chase?
My dad loves him! Which one of his do you have?
I have all of his in my collection. I thought about maybe bringing Nothing But Trouble.
I love that movie! I thought him and Demi Moore were awesome in that one.
They were, but did you know that Dan Aykroyd was also in the movie?
I do not remember him at all in that movie, are you sure?
Yes, he played the judge that was keeping them in the house.
I can not believe that I did not know that!
I am sure a lot of people did not know. John Candy was also in it.
I miss John Candy so much! His movies were a lot of fun.
I know, Only the Lonely is one of my favorite movies of all time.
That was a good one, have you ever seen Uncle Buck?
Only about 40 times!  That one was awesome,
I think John Candy and Chevy Chase are both legends.
I agree, they both have made a lot of great movies.
Comedy legends like those guys will never be forgotten.
I am just glad we can watch their films anytime we want!
XXXXXXXXXXX
what type of music do you like
I like mostly christian music
what bands do you prefer
I like Need to Breath, Casting Crowns and Jeremy Camp
Do you have a lot of cd's
no not really I listen to I heart radio
do you use the pay plan
no just the free streaming part
have you seen any of the christian concerts
no I just like to listen to the music
do you like christian based movies too
no not really so much
why not
the acting and story is just really too corny for my taste
i dont really like them either
do you listen to christian music
sometimes I prefer old 80's music
who do you listen to
UB40, Prince, Depech Mode, George Michael, quite a variety
oh I listened to all of that when I was a kid
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get a chance to see "Wonder Woman" yet?
Not yet.  Did you?
I saw an early screening last week.  I loved it.
Really?  Warner Brothers finally made a good DC Comics film?
I would say say they did an amazing job.
Interesting.  What did you like about it?
Can I say any spoilers?
No spoilers please.
Well, the movie's tone was much better than any of the other DC comics films.
Was it more light-hearted?
Yes it was.  It was light-hearted, but it was able to balance that with seriousness.
That sounds promising.
Gal Gadot did wonderful as Wonder Woman.
Was that a pun?
Sorry.  I had to say that.
How were the villains in the film?
The villains were just OK.  That was one of the weak points.
That's a shame.
Overall, it still didn't detract from the film.  I can't recommend it enough.
I may go see it tonight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's going on?
Not a whole lot. I'm looking forward to the weekend, though.
Do you have any big plans?
Yes. I'm going to Wrigley Field on Saturday.
Aren't the Cubs out of town?
Yes, but there's a big concert at Wrigley this weekend.
Oh nice! Who's playing?
Pearl Jam is headlining the Saturday night show.
Wow, Pearl Jam! I remeber when I got their first CD, Ten, at the record store at Harlem and Irving Plaza.
Oh right. I remember that record store.
It was called Rolling Stone, and they went out of business many years ago.
Oh that's too bad. I really loved taking the bus to Harlem and Irving and visiting that store.
Me too. We didn't have the internet back then and had to discover new music the hard way.
Haha yes! I remember "discovering" Nirvana before they got famous.
Those were the good old days.
Yes they were. I need to dig up my old Sony disc player and pop in an old CD.
Where did the time go? Pearl Jam is 25 years old already!
It seems like only yesterday that the grunge music movement took over.
Right. I bet everyone at the concert will be in their forty's.
No doubt! Well, I hope you have a great time at the concert!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you planning to go to any concerts this summer?
No, but Roger Waters is touring, I would love to see him. Tickets are really expensive though.
Oh man, that would be a sweet show. Is he doing more Pink Floyd or his own work?
I would think more Pink Floyd because that's what the fans want. I think his previous tour was The Wall, but this one is broader.
Yeah, that would be awesome to see in person. I've probably listened to Dark Side of the Moon like 1000 times.
Me too. It's crazy to think that it's been around for 40 years but still never gets old.
For sure, some of those classic rock albums hold up amazingly well. Just great music.
The Rolling Stones are still touring, I think. They're well into their 70s and still rock.
Haha, those tickets are even more expensive.
If you can afford it, I doubt you would regret paying for the tickets. It must be an unforgettable concert.
Yeah, I'll probably try to go to a few festivals.
Those are fun, depending on what bands are playing.
But the cool thing is there's usually something for everyone. You can go with a big group and split off to see different groups if people have different tastes.
Absolutely, the variety is what makes those so much fun.
The crowds can be a bit overwhelming though. I think I prefer assigned seats.
Yeah, you might end up with the girl on her boyfriend's shoulders right in front of you.
That would be super annoying. At least you could still hear the tunes.
True, and that's the most important part.
The music and the atmosphere. There's something about the live shows that makes it sound so much better.
I'm 100% with you on that one. The energy of the band and crowd are better than any home stereo ever could be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which album do you like better?
I liked the your lies album
Your lies is good.
Which do you like?
I liked the latest one.
Open season?
Yeah, that's a really good album.
I agree, that got the most radio play.
I think they had 5 songs in that album that played on the radio.
They did.
Do you know how many went to no.1.
No
4 of them Did.
Wow that's cool.
Yeah, you know they got paid.
I bet.
Did you buy it?
No,I just got the singles.
That's cool
I have the other albums
XXXXXXXXXXX
How have you been lately?
I've been sick. I'm starting to feel better, though.
Well, would you be up for hanging out?
Sure, as long as it's something low-key, like a movie.
I haven't been to the movies in a long time. Is there anything good out?
Well, all of the big summer movies are coming out now.
What are the big movies for the summer of 2017?
There's a bunch of them. There's superhero movies, action movies, animations and stuff like that.
I know about Wonder Woman. Is there another superhero movie this summer?
Yes. There's a Spiderman movie coming out in July.
Are there any others?
It depends what you consider to be a superhero movie, but there's Guardians of the Galaxy and The Mummy.
What animation movies are there this summer?
There's Cars 3 and Captain Underpants.
I've heard of Cars before, but what is Captain Underpants.
It's been a kids' book for quite a while. They've made it into an animated film.
It's hard to imagine it being very good. It sounds strange.
Well, apparently Dreamworks has worked on it.
Maybe it will be good. I guess we'll find out.
Yes. Dreamworks has done a lot of good movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how are you?
Im great, how are you?
I'm doing well thank you.
You're welcome
See anything good lately?
I just watched the xmen apocalypse
Was it good
I enjoyed it, have you not seen it?
No i havent
Y ou should check it out sometime
I think I will
Do you like xmen movies?
Yes I do, I think I've seen most of them
Which one do you like best?
Wolverine was pretty good
I liked that one
I enjoyed how they showed more of him
It was interesting
And he was with that girl that couldn't touch anything
I dont remember her name
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi. Haven't talked to you in a while.
Hello. Yes it's been a bit.
How have you been?
Great. I just saw the best movie.
What was it?
I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.
I heard that the music in that was wonderful.
It was. Like the first movie they used classic rock from the '70's and '80's.
What else can you tell me about it without giving away the plot?
Well, I wouldn't worry too much. The plot is the least impressive part.
You didn't like the plot?
It was just a little too simple. Everything was predictable.
What did you like about besides the music?
There is a lot to like. I especially like visual effects.
Did they bring back Michael Rooker's character from the first movie?
They did. His character's name is Yando and he had a large role.
He was my favorite from the first movie.
He great in the sequel. Michael Rooker is one of my favorite actors.
How was everything else?
On the whole the movie was great. Worth seeing in a theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of movies?
I'm not a movie person.
What! How can you not like movies!
I dont know, i just never got into them.
Thats bizzare. What do you do for fun?
Do you really want to know?
Yes, please.
I prune bonsai trees.
Trees. Really?
Really.
You can stare at a tree for hours but not a movie?
Movies are too loud these days.
You liked movies in the past?
As a kid, I liked cartoons.
Now we're getting somewhere! Any favorites?
I was a big fan of ferngully.
You would be. A movie about trees, of course.
Hey man, dont know it.
It is a pretty great film.
I think I have a problem.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, how are ya?
I'm doing pretty good.
What have you been up to today?
Not much, kind of lying around just watching Netflix, what about you?
Well I saw this new movie on Netflix.
Oh cool, what's it called?
The Keeper.
What's it about?
Well it's about these sexual molestations by priests and the murder of a nun.
Sounds dark, is this the stuff you usally watch?
No, I watch a variety of films. How about you?
I prefer comedies and fantasy movies.
Well what's the last movie you saw?
I actually saw Finding Dory recently, we rented it.
Did you enjoy the movie?
It really wasn't bad, however it was more of a kids movie.
Did it have adult jokes at least?
Yeah, Dory cracked a few funny jokes.
Well it was nice talking to you, have a good day.
Thanks man, you as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, haven't talked to you in awhile!
I know man, sorry I've been so busy with work.
Oh trust me I know that all too well.
How have you been?
I've been great! Had a few days off and was able to catch some movies with the wife.
See anything good?
Yes we watched Split last night.
Never heard of it!
Oh man, it's a crazy bizarre movie.
What's it about?
It's about a guy with tons of personalities who kidnaps some teenage girls.
Oh I think I saw something about that, like they have to figure out his personalities to escape.
Yes! It's really creepy and a little controversial.
In what ways?
There's some abuse and I guess mental illness stigmas.
I bet it is thought provoking though.
Oh for sure! It has some very taboo issues in it.
I like movies like that because as a culture it gets us talking.
Yes I think that was sort of the intent of the movie was to get us talking about issues we don't talk about enough.
Well I'm definitely going to have to put that movie on my watch list!
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you like the above the rib soundtrack ?
I loved that movie and the soundtrack both
Did you like tupac in the movie?
He did a good job in the acting
Do you like his acting or music better
In the movie he did well but the soundtrack is one of his best works
How about Juice ?
Excellent movie and Tupac should have got a award for his acting.
was the mosoundtrack good for juice ?
Yes but mot as good as Above the rim
What is another movie that was just as good as the soundtrack ?
I would say Dead Presidents
Why that one ?
They had lots of old school music like james brown. The music was better than the movie
Any more ?
Yes I think that Ju=esus Christ Superstar was another good one
How about Lady sings the blues ?
Also a good one.
Did you like the doord movie ?
I loved the movie and the music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Falco was weird. It was so 80s though. It's the quintessential Europop from the 80s
Not sure if I would call it that.
That was literally the first song in German I've ever heard.
i know that can't be right.
What? how do you know?
Because 99 Luftballons was back in 1983. Rock me Amadeus was in 85.
Oh.. Shoot. Right. I did hear that luftballons song before.
As a matter of fact, i would go so far as to say, it was Nena's popularity singing in German helped Falco to achieve his fame
Like, Americans have liked a German song before, so why not another German song...
Exactly.
But anyway, the way Mozart was portrayed was kinda weird. He was portrayed so odd, childish, and immature. And what's with the laughter?
Eccentric. i think the movie makers wanted to portray his eccentricity.
Yes! Eccentric.
Well. Mozart in his time was an incredibly odd fella. And to go against the grain to write an Opera in German, at the time, was unheard of.
Movie makes an error. Mozart was not buried at a pauper's mass grave.
It is known that he was interred in a common grave.
Yes. Not sure why the movie maker made that error or did it intentionally.
Probably did it intentionally to elicit more emotions from the audience.
But that's a fake emotion off a false idea. That's... violative.
That's a big word for you. Yeah, it's somewhat misleading. But it makes you really hate Salieri.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How have you been doing lately?
I have been good, just catching up on a lot of movies here lately.
Yea that is what I love to do sometimes; just set around and watch movies.
Have you saw any good ones lately?
Yea I just recently watched Fist Fight.
I have been wanting to see that one, how was it?
I loved it; it was very funny and entertaining.
I might go buy that one tomorrow and have a movie night.
You will not regret it, I think you will enjoy it.
Lately I have been watching a lot of eighties movies.
That was a great decade for movies, which ones have you watched?
I just finished License To Drive. Have you ever seen it?
I watched that one many years ago, but I remember liking it.
Yea me and my wife like watching old ones like that every now and then.
Yea sometimes those old ones can bring back a lot of memories.
Do you have any favorites that are from that decade?
I have always been a fan of the Back to the Future movies with Micheal J Fox.
I have probably seen every one of them like ten times.
They are movies that you really can watch over and over without getting bored.
Micheal J Fox is a great actor that will always be a favorite of mine!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, guy.
Hi, What's up?
I wondered if you've ever heard of Deanna Durbin?
No, who's that?
She was this amazingly popular singer and actress from the forties that nobody has ever heard of today.
Huh! What was she in?
There was a really funny one called "It Started With Eve". She pretends to be Bob Cummings's fiancee because his dad is dying. But then the dad gets well, oops.
I know Bob Cummings. He can be funny.
Yeah, he's really caught in the middle here. He set up the impersonation to give his dad a happy last moment, but then what does he do?
Anyway, so what about this Durbin woman?
Well, she wants to get out of the situation, but comes to like the father and doesn't want to disillusion him.
That sounds pretty trite.
You'd think so, but the thing about Deanna Durbin is that she makes it all seem really fresh.
You seem to have really developed a crush on her!
Yeah, well, maybe. It's just so odd to me that she could have been such a big name and be almost unremembered now.
I guess. Under the old studio system, the actors were a lot more like commodities. Even big stars sometimes had to do two or three movies in a year.
It's true, I guess there were probably a lot of actors that everybody recognized then but we don't know now.
I read somewhere that they almost cast Ronald Reagan as Rick in "Casablanca."
Naw, that's a myth. They were considering George Raft, though.
Wow, that would have been strange.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the the movie industry will evolve?
As far as making them?
Delivering them.
I think eventually they will all go direct to video.
I am almost on the same page as you.
Like physical DVDs?
DVDs are even obsolete now.
So directly to Blu Ray?
Not even a physical copy.
So Netflix?
Basically I can see it doing that.
Dont you think the subscription fees for that movie service is too low?
Yeah but their pricing model will change.
So how will they measure a movie's success?
I believe you can pay to see the movie.
OK wont that cripple the movie theater industry?
Absolutely but they need to come up with creative ways.
Like putting a bar in the theater?
No people dont go to drink at a theater
Wow these are so monstrous changes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, how was your weekend?
Hi, it was great! I went to see a movie.
What movie is it?
The new Pirates of the Caribbean.
Is it a good movie? Do you like it?
Well, I feel the storyline is somehow boring, but I like the music in the movie.
Yeah, I watched the previous movies in the same franchise. I am really impressed by the music.
Ah, are you also a fan of this movie franchise?
Not really though. I used to like the actor Johnny Depp very much. However, since his divorce, I do not like him very much.
I see. Well, I cannot comment on Johnny Depp's personal traits, but his performance in the movie franchise is absolutely fantastic.
I agree. I like the actors' performance and the music in the Pirates of Caribbean series.
Have you heard about Hans Zimmer?
Is he the music and sound composer of Pirates of the Caribbean?
Yeah, he has many famous works but Pirates of the Caribbean is one of those fantastic ones.
What other movies has he involved in?
There are a lot, such as The Lion King and The Dark Knight.
The Dark Knight? That is one of my favorite movies ever!
Interesting to know that. I also like the new Batman's movie a lot. The director is Christopher Nolan.
I know him. I am a big fan.
Great. He is directing a new movie Dunkirk. Let's go and watch it together in this summer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite band?
Do you mean current band or a band that is no longer together?
It doesn't matter. What is it?
I'd have to say the Monkees!
The Monkees? I love them!
They're amazing and their music is so catchy.
Didn't other people write their songs?
I believe so. I think Carole King & Neil Diamond wrote a few.
What was their big hit?
You're thinking of the song "I'm A Believer"
I love that track!
Yes, me too. I loved the remake they did for Shrek.
I prefer the original.
I do too. But I was happy they brought the song back to life.
Do they have any other hits?
Yes, I think "Last Train to Clarksville" was a hit
What is that song about?
I assumed it was about a train. But many artists love to use metaphors.
Maybe it is about life and death and the passing of time.
That is possible. But it also might just be simple and about a train.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think music is heading in the right direction
What measurement are you using?
The way people get content.
What streaming service do you use?
I think Spotify is the best
Better than Pandora?
Yeah I think its a sleeker design and what you pay for is the best.
I think its cheap.
Plus you can get it for a discount if you try hard enough.
How about YouTube?
No there are too many ads in the app.
You can pay to eliminate those.
Yeah but its not enough for what i Use it for.
Plus the data streaming is alot more.
And it kills the battery on the phone.
What about Apple Music?
I think its too pricey.
Some people love to use Apple products.
YEah I am not one of them
Its important to be financially sound when making that decision as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so who is your favorite rock band?
It is linkin park without any doubt.
I used to be fan of them, But not anymore.
Oh, why is that so?
I think LP has changed is genre from rock to more of a techno.
Yes, their last album of mix of techno and rock.
Yes, Exactly, Their first two albums were pure rock.
But what's wrong with techno rock? I find it to be better than rock music.
I guess that is individual preference.
Yes, that is just what I feel.
Though, I did like thousand suns album, even though it was not pure rock.
Well, I am glad to hear that, tell me more about it.
I especially loved the catalyst song.
Wow what a co incidence. that is my favorite song as well!
I even loved the music video of catalyst.
Yes, the music video was very thoughtful.
I feel whoever edited that music video was really professional.
Yes, the editor seems to be expert.
Okay, so do you want to hear catalyst right now?
Sure, I would love to hear it right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there!
Hi, how are you today?
Doin' just fine, super ready for the weekend.
Oh yeah? You doing anything special?
Hoping to go to the theater with my BF, haven't decided what I'm going to go see though.
I love movies, maybe I can help!
Sure, that'd be great!
What kind of films do you guys like?
Well, we're always up for fantasy and such.
What about the newest Pirates film? That one came out just last week so she probably hasn't seen it yet.
Ew, no. I'm so bored with those films, they should have stopped after the first.
Hm, okay. What about Wonder Woman?
Isn't that DC? Their last movies weren't that great.
It is, but all the reviews have been really positive about this one.
Oh, I didn't know that!
Yeah, and honestly judging by the trailer alone it looks really good.
Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman in this one, right?
Mmhm, she's an Israeli actress and she's quite talented.
Cool, I'll check it out--it is out now, right?
It premieres in theaters this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bought any good albums lately?
A Prince album.  I got really nostalgic after he died.
Which album?
Purple Rain.
Yeah nice.
I like the song Purple Rain especially.
I know what you mean.  That was a different time.
Also I like the movie Purple Rain. Ever saw that?
I remember when it came out.  Didn't see it though.
It was a rock drama. Prince starred in it.
Missed it.
Prince got a couple Grammys for the music album.
Good guy.
The movie came out when they were still using VHS!
Now we've got dvds and Blu-Ray.
When I hear VHS I get nostalgic.
Ha ha ha.
Now vinyl is back in style! Maybe VHS will return.
What goes around, comes around.
That's the truth.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey, what's going on man?
Not much. I was thinking of watching a movie tonight.
Oh, which one?
No Country for Old Men
Oh, I saw that one a few years back
What did you think?
I liked it, but some people that were watching it with me didn't like it
Why not?
They didn't like the ending and some of the abruptness of it
Have you read the book as well?
Yeah, it's very true to the book
Okay, I read the book to and I was curious what the movie adaptation is like
Yeah, it's really good. Cohen brothers production
Oh yeah, I like their work.
Yeah and Javier Bardem is really good in it as Antoine Chugar
Oh yeah, the big bad assassin dude, right?
That's him.
Okay let's watch it later tonight
Sounds good. later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the film called Get Out?
Is that the one with near perfect ratings?
Yes it has some of the best ratings I have ever seen for a movie.
Wow that means many people all agreed on it being excellent.
Yes that is it precisely.
That means people who like different things managed to find things to really like about it?
Yes that is exactly it.
What was so great about it?
It was funny yet satirical, dramatic yet historical.
Wow that sounds smart.
Yes the writer is Jordan Peele.
Is that the comedian?
Yes he was on Saturday Night Live.
Wow he was really funny.
Yes this movie is much more than a comedy too.
Ok that sounds intriguing.
Yes it was really well done.
What genre is it?
Its hard to say but it even has some horror in it.
Ok thanks for the great recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
you a fan of guy ritchie movies?
no, what are those?
hes a director. british crime dramas.
not a fan of foreign films.
hes different, trust me. they are hilarious.
funny drama?
yeah, he uses quick cuts and witty dialogue. its great.
im intrigued. why did you ask?
he has a new movie coming out.
Whats it about?
Its the story of king arthur!
Get out.
Serious. I personally cant wait to see his take on it.
Crime drama king arthur? I cant fathom it.
The trailer looks great.
Oh yeah?
Definitely, we should go see it!
Maybe I should start with some of his other movies.
I have some recommendations for sure!
Ok, lets get to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about soundtracks in movies?
I think they can add a nice touch.
I dont think they do anything for me
They used to be bigger than they were
I always see at the Emmys people getting nominated for Scores.
It used to be a big deal
I hate when actors are featured on it as well.
Like who?
Well Justin Timberlake for example.
He can do both.
Right but choose your lane.
Why not do both if you can?
SO then you are making a Disney movie.
Essentialy yes but whats wrong with that.
I just dont see the direction its going is really that important
Well its a big deal for kids.
I dont think mass appeal is important
Sure it is
Not really, Hamilton did well
Yes, for a specific audience
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everything going good for you?
Just keeping busy.
Me too. Had any down time?
I have a little. Been trying to fill it.
My down time I watched some movies.
Oh yeah, like what?
I just saw some old movie about a Princess, Princess Bride.
The best movie ever. What you think of it?
It was not what I thought it would be.
So, you liked it
It was an amazing film. I liked the score.
The music is really perfect in that movie.
Made me feel like I was part of the fairy tale.
It is one of the best sort of funny but touching movies I have ever seen.
I liked the way the music was serious.
The full orchestra and so on?
Yes! The classical scoring, so fitting.
The show I think reflected that. The serious and the silly all in one.
I love movies that take me on an adventure like that.
I like when that adventure has good music too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Been up to anything lately?
I've been watching Lord of the Rings.
Which one?
What do you mean which one?
I mean. the Peter Jackson ones or the animated ones?
There were animated ones?
Yeah, back in the seventies or osmething like that,
Well obviously I'm not watching those since I don't know they existed.
Well, that makes sense. So the Peter Jackson ones then?
Which ones are those?
The ones that were made by... Peter Jackson?
... They have a lot of CGI.
Okay yeah, so it's the Peter Jackson ones.
Oh yeah! Those ones! I've been watching those ones.
So have you been enjoying them?
No, they're terrible!
Why do you think they're terrible?
Because they keep killing the Orcs! It's disgraceful! The Orcs are just peaceful immigrants, fleeing from a wartorn homeland!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good movies lately?
Just whatever the kids are watching!
Tell me about it.
Some of the new kids movies are actually pretty cute though.
Yeah, until you've seen them 500 times!
Agreed. My daughter won't stop watching Moana, so I can't say that's one I enjoy.
That's how my daughter was with Frozen, until Moana came out!
I still think Frozen is a cute movie.
Yeah, I do too.
It's good to have a Disney movie without a prince charming kind of person.
I'm all about teaching my daughter girl power!
Are your kids watching Over the Hedge?
Yes! That's my favorite. It's so cute.
Totally. The animal movies totally get me.
Me too. I loved Ice Age when it came out ages ago!
Yeah, animated movies were different before we had kids!
Agreed! Happy Feet was another one I loved.
Me too. But now my world is Moana.
Oh, I can recite all the lines from that movie!
Wanna get our daughters together for a playdate?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Death Cab for Cutie?
Yeah, from what I've heard.  They don't get much airplay.
Did you think that that last Star Wars movie was as good as the others?
Definitely.  It was better that some of the others like Phantom Menace.
I remember watching the Talking Heads on Saturday Night Live.  Do you see that?
Are you sure they played on SNL?  I don't remember anything about that.
People were saying Hacksaw Ridge was a good as Saving Private Ryan.  I don't know.
Well, Hacksaw Ridge is a true story so that makes it better.
I really like the lead guitar that Pearl Jam had, what ever happened to him?
Pearl Jam is still around, I imagine he's still kicking.
I want to see a good movie.  Have you seen any lately?
I would recommend Alien Covenant if you're into sci-fi and aliens.
I really want to see Dunkirk.  Have you heard anything about it.
Not anyone that's seen it.  It doesn't come out until July.  Looks like it may be good.
Do you think the Rolling Stones will ever do another tour?
I bet the will until most of them are dead.  Keith Richards will never die.
I really want to see the Pixies, I wonder if they will ever play again.
I don't know.  If they get within 300 miles, I'm there.
Not another Transformer movie!  How many does that make?  Based on toys...
I'm not sure but a few.  They really aren't that bad but I'm not sure I want to pay $12 a ticket.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's up?
Hey buddy!  How have you been?
Pretty good.  I just got out of work.
Same.  It's been a long week.
Tell me about it.  Have any plans?
Not really.  I was going to wind down with a movie and a few beers.
I was going to do the same.
You should swing by.
Any movie suggestions?
I was thinking of rewatching the 'Lord of the Rings' movies.
That sounds great.  It's one of my favorite movie trilogies.
It was so far ahead of its time.  What was your favorite?
I loved the first one since it introduced us to the world of Middle-Earth.  It also had the best balance of all the elements; adventure, action, drama.
I really liked the first one; especially the Cave troll scene.  That said, I am a big fan of the action of 'Two Towers.'
Helm's Deep was such a great scene.  Theoden's speech was an instant classic.
It gives me chills every time.  'Lord of the Rings' is also one of the few movie franchises that stay true to the original source material.
Yea, they did justice to Tolkien's works.
True masterpieces.
Well, we should start soon if we want to get all the way through to 'Return of the King.'  Especially considering how long the last one is.
Sounds good.  See you soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man!
Sup buddy?
Not much.
Like this weather?
Oh, yeah!
Summer is coming on!
What you up to?
Was thinking about going to the concert tonight.
Yeah?
Who's playing.
The Dirty Heads.
Never heard of them.
They're kind of a ska band.
Ska?
It's like reggae?
Oh....
Kind of like Sublime.
I love that band!
You should come along.
Sounds fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I lived in Detroit I used to be able to see a band any night of the week. I miss it.
Did you see anybody good?
Oh yeah. I saw a lot of great bands. Not all of them famous or anything. Just good, local music. There was a really thriving music scene during the time I lived there. There is still is, I would imagine.
Did anybody get famous?
Well, the White Stripes certainly became very well-known.
Did you see them?
Many times, yes. They used to play music on my street.
Oh really?
Yeah. We would have a block party. We would build a stage and have music, beer and dancing all day. White Stripes played. Also other Jack White side projects, also.
Did you like their music?
Oh forsure. Many people did. Although, when they became famous many people became bitter.
How so?
Well, people who had helped Jack felt that they owned a piece of his success. They felt they were owed something.
What did they feel they were owed?
I don't know. Many of these guys were musicians who had helped produce or record his first album. They wanted more recognition, fame, and money.
Do you think they were jealous?
Somewhat. Many of these guys were in absolutely fantastic bands that never received the kind of attention the White Stripes did. Maybe they felt they deserved it more. It was a strange time.
Is Jack White a nice guy?
He was always nice to me. Kind of quiet, but sweet. He is really talented guy.
I wish I could have seen them play back then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long has it been?
I don't know,a few years?
That's seems about right.
So how long have you been in line?
3hrs.
When did you hear that concert tickets were going on sale?
Yesterday on the radio.
Me too.
Did you enjoy the new song?
Not really.
Why?
It was too much of a slow song.
I could see that.
I'm sure the other songs will be faster.
So how many tickets are going on sale?
Under 1000
Wow, that's a little
I know, how many are you buying?
4 and you
I'm buying 2
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess who's 50 today?
Your mom?
No, guess again.
Mr.Thomson?
No
I give up.
Is the Beatles sgt.peppers album.
50 years? Really?
Yes
Do you think it sounds dated?
No
I don't think so either.
Do you have it?
Yup, in vinyl
Lucky, come over
Are you sure?
Yes, just come.
Ok I'm on my way
Don't forget the record.
I won't
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess the song.
Go on.
"Staking in a park"
I need more.
How about the year?
That may help.
1987
Hummm. Is it by Duran Duran
Yes, if I give you more clues, you'll guess.
Is it "food on me"?
Yes
That's a good jam
I love to dance to that.
I never have, but I guess so.
There was a lot of dance music then.
Yup, the 80's
Do you like music videos?
Not really? How about you?
Yes,I dig them
I guess they are ok.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's up?
Not much, how's it going with you?
Pretty much same thing, different day, working to make ends meet. I'm also trying to put up enough money to go to California this summer.
Awesome! What's in California?
Well, besides the obvious, the Moody Blues are touring out there this summer.
The Moody Blues? I haven't listened to their music in a while.
Yep, they're still going strong. In fact, the lead singer, Justin Hayward, and the bass player, John Lodge, each did solo shows earlier this year and I got to see them both!
Wow, that's great! How were the shows?
Well Justin's was acoustic and pretty laid back, but it was good. John's was more electric and energetic. I loved both shows, but my husband enjoyed John's the best.
And now the Moody Blues will be touring this summer?
Yes, mostly the West Coast. It's the 50th anniversary of their first album, Days of Future Passed. They'll be performing every track from that album, and even playing with a symphony orchestra in some cities.
Wow, that sounds amazing.
I'm sure it will be. I've talked to my husband about trying to get out to see them in California or maybe Nevada, but he's saying we can't afford it.
That's too bad. How much are tickets?
They're not cheap, I think they start at around a hundred dollars. And that's just a part of it. We'd probably want to fly, so there's the air fare, and then of course a hotel room for a couple of days, and meals.
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. Do you think you can come up with the money somehow?
I'm wishful thinking. But realistically I don't see how we can pull this off, even if went alone.
Why would you want to go alone?
Well, my husband isn't as into the Moody Blues as I am, so he wouldn't really care if he didn't go. And I know other fans on the West Coast that I would be able to hang out, so I wouldn't really be by myself.
Gee, I hope you can figure out a way to get there! Hey, I need to run, but let's hang out soon, okay! Call me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what time is it?
It is 10minutes to noon
Did you watch that movie Alien covanant?
No i did'nt my friend told me that movie was horrible.
Do you like to eat Meat?
No i am a pure vegetarian i have never tried meat before.
I am feeling a little gassy you think it is because of the food we had?
Its is possible that Burrito had a lot of beans in it.
Do you know where i can get my car brakes fixed for a reasonable price?
Yes there is a shop on 12 and walnut by the shoprite. Go ask for Mike and he can help you with it. He is usually good on the labor charges but i am not too sure how much he will charge for the parts
Do you like vannila icecream?
No thats the only flavor of Icecream i can not stand. I feel like there is no point in having Vannila icecream the flavor is so plain.
Did you play the new Mortal Kombat X ps4 game?
Yes i did, i really love Kenshi he has the best telepathic moves in the game.
Did you know that my Nissan Altima brakes are completely worn out?
No i didnt but heard that you had to park your car in the mall but didnt know why.
Did you read the news today?
Yes i did, i didnt like the fact Akari Theraputics Ceo just resigned. I hae 10000 shares sitting in that stock.
Did you see that stop sign because this is the 3rd stop sign you didnt stop for!
Yes i saw all the stop signs but look the roads are clear and there are no cops so there is nothing to worry about. Just relax and let me do the driving.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's up?
Nothing much. How have you been?
I've been doing pretty well. You?
I'm doing really great right now. I just saw the greatest superhero movie ever.
Oh yeah? It was better than Man of Steel?
Yeah it actually was.
Stop holding me in suspense. What's the movie?
Logan.
From the X-Men series?
Yep. It's set in the future and he's old.
Wow.  What made it so good?
He has a kid and it's bloody.
Sounds like my kind of movie.  Did it just come out?
Yeah, a few weeks ago. It's actually kind of sad.
Well, I'll see for myself. Don't spoil the movie for me.
I won't tell you anymore.
Good.  Do you mind seeing the movie twice?
No. I would definitely watch that movie again.
Great. Let's go this weekend.
It's a date.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what movie I saw yesterday?
Logan.
That's right. How did you know?
You've only been talking about it for the last month.
It was fantastic!  There was this great scene....
Save it. I'm not interested.
What!? Why not?
I don't like superhero movies.
Logan isn't a superhero. Well, not exactly. He's....
I don't care. I don't like those type of movies.
Well, ok.  What do you like?
I like movies about situations I can relate to, with regular people who aren't waving guns around and bulging with muscles but yet they never eat or if they do they only eat salads.
You mean like regular dumb farts who eat Pop-Tarts for breakfast?
Exactly.
So you must have liked Ordinary People?
Oh, that was superb. Especially the part where Mary Tyler Moore got naked.
Wait, what!?  I don't remember that.
Oh, you missed an eyeful buddy. She was a knockout.
I gotta check Netflix. I mean, right now.
Relax--it's in my list.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, the kids are bugging me to take them to the movies for their birthdays.
Yeah? Take them then, they will have a good time.
But I don't know any good kids movies.
Take them to see the Minions movies. The little yellow things from the Despicable Me movies? They will love it.
Oh yeah! I totally forgot about that. Sure, that sounds good.
Hey, wanna go to the movies with me? I'm bored right now.
Sure, what are you wanting to see?
The new Mission Impossible movie. Rogue Nation.
That's a good choice. I would love to go with you.
I was about to go to sleep until this movie came on. I ended up staying up late watching the whole movie.
Yeah? What movie?
Spy! With Melissa McCarthy. It was so good, I might watch it again tonight.
Ha ha, okay let me know. I will watch it with you.
Yeah, sure!
My friend wants to go with me to the movies, but I have no idea what he wants to see.
Take him to the new Star Wars movie. The Force Awakens. All men like Star Wars, haha.
Okay, that's true. Well, good idea then. Thanks.
Do you wanna go see Straight Outta Compton with me?
Sure okay, what time?
In about 5 hours, I have to go to the store first!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into music at all?
Of course! Who isn't?
Yeah, good point!
Why do you ask?
Just wondering if you watched the Voice at all this past season.
I caught most of it.
Who was your favorite singer?
From the finale or altogether?
Any singer!
Tsoul was definitely my fave. I was so sad when he didn't make the finale.
Oh my god, me too!
He has such natural talent.
Definitely. And there isn't enough soul music out there these days anyway.
Yeah, you're right.
Do you think that's why he didn't make the cut?
I've never thought about it, but it makes sense.
I think that's what happened. But we need a soul music revival these days!
I totally agree. We need music with passion
Let;s check out his website- maybe he's touring!
Good idea!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man
Hey, what's up?
Not much. Want to catch a movie?
Sure, which one do you want to see?
Beauty and the Beast
What?! The Disney one?!
Yeah that's right
Umm, I'm not a girl dude
So what. It's suppose to be really good.
Dude, I think it was made for younger girls and their moms
No, I heard this one is really good.
How do you know?
I read some great reviews online and in the paper
Man, I don't know if I'd enjoy seeing it
Didn't you see the new live action version of Cinderella?
No
Okay, well that one was really good. Really good costume design and acting.
You know what, I think I'll pass.
Okay, you're loss man
Whatever dude
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up?
Nothing much. You?
Same. Hey, you went to the movies this weekend right?
Yeah, with the family.
What'd you guys watch?
The new Pirates of the Caribbean movie.
Ohhh interesting. How was it?
Honestly, not that good.
No? Why?
It was just wayyyy too long.
I hate movies that are like that. Anything else?
Yeah, I felt like they really wasted Jack Sparrow in this one.
What do you mean?
He wasn't the main guy! He was essentially the drunken sidekick the whole time.
Was he at least funny though?
Yeah, in his usual way, but it just felt kind of cheap.
Huh. Does Orlando Bloom come back?
He actually does. The story revolves around his son though.
I guess that could be fun. Should I watch it?
Probably not in the theater. Save yourself some money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So when did you stay playing the bass?
3 years ago.
Really?
Yeah
Side, you are really good.
Thanks
Do musicians run in you're family?
No, I'm the first.
What made you want to play.
I just saw the bass on sale and thought it looked cool.
It does.
Thanks
Do you think you could show me how to play?
Sure
When are you free.
How much money do you have?
Your going to charge me?
In some way or form
Oh,I get it.
Let's do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi there.
What have you been doing lately?
Nothing much. Just been watching movies.
What movies?
Last one I watched was Dredd.
Good choice. I love that movie.
So do I. It's criminal that they're not making a sequel.
Blame the advertising department.
Yeah, I heard it didn't do well in theatres.
They totally failed to market the movie correctly.
It did really well in DVD sales, though.
I heard that too, but I guess it still wasn't enough.
Nope. Execs don't know what's good for them.
At least it's getting a TV show.
Wait, really?
What's what I heard.
Well at leats something is happening!
I'd still prefer a new movie though.
Yeah, me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hows it going?
Pretty well. Busy day over here. How are you?
Good! Just listening to some music.
Cool, what band?
The Flaming Lips
I've heard of them, they're great.
Yes, I'm a big fan. Do you have a favorite song.
I don't know enough of their music. What is your favorite?
I like "Do You Realize"
I don't think I have heard of that one before. Is it new?
No, it has been released for a few years.
I will have to check it out.
Do you have a favorite band?
I really like Imagine Dragons.
They're huge, one of the biggest rock bands in the world.
Yes, and they've only been around for a few years
How did they get so big?
They had lots of radio play and also several big placements in TV and movies,
I will have to listen to their most recent album.
You should! They have a song called "Warriors" that came out fairly recently and is catchy
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally saw the movie La La Land.
About time. What did you think?
Do you mean what did I think of the plot, the music or the whole thing?
Well tell me what you liked or didn't like about the movie.
It wasn't what I expected after all the hype
Like how?
I thought it was going to be like a modern take on an old fashioned movie musical.
There was a lot of music. I liked a couple of the songs a lot.
I didn't HATE La La Land. It's fun. It's cute but I don't think it compares to a good movie musical.
Why not?
In a good movie musical, you can take away all the songs and dances and it will still be a great story with great dialogue and performances.
I see what your saying. Like Grease, Chicago, West Side Story-the classics.
Exactly, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were very good, but I wanted more.
More what?
More development in the characters, better dancing....I kept waiting for the next dance scene, more connection between the main characters.
Well, did you like the music?
I did actually, especially the song Audition and City of Stars
What did you think of the La La Land theme music. I thought that was cool.
Oh, I do like that too and I really liked how it looked-the cinematography? Gorgeous.
I know what you mean-  it was dream like sort of like dreamy vintage postcards of LA
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's going on with you?
Nothing much. Just bored out of my mind.
I don't see how you can be bored, especially with the invention of music.
Ha, ha. Lately, all these music artists sound the same.
How could you say such a thing? (feigns shock)
It's true. Who can you say is different from the rest?
Beyonce.
Ok, you have a point. I don't really listen to her though.
Hence the fact of your boredom.
Is she that great? You're driving a hard promotion here.
Are you kidding me? Beyonce has changed my life for the better.
How can a celebrity affect you in such a great way?
All of her albums speak life into me, especially Lemonade.
Isn't that the one about a tumultuous relationship and how she overcame it?
Yes, exactly! What gal can't relate?
You have a point there too. (smiles)
See there, Beyonce has already made you smile and you have yet to press play.
Thanks for the info. I'll check her music out.
Thank me in concert tickets to see her one day.
We'll see... (Winks)
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoy Bruce Willis movies, what about you?
Yes me to. I think he is one of the best.
I could watch the Die Hard movies over and over again. They never get old!
I really enjoyed part two. I think it was my favorite out of the whole series.
That one was really good, but I would go with Live Free or Die Hard.
Speaking of the Die Hard movies, they may be the best action franchise of all time.
I don't know, the Lethal Weapon series is up there for me.
Yeah, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were a great combination in my opinion.
Comparing Lethal Weapon and Die Hard is very difficult but I would give Lethal Weapon a slight edge.
I think I would go with the Die Hard series just because Bruce Willis is one of my favorite actors.
I can understand that, either way they are both great franchises.
Are there any more action movies that can compete with either of those?
I don't think so, although Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger may have something to say about that.
That is true. The both of them have put out some legendary action films.
In terms of Arnold, the Terminator films were fantastic.
I agree, but I think Kindergarten Cop is one of my all time favorite films.
Have you seen the sequel with Dolph Lundgren?
Yes but it was not the same at all!
I know, I wish Arnold would have came back and renewed his role as John Kimble.
Yes, that would have been awesome. It would have made a lot more money at the box office if he had of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how's everything going?
Pretty good, what's up with you?
Oh nothing much, just hanging out
Done anything cool lately
Not really, but I'm looking forward to seeing the new Wonder Woman movie
Really? Why would you want to see that?
Well, I like super hero movies and this one has really good reviews
No way! A super hero movie with good reviews?!
Yes way. Look it up on Rotten Tomatoes.
Okay, I'll trust your story. Any idea why it's so good.
No, that's why I want to see it.
Any big stars in it?
Chris Pine and Gal Godot
I don't recognize those names
Chris Pine was in Star Trek
Oh yeah, I remember him
And Gal Godot was in the Fast and Furious
Hmmm...still not ringing any bells
Well, go check it out
Okay, maybe I will
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite movie?
That's tough! Do you have one.
I actually don't think I do, now that you mention it.
Yeah, I definitely don't have one favorite, but could pick one favorite from each category.
Good idea- let's start there! What's your favorite comedy?
I like the classics. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is definitely one.
Good choice! Have you seen Due Date? It's kind of an unofficial remake
It is? I've never seen it. Sounds awesome!
Zach Galifinakis from the Hangover is in it.
He's absolutely hilarious, I'll have to check it out! What's your favorite comedy?
Now that we're on the subject, probably Due Date actually!
Ok, I definitely have to see this movie now.
I can lend it to you if you want- I have it on DVD!
Sounds great! I'll lend you another one in return.
Sweet!
Actually a movie swap sounds like a great idea.
It does!
Let's get a group together and make this an event!
My roommates all loe movies, I'll mention it to them.
Sweet!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like an old person when I listen to the radio.
Why?
Because I think thoughts like "This isn't music. In my day, we had the real music."
Yeah. I can relate. You are having a "get off my lawn" moment.
Yes. I do honestly feel like music was much better a couple decades ago, but maybe I am crazy.
Maybe everybody feels this way.
My parents definitely said it to me.
Yeah. Mine as well.
I liked my parents music very much, though.
What kind of stuff did they listen to?
A lot of mellow stuff that might be considered cheesy by some, but I grew up listening to it, so I love it.
Like what?
I love, love, love The Carpenters. My mom liked them.
Karen Carpenter had the voice of an angel.
Agreed. Her voice and they lyrics. Top notch stuff. Also, my mom had a lot of Simon and Garfunkel albums which I deeply love.
Oh yeah. They wrote many good tunes.
We had a lot of bad pop music back when I was a kid in the eighties, you know, but there just seemed to be far more variety on the radio.
Yeah. You could hear r&b, rap, heavy metal and pop all on the same station.
Totally. I miss that.
There are still many great artists making music, you just have to search for them. Radio has gotten pretty bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how have yo been doing?
I've been doing well! How about you?
Pretty good, see any good movie or go to any good concert recently?
No concerts, but I did see a great movie last night!
Oh really? What movie was that?
It was Baywatch, a very funny movie.
I think I saw the trailer for that, who stars in it?
I has The Rock and Zach Efron.
Oh I love both of those actors.
They were great in the movie they have good chemistry.
I want to see Baywatch, I was a fan of the show.
It is different than the show, but very funny.
What would you compare it too then?
Probably 21 Jump street, it has the hilarious buddy cop feel to it.
That sounds very interesting, I will check it out.
You will love it I am sure.
Have you seen anything else recently?
No, I am waiting for a good horror movie to come out soon.
IT should be coming out eventually.
Yeah I am excited for that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Howdy!
Heya! How's it going?
Well thanks, and you?
Pretty good. What have you been up to?
Oh... not much... work and sleep take up most of my time. Try to squease in a movie here and there when I can though.
Pretty much the same for me. Seen any good movies lately?
Depends. Do you mean on video or in theaters?
Either. Dvd first I guess - always looking for recommendations for my collection.
In that case I've recently rewatched my favorite movies for the umpteenth time.
And they are....
Donnie Darko, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, Stardust, Warm Bodies, Southland Tales, Rushmore, and Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back.
Oh! I LOVE Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back! Did you hear about the sequel?
Of course. HUGE Kevin Smith fan.
Me too. My favorite two of his are Clerks, a true cinematic classic, and a tossup between Mallrats and Dogma.
Dogma is hilarious. It used to be the movie I used to introduce my friends to his works.
Used to? What do you use now?
For my more mature friends Clerks but otherwise Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back since it's modern, has an AMAZING cast, and it's absolute hilarious.
But what about me? You started me with Mallrats.
Dude, that movie is so us though.
Snoogins. Would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey How are you doing today?
I am doing great! Yourself?
Awesome, I stayed up late last night watching a movie called The thing called love.
Oh, I heard of that movie ?Is it old ?
Yes, it is fairly old now.
Who is in it?
The late Rive Phoenix, Samantha Mathis, and Sandra Bullock
oh, I remember River Phoenix so cute and so talented.  What a tragedy.
I think it was made right before River Phoenix died and before Sandra Bullock became famous.
Sandra Bullock is an great actress.  What is it about?
A big city new york girl follwoing her dreams to be a country star.
Did they play any good country music?
Yes Trisha Yearwood was in a lot of it with her songs.
oh, what music does she write ?
She wrote the song I can't understand.
Oh, I know that song.  I love that song!
She also has the song A perfect love out now.  But its not in the movie.
That is a great song I really like that one too!
You should definitly look into streaming The thing called love its underated.
Ok, I will look into watching that this weekend. Thanks !!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey I just watched that new Guardians movie.
Really? Me too, what you think of it?
It was good, but the music was the best.
Yes! That movie had the best soundtrack.
The last one did too, the first one.
I think it may have been better. Which one had better music to you?
The second one. They seemed to have more songs you know, really had some good dance numbers.
I would watch it again just to hear the music.
I love when the song fits the scene, you know?
I liked Groot dancing, perfect imagery, in the first scene of the movie.
There is a scene in Xmen First class, with Quicksilver.
Where he saves people while wearing headphones?
That is the one. It was one of those movie moments where the music fit so well.
That whole scene was just amazing.
I liked the movie. I felt they really did it well, putting the feel of the time in it.
I think the new Xmen have a lot of potential.
I can not wait to see the new ones.
How cool would it be if they had some of the songs of the 80's in it?
Like Love is a Battlefield?
Yes! Some real eighties feel songs, you know?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello! Long time no see!
Hey man, it's been awhile!
You done anything cool lately?
Well, I don't know how cool it is, but I saw a great movie last night.
Which one, maybe I've seen it?
Um, Hidden Figures?
Oh yes! That movie should have won the Oscars it was nominated for, it was fantastic.
Wasn't it great? I thought it was super well done.
The scripting and the casting was fantastic.
That scene where Katherine chews out her coworkers for having to run across campus was so good.
Yeah. I know it was based on a true story, so I wonder if that was true.
Her running across town? Yeah, I know that part was.
No, I meant that the coworkers actually listened and changed.
Oh. Yeah, I don't know about that.
It just makes me so mad to think about the fact that they even made the coffee part different for "coloreds."
Racism is messed up, man.
I'm glad that movie was made. It did a good job of recognizing those people.
We've white washed a lot of history, unfortunately.
Well, hopefully the actors will get more roles after this, I enjoyed all of them.
Taraji especially was amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey hows it going?
Fine, how are you?
Good. how was your weekend?
It was fantastic, I went to the beach with the misses.
Oh that's sounds splendid, hows is she?
She's good. She's never been better.
Have you guys seen the new Beauty and the Beast. It's wonderful. I highly recommend it.
Oh no, we wanted to see it but haven't got along to it.
It's great, Emma Watson was great.
Oh I love her, she's my favorite actress.
Mine as well.
Have you seen her in Regression?
No. Was it good?
Phenomenal. You should check it out.
Oh i think I will.
It's definitely a keeper.
Maybe I'll jsut buy it then!
Do it, you won't regret it.
Thanks for the recommendation.
You as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Train is coming to Jiffy Lube Live?
Do you like them?
They're okay. The tickets are discounted... only $15.
For lawn seats?
Yeah. Normally $25.
What songs do they do? I know I should know them but nothing is coming to mind.
Drops of Jupiter was HUGE years ago.
Yeah, I think I remember that.
It was everywhere. Unavoidable!
Yeah, that's an okay song.
I kind of like "Hey Soul Sister", too.
That's fun to dance to.
Exactly.
I could see them. Especially at that price, it could be fun.
That's my thinking.
When is it?
Next Saturday.
Yeah, let's do it. Want to grab some dinner first?
Sure! How about we meet at your place since it's on the way.
Works for me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Some kind of weather we've been having lately.
No kidding; one minute it's pouring and the next minute it's scorching!
Yeah, it reminds me of that song about extremes.
Which song is that?
It's the one where the singer says something like you're hot and you're cold.
You're yes and you're no?
Yeah that's the one! Who's it by?
I think that's a Katy Perry song.
You're in then you're out... yeah, that's a fun song.
Hard to believe it came out almost ten years ago.
Wait, really??
Yeah, it came out in 2008.
Wow. Whatever happened to her?
Actually her next album's about to come out.
No kidding! What's it called?
Witness, it's supposed to come out June 9th.
Huh. Didn't she have a single come out recently for it?
Yeah, Chained to the Rhythm.
I knew it! I'll have to check it out, she has some good songs.
Well, she's kinda hit or miss, but yeah, you should.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How is your day going?
Good, been relaxing and checking out movies all day.
Find any good ones.
I just watched the new Beauty and the Beast.
What did you think?
I thought it was breathtaking.
It is a real masterpiece. What did you think of the way they kept singing?
The music?It was amazing, I wanted to replay the songs over and over.
Not too much?
It was a musical, so no. I loved the way they bent the story into song.
They did have alot of the plot displayed in the music.
It was a real twist on itself, like fresh.
I liked the way the personalities of the characters came out in the music.
The songs were amazing.
Did you like the old cartoon version.
Of course. But it was not as deep.
This one had more feel. The music was more mature.
I still sing the songs in my head.
I know the feeling. Did you think the actors sung well.
Tale as old as time was a real beauty, yes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey. How's it going?
Great. It's good to see you again.
It's been a while since I've seen you.
Yeah. It's been about six years.
What ever happened with your girlfriend?
We actually got married and had a little boy.
How old is your son now?
He's five and has completely taken over control of the house.
I hear you. When my son turned four, he started commandeering the TV remote control.
Yes, my kid has done that too! We never watch what we want anymore because he'll throw a tantrum.
Haha! That's exactly what happens to us.
The worst thing is when I want to watch a movie. He won't let me.
Yeah, that's very hard to put up with. The other night, I wanted to watch Captain America, but we had to watch Paw Patrol for the umpteenth time instea.
I know exactly what you mean. If my wife and I want to watch a movie at home, we have to wait til late night when our boy goes to sleep.
Right. And it's hard to enjoy a nice movie when you have to be awake in six hours for work.
I hear you loud and clear!
But i just want my son to be happy. And at least we spend time together watching his shows.
Yes, soon enough he'll be off doing his own thing.
Well, it was great to see you again. It ws great to catch up with you.
Likewise. And I look forward to movie time soon, haha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Howdy. What's up?
Not much. Just hanging around my house.
I was thinking of renting some videos.
What kind?
Just some old movies. Want to come over?
Yeah, I could do that.
I'm getting some black and white movies, if that's ok.
That sounds terrific. Which ones?
I planned on getting "Casablanca" and maybe another one like that.
That's a great start.
I like Bogart, so maybe I'll get another one of his.
Bogart was awesome, but I don't know many of his movies.
Well, he's got plenty of them.
Like what?
There's some detective movies of his, like "The Big Sleep" and "The Maltese Falcon."
Oh yeah, I saw "The Maltese Falcon." It was great.
Have you seen "The Big Sleep" yet? I could get that one.
No, I haven't. Sounds like a good one to get.
Ok, I'll get "Casablanca" and "The Big Sleep."  Meet me at my house at 7:00 tonight?
Perfect. See you then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how are things going for you today?
Pretty good, how about you?
Things are good, just enjoying the early days of summer
Yeah, me too
Seen any good movies lately?
Not, really, how about you?
I saw the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie?
Oh yeah, how was that?
It was horrible
Really?! I thought it would be pretty good.
No, it was bad. Disney needs to kill that franchise
Yeah, I suppose it's become a little worn.
Oh yeah, Johnny Depp's character is way over kill now.
Yeah, they've milked that character pretty good now.
I remember when the first one came out.
Yeah, what year was that?
2003. A while back now
Wow, that was a while ago.
Yeah, but I guess the new one is still making money.
Oh for sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever really listened to movie soundtracks.
I mean, I am sure I have just never really thought on it.
I have been. And wow, some are just amazing.
I have liked some songs from movies
I just watched Tron, the listened to the songs. They were really good.
I do not think I have even seen that movie.
The new one is really good, hi tech stuff.
The effect are better than the older one I imagine?
For sure. The effects are out of this world.
I like really hi-tech movies. Like the Matrix.
Love that show. You know I really was not into the music on that film .
I do not even know any of its songs. There has only been one I can think that I listened to the music.
Which is that?
It was the one with heath ledger where he plays a Knight.
A Knight's Tale?
That is the one. Set long ago, but with rock music.
I loved the way they did that.
Made the movie have an edgy feel.
He also played in another Knight movie.
The Dark Knight?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the movie about Biggie?
You mean the rapper?
Yes his name is biggie.
Yes I know, Notorious BIG.
Yes thats the guy.
No I never watched it.
It was one of the greatest movies ever.
You really think so?
Yes, even people that new him were reported to have liked it.
Wow it was that good.
Yes I watched it five times.
Wow you must of really liked it.
Yes it got all the details correct.
Why did you watch it five times.
It is so much fun, there is a lot going on.
Wow what do you mean.
You have to watch it to really understand.
Ok I will give it a chance.
You wont regret it.
Ok thank you for letting me know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey
What's going on in your world?
Oh, nothing much, saw a pretty good movie the other day
Oh yeah, what was it?
Bone Tomahawk
Bone Tomahawk? That sounds interesting.
Oh yeah, it was REALLY interesting.
Any big names in it?
Yes, Kurt Russell is the big name and then the guy from Lost
Which guy from Lost?
The main guy. Jack what's his name?
Oh, Matthew Fox.
Yeah, that's it.
So should I go see the movie?
I think so, but be forewarned that it's quite graphic in some parts.
Okay and the rest of the movie?
It's like an old western chase/hunt movie
Oh, sounds interesting
Yes indeed
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you own any guitar pedals?
Just one.
Would you like to buy a few of mine?
Sure which ones?
I'm selling the distortion, and the glass house.
How much for the glass house?
I'll let that one go for$30
Cool, I'll take it.
Did you know the guys from rage uses that guitar pedal?
I did
I really like that one, but I need the money.
Why? What's up?
I'm going to a concert next week, but I don't have money to drink.
Oh, who's playing.
Morrissey
That slob?
Yeah, but it takes me back
You when?
The good old days.
I understand
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hows things?
Not too bad.
Plans for the weekend?
Not real sure.
Want to come over and listen to some tunes?
That sounds alright.
Cool!
Throw on some of the oldies?
But goodies!
No doubt!
No, not that band!
I was just agreeing to "goodies".
Ha! My bad!
But what wrong with No Doubt.
Nothing. Just don't care for Gwenn.
Well, not these days, but she used to be pretty good.
Till she got into Hip Hop.
More...Pop.
Well, whatever it is, I don't like it.
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I got 2 tickets to see Hello Dolly on June 21st for my birthday.
Really? Who gave them to you?
A former student of mine who's in the cast.
It's so nice when students remember us after all these years.
Yeah, he was a talented hard working kid.
Are they good seats?
Oh yeah, 7th row center orchestra.
Nice. Those are worth a fortune
For sure, but he gets comps.
Either way, what a great gift.
He knows Bette Midler is my favorite singer/actor of all time.
Everyone knows that.
David Hyde Pierce is playing Horace.
I remember him from the tv show Fraser.
Me too, but he's been a Broadway actor, singer for a long time.
What theatre is Hello Dolly playing in?
The Shubert, such a great theatre.
Agreed. The last musical we saw there was Matilda.
So, do we have a date to see Dolly?
Definitely. I can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Good morning!
Good morning to you; how are you?
Just fine! Woke up to a groovin' song on my iPhone.
What's your alarm?
I have it linked with my Google Play, so just whatever top 40 song is up next.
What was today's?
"Something Just Like This" by the Chainsmokers.
Nice, I love the Chainsmokers!
Me too, they have such an energetic beat to them.
Indeed, though I think I'd hate to have that as my alarm.
Oh? What do you use?
I like to wake up peacefully, so I usually play a soft soundtrack piece.
Really? Like what?
Well, lately I've been using the theme from Finding Nemo.
Whoa, that's so soft. That would never wake me!
It works for me, and I love soundtrack pieces, so.
Do you have a favourite composer?
I love Howard Shore's stuff.
He did the Lord of the Rings soundtrack, right?
Yeah, he's a genius.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just caught the tale end of some show called Meet Joe Black.
With Brad Pitt.
Yes! I had never even seen it before.
That movie is really under rated, the film, the score.
I only seen bits of it, but it was really deep.
It is a sort of dark but also not so much film. The way they add the music in makes you feel the love and suspense. At least, what I saw.
The happy, but not really, ending. Anthony Hopkins did well in that movie.
He is always so out there and odd, in a good way.
Like Silence of the Lambs.
Yep, the way he plays those movies, he makes them classics.
The kind of shows that keep me thinking about them after they end, I always love finding them.
This one movie I watched, called pay it Forward was like that.
With Kevin Spacey?
Yeah, it made me think a lot. Had some really good tunes too.
I do not recall the music, but I remember the song giving me a feeling, know what I mean?
I do. That sort of emotion you can not place, I think that is sometimes from the music.
I think it might be. Maybe that is why we all recall cartoons so well.
I can sing every Disney movie song by heart.
I think that might be the point, nostaligia.
Maybe they make them knowing we will still love the music twenty years later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's up? Are you glad it's Friday.
I'm so glad. I'm so ready for the weekend.
Yeah? Are you doing anything interesting?
I might go and see a movie.
Is there anything good playing?
There's a lot out, actually.
Yes. I've been seeing a lot of movie trailers lately.
Yep. There's Wonderwoman, Pirates of the Carribean, Guardians of the Galaxy and a bunch more.
Well, Wonderwoman is a bit of a change, I guess.
Yeah. I kind of feel like they just keep remaking old movies.
Yes. They remake them or do sequels constantly.
Wonderwoman hasn't really been done in such a long time.
Also, there's the Aquaman movie.
I heard about that. It's supposed to be a whole new twist on that superhero.
Yes, and they haven't really done an Aquaman movie yet.
He has dark hair and looks completely different for the new movie.
It's funny how far they've come with superhero movies.
They've been making them since those old black and white Superman movies.
Think of all the money they spend to make one of those movies these days.
Yeah. It's hard to imagine they even spent much money on Superman's costume in those old black and white movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there, how's it going?
Hey! I'm good thanks, how about you?
Things are good. I just got back from work.
Same here. Did you get caught in that traffic jam earlier?
Yeah, you too? It took me 20 minutes longer to get home.
Me too. I hate how much traffic builds up on Fridays.
So any plans for the weekend?
Yeah a group of us are going to the movie theater.
Sounds fun. Which movie are you seeing?
We're checking out the new Marvel movie.
Guardians of the Galaxy 2?
Yeah, the one with Chris Pratt. I loved the first Guardians of the Galaxy.
Me too. Dave Bautista's character was my favorite.
He was great. I'm excited to see Kurt Russell in this new one.
Have you seen the trailers for it?
Yeah the trailer is great. I'm expecting this movie to be a lot of fun.
I hope the soundtrack is as good as the one in the first movie.
Me too. The soundtrack was one of my favorite things about the first movie.
So far I've only heard good things.
A friend of mine saw it last week and really liked it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, how are you?
I'm great. How are you? What did you do over the weekend?
I'm good. I took my family to the movies to see the new Diary of a Winpy Kid Movie.
Oh, Diary of a Wimpy Kid the Long Haul, right?
That's the one.
What did you think?
It really wasn't very good. They have an entirely new cast and the previous cast was much better than the current one.
Oh really? That's too bad. I read that it received a rating of around 17 percent on rotten tomatoes.
Unfortunately, I read that after I had already watched it in the theater.
Doesn't Alicia Silverstone play the mother?
Yes, she does. Every time I saw her, I thought about that movie she was in a long time ago, Clueless.
I loved that movie!
Me too, it was fantastic.
What year was Clueless released? I can't remember.
Clueless came out in 1995 I think. I remember because I know what grade I was in at the time.
Paul Rudd was great in that movie too.
I agree, he played her step brother. The one she ended up being in love with at the end.
Yes, I hadn't seen that coming at the beginning.
Well, it was fun to reminisce about a great 90s movie but getting back to Diary of a Winpy Kid, I would skip it if I were you.
Thanks, I will. I'll wait for the next family movie to come out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there
Hi
What do you want to talk about?
What about movies?
Okay that sounds good.
You see anything good lately?
Not really, I want to go to the movie theater soon.
I plan on going this weekend to watch boss baby
That looks funny
It does, I'm taking my kids
I'm sure they will love it.
I hope so
I want to see pirates of the Caribbean
That looks good too
It does and I love Johnny Depp
Who doesnt?
That's true
He's so hott,and such a good actor.
He is
He makes the whole movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched an interesting movie last night.
What was it about?
It was about hiking and climbing mountains.
Oh wow that is a difficult task.
Yes this is the most incredible story.
Is it based on a true story?
Yes it is.
Those are my favorite types of movies.
It is about a hiker named Joe Simpson who nearly died climbing a mountain.
Wow that sounds dramatic.

Ok thanks for informing me about all this.
Yes, if you like climbing, or even if not, this is a good film.
Ok I appreciate your recommendation.

Wow, you have very different taste in music than I do.

I love classical music.
Interesting. Who is your favorite composer?
Beethoven. He is a genius.

Hi, have you seen any good action movies lately?
No, I haven't but I do plan to see the new Wonder Woman movie.
When is Wonder Woman releasing in the U.S.?
It's releasing tomorrow on June, 2nd. I'm planning to go for the late night show.
Who is the main star in the movie?
Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman. She is the tall and beautiful actress and model.
Isn't Chris Pine in Wonder Woman too?
I think he is, and so is Robin Wright, she's a legendary actress.
Does this movie have a theme music or a song?
It does, I recently saw it on YouTube, it's by Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL.
Has Sia sung a song too for the movie?
Yes, Sia sang the song, "To Be Human" along with the singer Labrinth.
Is the story based on the superhero theme?
Yes, of course, it's based off of the DC Comics character.
Which other action movie did you watch recently?
I saw "The Fate of the Furious" not too long ago.
Did that movie do well in the box office?
Oh, yeah, it did make something like one billion dollars the first week itself.
Is this movie a sequel to the Fast and Furious franchise?
I believe it is the eight movie that was made in the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I finally saw the Avengers Age of Ultron last night.
I haven't even see it yet. Did you like it?
No, I didn't like it. I LOVED it. Seriously, one of the best movies ever! You have to see it.
You sound so sure, ha ha. Well, I'll definitely watch it later then.
I haven't seen a good horror movie in a long time. Do you know any good ones?
Well, my mom just saw Crimson Peak.
How did she like it?
She said it was okay. Not too bad of a movie. Why don't you come over and we can watch it together?
Sure, okay. I'll go pick up some snacks!
Hey, I just saw this really good movie last night. It was so dramatic!
What was the name of it?
Everest. You should watch it sometime.
I think I just might.
So I just heard about this really weird movie. But it's good.
A good weird movie? You caught my interest. What is it?
It's called Ex Machina. It's about human-like robots!
hmm, you are right, that DOES sound weird. I'll watch it when I get the chance.
Hey did you wanna see Fifty Shades of Grey with me?
The  erotic romance movie based off the novel? Sure, let's go sometime tomorrow afternoon.
I'll order the tickets now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you up to this weekend?
Not much, probably Netflix binging.
That;s my usual too!
Why do you ask?
I know there's a music festival downtown this weekend, and I was thinking of going.
Oh, yeah! I wish I could. I'm sure tickets are sold out though.
They are, but I'm working at it so I have free passes!
Are you kidding me!?
No! Come with me to see Modest Mouse live!
That would be amazing. They've been one of my favorite bands since middle school. Who else is playing?
I know alt-J is.
Another fave! Totally in!
Good, cause I don't remember any of the other performers.
That's funny!
The lineup is supposed to be good.
Yeah, I've heard ads on the radio and remember it sounding good.
I love all alternative music.
Me too! I'm so looking forward to it, and I'm so glad I have someone to go with me.
Yeah, it'll be a great weekend.
Sounds great, let's meet Friday at 12.
XXXXXXXXXXX
He man!
How's it going?
Not too bad. You?
The same.
What you doing this weekend?Riding on the wake of Amazon's Oscar gold, I'd assume.
Think I'm gonna make it a Netflix weekend.
Watching anythin in particular?
Nah, just gonna surf around.
I hear you.
Netflix has been making a lot of originals lately.
Riding on the wake of Amazon's Oscar gold, I'd assume.
What do you mean.
That movie that Casey Aflec won for.
Huh?
Manchester by the Sea.
Oh, yeah. Was that an Amazon flick
Sure was.
That's so strange.
I agree.
What ever will the big studios do?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how are you today?
I am great how have things been?
I've been into watching some new movies lately.
Really what kind have you been seeing?
I saw that new Wonder Woman movie yesterday?
Really, where did you see it?
At the local AMC theater near my house.
Did you like it?
Yes, it was really good.
Do you like woman action heroes?
Yes, I am into the whole woman empowerment movement.
I heard there were screenings that only woman were allowed into.
Yes, that's true bit not around here.
Have you seen anything else lately?
Yes, I saw the Baywatch movie the other day.
How was it?
I thought it was kind of silly.
Oh, why so?
It was kind of a cheap knockoff of the old series, should have known.
Yes, well, that happens with these kind of movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I'm looking for a fun little comedy to watch. Do you have anything to recommend?
Actually yes. We just watched one last weekend.
What was it called?
Masterminds. It's with a bunch of very funny people like Zach Galifianakis, Kristen Wiig, and others.
Was it really funny or kinda dumb?
Both at the same time actually. It was really silly, but I laughed a lot.
It's not too crass in terms of humor?
No, not at all. It's not that kind of teenage humor oriented toward body parts.
Good, cause I get tired quickly of that.
No, it's really funny. It's about a naive and somewhat dumb Loomis employee who is convinced to steal a truckload of money (literally) by a work crush.
Classic heist movie, with a comedy treatment?
Something like that. But of course most of them are really dumb, or not too forward thinking at the very least.
Sounds like it could be fun. Anyone else that I know in that movie?
Jason Sudeikis plays the part of a hilarious Southern hitman.
I love Jason Sudeikis!
Well you'll love him in that because he's a riot. It's a character bit, and it's highly ridiculous, but he makes it work beautifully.
Oh wow - I'll watch it!
Otherwise, we watched Christmas office Party recently. But it wasn't as funny, although I kinda liked it.
Nah... We watched it and my girlfriend fell asleep after five minutes.
Yeah... my husband did the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard a great new song today.
Oh really? Which one?
"Holding On" by The War on Drugs.
I love that band, I didn't know they had a new song out.
It was just released this morning.
Awesome, so does this mean a new album is on the way as well?
Yes, it's called "A Better Understanding".
Terrific news! Any word on when it will be coming out?
The album will be released on August 25.
I can't wait! Their last album was so good.
I know, it had a nostalgic throwback sound but still sounded contemporary.
Yeah, some clear Dire Straits and Tom Petty influences, but distinct at the same time.
Have you heard any good new music lately?
I think my favorite new song is "Fool's Errand" by Fleet Foxes.
Good pick, they sound as good as ever.
Yeah, I'm just thrilled that they're back from their hiatus.
And their album is out soon, right?
Yes, on June 16.
Awesome - it seems like this summer will be a great one for music.
I can't wait to check out some shows!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there

So what do you say

See you soon then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Long time, no see...
Yes, it's great to catch up with you again.
What have you been doing with all your time lately?
I have been watching a good bit of music videos on Youtube.
Really?  I didn't know they had free music videos.
Yes, they are completely free to watch and listen to.
I will have to try that.  I just love watching old music videos.
Me too.  It brings me back to my teenage years.
Old music videos from the 1980's make me laugh.
They are interesting to watch because I like to look at how they used to dress.
I like to watch that and remember how we used to do our hair.
It can be so much fun to remember those older times.
Not only with music, but its fun to remember the older movies too.
I agree.  The special effects in the older movies make me laugh.
I remember when we thought the special effects in those movies were top-notch.
So much has changed.
Back then, we would have never dreamed of the technology we have today when it comes to movies.
It really is fun to compare old and new movies.
It was great talking to you.
Same here.  Have a great day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello,  how have you been?
Not too bad...and you?
Doing well.  Got any good news?!
Not really...but I saw an outstanding movie yesterday?
Oh really?  Which one?
Table 19.
Oh, I think I saw the trailer for that on youtube!
Yea, that's how I first heard about it!
So what made it so enjoyable?
For starters, I love Anna Kendrick.
Me too!
The movie itself also have a great supporting cast and was heartwarming and funny!
Who else was in it?
Well, Stephen Merchant for one thing.
Yea, he's excellent!
Sure is!  He was great in the movie.
Sweet.  So what other movies would you compare it to?
It was a wedding comedy so maybe Wedding Crashers...and a bit like the Breakfast Club in places!
Dang.  That's high praise!
Yes, you really have to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, how have you been?
Good man, good to see you.
Same! I've been meaning to tell you about this band that I think you'll love.
Ooooh, I always love getting recommendations from you. Hit me.
The band is called Elder.
Never heard of them; what are they like?
They're basically like doom metal, which I know you love, but they're a little bit proggy too.
I kind of hate prog rock though.
I promise, you'll like these guys. The prog elements are pretty subtle and they just give you a nice break from all of the riffs.
OK, fair enough, I'll check them out.
What else have you been listening to?
Lots of Fleet Foxes, believe it or not.
Oh yeah? You were into them a while ago, I remember.
Yeah, I kind of burned out on them and that sort of folk-y stuff, but I think it's been enough time that I'm ready to get back into it.
You know they have a new one coming out soon, right?
Yeah, that's kind of what got me back into them. I'm pretty pumped about that new one.
Which album of theirs should I start with if I was going to check them out?
I'd start with the first one, the self titled one. It's solid.
Cool, I'll check it out.
You should - I think you'll like them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, did you ever see Dragon Heart?
With Sean Connery?
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah, it was pretty good.
I thought so too.
Did you know they made a sequel?
No. They did?
Yup.
How was it?
Terrible!
Could have figured.
They didn't even have any of the original cast.
I don't think Connery does sequals.
Yeah, none come to mind.
My favorite character in the original was Dennis Quaid.
He is pretty darn good.
He doesn't do much these days.
Yeah, sad.
He's such a good actor.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I found this new genre of music..
New genre? what do you mean?
It's called vaporwave, It's like an internet subculture.
Internet subculture?
Yeah, like a trend that started on the internet.
So what kind of music is this?
It's kind of like oversampled 80's music, slowed down, with lots of sound effects and samples from movies and TV shows, but there's lots of subgenres that pull from many sources.
It sounds kind of interesting, but also weird.
it is weird, but it grew on me quickly, plus a lot of the samples are already catchy or popular songs from 20-40 years ago.
I guess I should check it out, sounds like it could be nostalgic in a weird way.
You definitely should, and nostalgia is one of the underlying themes of the music. Aesthetic memes and culture is all a visual element as well.
So it's like a musical meme?
Kind of, its such a multifaceted thing that it's not contained within a box.
Can you recommend some aesthetics or vaporwaves?
The first go to for everyone is the multiple performing names of this one girl. Blank banshee, macintosh plus, and vektroid.
Is there anything closer to mainstream?
I would suggest Pepsi Saint or Skylar Spence who are the same person.
Are there any free ways or easy ways to hear this?
I strongly suggest youtube over a music subscription as a lot of content contains copyrighted material and has not been signed or professionally produced.
well, thanks a lot for the impromptu music suggestions, shoot me a text later bro!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
What have you been up to?
Oh, I've been watching Jim Carrey movies. He's my favorite actor!
Oh, that's unfortunate.
Why is it unfortunate?
He's going to be going to trial soon for providing his ex-girlfriend with a lethal dose of drugs.
Oh. I didn't know that.
And there was also the whole anti-vaccine thing.
The anti-what thing?
You know, when he was Jenny McCarthy's boyfriend. he went along with her whole vaccines cause autism thing.
Well, I didn't know that either.
Still going to watch those movies?
Yeah, but you don't have to go and spoil them for me!
Well, just letting you know.
I didn't really need to know to be honest.
Well, now you do.
He's still my favorite actor.
He shouldn't be.
Go away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, how have you been?
I'm fine thanks, what about you?
I'm good! Been up to much lately?
yea, kind of
I saw a movie the other night, it was pretty scary
Oh yeah? Wich one?
Blair Witch Project
Wow, that´s a very old movie
yeah it is, but I never had the chance to watch it until that day
Whre you alone?
I was, that´s why I was scared
I never watch scary movies alone.
I really liked the movie
It´s a good movie
Have you watched a scary movie lately?
yes, I watch the other day Anabelle
Oh my God, that´s one is scary as hell
Indeed, there are 2 more of that type right?
I guess, lest´s watch them together
sure that´s an excellent idea
XXXXXXXXXXX
Music in movie trailers these days is awful.
I know right? So cliche.
Its always ending with the huge scary robot noise.
Thanks inception.
It was there before that! Even michael bay was doing it with transformers.
Media is dying a slow death.
And the special effects. Does anyone know how to puppet anymore?
Everything looks fake these days.
Star wars though, they knew what they were doing.
Were they? I didnt see it.
Oh man, you have got to check it out!
Why?
They used legit old puppets and stuff like the old films!
Oh snap!
I know! Its super cool.
You changed my mind for sure.
Yeah its pretty great. A diamond in the rough.
Yeah, not much treasure out these days.
Nothing good in theaters at all.
Lets just watch nickelodeon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you do this weekend?
Nothing much really. Listened to some music and watched a movie.
Cool. What did you see?
I watched Jaws.
Had you ever seen it before?
No actually, I missed it when I was a kid.
What did you think?
It was scary!
No it is not. That movie looks so fake.
You're crazy. The shark looks so real.
Are you scared to go in the water now?
Nope. I'll be brave.
What music did you listen to this weekend?
The new Bruno Mars album.
How is it? Should I check it out?
It's great. Lots of fun, but very poppy.
He's a big pop star. I expected that from it.
I totally suggest checking it out though.
I will. His last single was a great song.
I agree. It did so well on the charts too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello. What's up?
Hey. Nothing much. Have you seen any good movies lately.
No, not really. I just saw "Life" and I thought it was pretty bad.
I don't know that movie. What is it about?
It's about some astronauts who intercept a capsule that has some alien.
It's a scifi movie.
Yes. I usually like this type movie, but this one not so much.
Really? Why not?
It was just such a bad series of events and unrealistic things I couldn't overlook.
Like what?
Well, the expert on alien life was playing with the alien like a pet for one thing.
That's funny.
At one point the alien seems to be in stasis or hibernating and the idiot electro shocks it.
Wow. That's funny.
Yes, the alien get's angry and attacks the guy.
I don't blame it.
This is the first movie ever where I actually wanted everyone to die.
That's funny.
They were really so incompetent and so many stupid things.
I think I'll pass on this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how are you today?
Hi, I'm good. The weather is great.
I agree, have you had a good month?
Yeah, it's been pretty good anything new with you?
I'm going to see Kasey Chambers next week, pretty excited about that.
Never heard of her, what's she sing?
She's not very popular so not many people have heard of her, country folk music.
I thought you didn't like country?
I don't but her music just spoke to me at the right time.
What do you mean by that?
Well one of the lyrics was "we're all gonna die someday."
That sounds really dark.
Nah, it's a really cheery song you should listen to it sometime.
Maybe I will, it sounds interesting.
In that song one of the lyrics is "it hurts down here cause we're running out of beer, but we're all gonna die someday."
That's a really funny lyric. Sounds like I might like the humor in it.
Even if you don't like country you'd probably like her, just like me.
I'll be sure to wear my cowboy hat when I listen to her.
You know I'll be wearing mine at the show!
Yee haw! Go get 'em cowboy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what are you up to?
Hey, I almost didn't hear you.  I was listening to music.
It's no problem at all.  What are you listening to?
I'm listening to Rihanna's greatest hits.
I had no idea you were such a fan.
She's one of my favorites.
I remember when her album, 'Good Girl Gone Bad' first came out.
You know that was exactly a decade ago?
Wow, time really flies.
She's done so much since then.
Her sound has evolved so much.
Even the difference between 'Good Girl Gone Bad' and 'Loud' was so significant, but only a few years apart.
Even track by track, she can go from delicate to intense.  Her 'Anti' album has some great examples of this.
What's your favorite track from 'Anti?'
'Desperado' is the coolest track on the album.
I can listen to that song all day.
I really love the Western style of it.
I want to see her in concert.
We'll have to get tickets for her next tour, because I'd go to that too.
It's settled.  Next album Rihanna releases, we'll be there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up?
Not much, you?
Oh the usual, but I have a funny story for you.
Oh?
Yeah, my husband was listening to music the other day on YouTube, while I was blowing bubbles for our son.
Kay...
Well, he's just started talking, and "You're welcome" is one of the things he's saying.
Your husband?
No, my son silly.
Ha ha ha, I knew that.
Anyway, the "You're Welcome" song comes up as part of the mix.
The one from "Moana."
Yeah, that The Rock sings.
He's so cool!
Anyway, my son bolts for the computer and watches the whole song even repeating, "You're Welcome," a few times.
That's so cute.
Speaking of The Rock, do you plan to see the "Baywatch" movie.
I like The Rock, but that one looks stupid.
I wasn't going to see it in theaters with the other stuff I'd rather see, but I miht rent it when it comes out.
Check it out from the library, and then it would be free.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's goin' on, schmoopy?
What does it look like? I'm listening to my i-pod.
I-pod? Those are still around?
What can I say? I'm old school.
Ok, Old School. Whatta listening to?
Kiki Dee's Greatest Hits.
Did she do that "Chuck E.'s in Love" song?
That was Rickie Jones. Did you know that she was related to Davy Jones? Distant cousin.
If she's a distant cousin then it isn't likely that her last name would be the same so I think that's b.s.
It wasn't originally. It was Birkowitz. Rickie Birkowitz. She changed it when Mr. Davy became the man.
Right. So, did Kiki Dee actually have any hits?
She did that song with Elton John. You remember--"Don't Go Brokin' My Heart".
I hate that song. Anything else?
I don't have a copy of this but I think she did a duet with Tom Petty called something like "Even Losers Can Get Laid."
I'm a little suspicious of your sources. Where did you hear that?
Tiger Beat magazine.
Tiger Beat is still around? I thought it collapsed after Sean Cassidy was caught in that compromising position. Remember? When he had that clown costume on.
Nope, they still here and still tapped into the youth of the nation.
Anyway, back to Kiki Dee....
Oh, I'm off her now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how was your weekend?
Not bad.  How about yours?
Pretty good.  I saw a movie that I really enjoyed.
Which movie?
It was called 'Split.'
Is that an M. Night Shyamalan movie?
Yeah.  Starring James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy.
How was it?  I sort of lost faith in M. Night after 'The Last Airbender.'
This was really good.  I think it may be the comeback for M. Night.
It's about a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three girls right?
Yea.  It's really unique.
I'll check it out.  It can't be worse than 'Lady in the Water.'
That was such a bad movie.  Don't forget 'After Earth.'
That one was actually worse, and wasted Will Smith's talent.
It really was.  I can't say anything else about 'Split' without giving anything away, but there are connections with M. Night's previous films.
Now I'm really excited about it.  Who is Anya Taylor-Joy?
She was in the movie 'Barry' and in 'Witch.'
Oh, I saw 'Witch.'  She's incredibly talented.
She was perfect for this role.  Same with James McAvoy.
I am a big James McAvoy fan.  I will see the movie this weekend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, how are you today?
I am great, even though it's a Monday.
What did you do this weekend?
Not much, but I did go see Guardians of the Galaxy!
You mean the second one?
Yes, it was even more retro feeling than the first.  I loved it!
Was Chris Pratt  as fantastic in this one?
Yes, and there was a Baby Groot in the whole film.  He was adorable.
As adorable as Chris Pratt?
Not quite, but almost.  I think it was a good set up for the next movie as well.
What do you mean?  Guardians of the Galaxy 3?
Yes, either that or a huge tie in to the Avengers.  I'm just waiting for Thor to knock in at some point.
I could handle some Chris Hemsworth in a movie with Chris Pratt.
Yeah, that would be awesome.  You know how they are connected, right?
Not really, except they are all in the same universe or something like that.
There's these things called the Infinity Stones which a big bad guy called Thanos is trying to get.
Oh.  And the pair of Chris's are going to stop him?
Well, the two Chris's and about 70 other people, probably in a movie called Infinity War.
That's the next Avenger's movie?
Yes.  Anyway, go see  Guardians of the Galaxy 2, you'll love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about music and movies.
I'd rather talk about music in movies.
Ok. What do you got?
Have you noticed that movie soundtracks rarely have anything to do with the movie, or that the song playing never has anything to do with the scene?
Everyone has. But, since you brought it up, how about an example?
So the trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy uses that "Fox on the Run" song by Sweet.
Yep, I really have fond thoughts about that song. It really brings me back to when I was 7. Let's sing it....
Let's not. So the song is playing in the scene when the Dumpster Panda is trying to get Baby Groot not to push the wrong button.
So what?
Well, it just doesn't make any sense. First of all, Dumpster Panda is some sort of demented raccoon and not a fox. And it's not running from anything noway.
The tree thing was running.
Well, maybe the song should be dubbed to "Baby Groot Be Runnin."
You're an idiot. The song has nothing to do with a fox. It's kind of about a girl who is past her prime, not that I'd ever say any woman was passed her prime because women only get better as they age, or so I think.
Oh, of course. I agree completely. Sweet existed during a time when it was proper to make sexist and lewd comments at the expense of women. I'm glad those times are over, even if it meant the death of rock & roll.
So we are agreed? Women are ok in our book. I mean, after all, our mothers are women. And frankly, so are our sisters. I don't want to insult them. And most of the women on the planet are women as well.
Absolutely.
So what was the point of all this?
I kind of lost track, but I think it was that the movie soundtracks are arbitrary and the songs are only used to generate additional sales. And probably most of them are already in the public domain so they don't cost the producers nothin' to use.
Right. So someone picked up the rights to the Sweet song for cheap.
Exactly. And women are cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there! How are you doing today?
Fine, thanks, how about you?
I'm good, thanks. I just finished watching "Fury", have you ever seen that movie?
Is that the one with Brad Pitt in it?
Yes, it was a long movie, but probably one of the best war movies I've seen in awhile.
That's funny, because last week-end, my boyfriend really wanted me to watch it with him, but it was so long, I fell asleep!
You'll have to watch it again sometime, it's really good. But of course, anything with Brad Pitt in it has to be good!
Not necessarily.....he's had some bombs!
That's true. I recently saw the trailer for "Berlin Syndrome"; the leading actress is Teresa Palmer.
Not sure I've heard of that movie or the actress.
The movie is a thriller and looks really good. Teresa Palmer was also in "The Choice" and a lot of other good movies.
Oh yeah, gotcha, now I know who you mean. I'll have to watch the trailer to that, I like her too.
Sometimes I can't figure out if I like the actual movie better, or the songs that they play in the movies.
I was going to say the same thing, when you mentioned the movie "The Choice"!
Yes, I love that kind of music!
I have the soundtrack from the movie "The Choice"! There's a lot of classical music on there by Marcelo Zarvos.
Now you have me wanting to go watch it again, to listen to them more closely.
Do it! The songs are quite relaxing and take you to places that one can only dream of!
I'm going to the Video store later today to pick up a copy of it.
Better yet, just go out and buy the soundtrack; you won't be disappointed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new movie, Pirates of the Caribbean?
Is it the most recent one?
Yea! Dead Man Tell no Tales.
I have not! Was it good?
I really enjoyed it.  They have brought back some of the original actors.
Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley?
Yes, those two are the best.
I know! I'm excited to see it now.
What about the new Baywatch?
With Zac Efron and The Rock?
Yes that's it.
Hmm...not sure if I would like to see that one.
It seems like it's a very stereotypical movie.
I agree with you.
I'm excited to check out The Mummy!
Is that with Tom Cruise?
Yes, and Russell Crowe.
Those are some of my favorite actors!
Me too, I can't wait to check it out.
Let's go together!
XXXXXXXXXXX

Farewell!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, seen any good movies lately?
I have, and in fact, I am seeing one tomorrow that I hope will be good.
What movie are you going to see?
Wonder Woman!  I can not wait!
I have seen previews for that one!  Do you think it will be really good?
I hope so.  I really liked the character in the Batman vs Superman movie.
Me too!  She looked really tough and dangerous.
I thought so too.
I think that she can carry a movie by herself just fine, too!
Yes!  The preview really made her look scary, too.
I would not like to get on her bad side!
Do you know that the actress is from Israel?
No, I had thought she was from France.
And, she has two children!
I wonder if her kids will be seeing the movie?
Me too!  Imagine seeing your mom as Wonder Woman on the big screen.
That would have to be really different!
I bet they go to school and tell everybody that their mom is a superhero!
Ha!  Let me know if the movie is any good!
I think that it will be a great, action packed movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch that movie called Magic Mike?
No, who is in that.
It stars Channing Tatum.
Oh ok I think I've heard about it.
It was underrated for sure.
Is that so?
Yes I really enjoyed it.
I thought it might have been more directed towards women given the subject of male dancers.
It was actually great entertainment for any adult.
Why is that?
There is a decent story to it, with great visual effects as well.
Ok that sounds like a good combination.
Yes it is a fun movie too.
Ok that is good.
Yes there are comedic elements, as well as great drama.
Ok I can appreciate that.
Yes I think you will like it.
Ok thank you for telling me about it.
Yes let me know what you like about it.
Ok, it sounds like a unique movie, thanks again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello, I don't think I've seen you around here before.
Yes, I am new here--I just got in yesterday.
How cool! Where from?
Oh, just about everywhere. I'm an army brat, so.
Ah, I see. So've you done anything fun yet?
I got tickets to an Ed Sheeran concert, so that is exciting!
No kidding, I love him!
You do? Me too!
I mean, I figured you did since you got tickets for it.
That is true, that is true.
So how long have you been a fan?
Ever since his first album, +
Is that really what it's called? I know the second one was x.
Yes, and his most recent album is a Divide symbol. They are all math.
That's a curious method.
I don't actually know why he does it like that.
Well, I can't help you there, I mostly know him from his singles.
Which one is your favourite?
I really love Castle on the Hill personally.
That one is great! My favourite is Photograph.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey dude, how are you?
I am great!
I just saw the best movie in the theaters the other night.
Oh yea, what was it?
It was Baywatch.
Oh yeah?  I heard about that.  Who stars in it?
Dwayne Johnson is the main character and Zach Efron is in it as well.
OMG I love Dwayne Johnson.
I do too, he was hysterical in it.
I will have to go see it sometime then.
I recommend that you do, it was a comical movie and was worth the money.
How long was the running time?
It was around 100 minutes long.
That's not bad.  I hate movies that drag on and wastes my time.
Well this movie certainly doesn't do any of that!
Oh yea?
Yea, it is full of laughs and action as well.
Does Zach Efron have a major role in it?
He is one of the main characters as well, so if you like him you will be pleased.
Awesome, thanks for the info!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.  It's been a while.
Yea, what have you been up to?
Not too much.  I just watched 'Star Trek' for the first time.
Which 'Star Trek' movie?
I watched the one by J.J. Abrams.
The reboot?  I really liked that one.
You're a huge Star Trek fan right?  You've seen all the other movies and shows?
I've seen them all.  The first rebooted one was my favorite.
I enjoyed it.  Chris Pine is a fantastic Captain Kirk.
I agree.  He played off of Zachary Quinto's Spock, very well.
They are great together.  The rest of the cast was perfect for their roles too.
John Cho as Sulu is my favorite.  Can't believe he's the same actor from the 'Harold and Kumar' movies.
Do you think I'd enjoy the other two?
I think so.  'Star Trek Into The Darkness' had Benedict Cumberbatch play the villain.
He's one of my favorite actors, so I'm pretty excited now.  How about 'Beyond?"
'Beyond' wasn't as well-balanced as the second one.  But this time, the villain is Idris Elba's character.
He's another actor I really like!  They're doing a great job with casting.
I think the Star Trek universe has so many fans that every element has to be thought out carefully.
Want to watch the other two with me?
Yes I would.  I never get tired of those movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bud! I didn't expect to see you here tonight!
Well, I've been kind of down. I had to get out of the house.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing major, just a lot of fighting at home.
I'm sorry to hear that. What movie are you going to see?
I've really been wanting to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
That's the movie I just came from!
Did you like it?
I loved it! It will surely cheer you up.
I sure hope so.
The character's are so funny! I think I like Rocket the best.
Oh right, that's the raccoon. I like him too.
Did you see the first Guardians?
Yes.
Did you like the soundtrack?
It was pretty good.
Well the soundtrack in the new one is awesome!
I'm really more interested in the action scenes.
Oh you won't be disappointed. Have fun!
Thanks. See you around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how's it going?
I'm doing great how about you?
I'm doing really good. Went to an awesome concert last night!
Oh yeah? Who'd you see?
My favorite band in the world, Duran Duran.
Oh I like them, did they do a lot of their older stuff?
About half new stuff and half older stuff. They really put on a great show!
That's awesome. Who was their opening act?
Do you remember Chic, from the seventies?
Yeah they're pretty groovy!
They put on a fantastic show as well!
Nice! Where did you see them?
They were at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley, it's a nice venue.
Did you have good seats?
Not really, we were in the nosebleed section.
Aww that's too bad.
Yeah but they sounded terrific.
I'm so glad you had a good time.
Me too, I love those guys!
It was nice talking to you. Take care.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched any great movies lately?
I have, I just watched one called Into the Wild.
Is that a new one?
No, it came out a while ago.
Oh, wow, how did you get into that one?
I heard the soundtrack for the movies at a pals house. It blew me away.
The movie or the music?
Both really.
Was the movie that great?
It was a true story, but really had this huge sense of purpose you know.
And the music?
The music was the perfect companion. It really helped you feel as if you were on the adventure.
That is what music should do for movies. Evoke something.
Emotion, elation. Whatever the director wants us to feel.
I think that is why music is important.
I really enjoyed a few films even more, due to their music.
Like?
Nick and Nora's infinite play list.
Is that not just about the music.
No, but the music really makes the movie worth while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Amadeus is such a weird name
It's a period name I'd say
What's that?
like Period clothings, or period dramas. It was Common during a certain time period
Oh I see what you mean.
It means to love God, ama as in love in Latin, and deus for God.
Hm. There was nothing about in the movies I don't think?
No,l but it's an interesting tidbit of fact.
Yes, but did you know Mozarts' sister was also a genius?
A genius? No. A musician, yes. .
She wrote many compositions, but none have survived? That's so sad, Just to be erased fro history like that
It's not a nice feeling, but the movie could've used a bit more info on her if you ask me
Yeah. Mozart wrote to her about her compositions and wasvery impressed by them.
WEll, even if they were not good, i dpoubt he would've written to her criticizing them
She was his older sister after all.
Yep.
Who was that goof who made that song?
The Amadeus song form the 80s?
Yeah.
Um What's his name... Commissar guy. Rock me Amadeus... Falco! That song was so lame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's up?
The sky.
I see it's not raining.
No, nothing but sunshine.
How is it going?
Going good.
What it is?
You.
Wanna have lunch?
Sure do.
Where do you want to go.
Anywhere but here.
How about McDonald's?
I guess that will do.
I really to eat somewhere else.
Let's go to the Golden Coral.
Good choice.
Good food.
It's getting kinda late.
Okay. See ya!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's your day going?
Not too bad. Just grabbing a bite before I have to go back.
Work huh?
Yup.
Sorry to hear it!
Me too!
Did you see that movie on TNT last night.
No. What was on?
V for Vendetta.
That was a pretty wierd flick.
I liked it.
Who was in it?
I don't know most of them, but Hugo Weaving.
Who's that?
The bad guy from the Matrix.
Oh, yeah! He's pretty good.
"Mr. Anderson..."
Ha!
You should give the movie another shot.
I think I will!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how's it going?
I'm good, how about you?
Doing good, so, did you hear about that new Wonder Woman movie?
Yeah, DC movies usually are pretty bad though.
Not this one, it has been getting really good reviews.
Oh yeah? That is surprising.
Hard to believe that it is our first super hero movie that is all about a female.
Yeah, I guess when you put it like that it is.
Anyways, do you have Spotify and listen to any music?
Yeah, I like listening to Throwback Thursday. That's always fun.
Oh yeah, what is that?
They play old music centered around a theme.
That does sound pretty cool, I guess I'll give it a listen.
Are you going to see Wonder Woman in theaters?
Yeah, I think so. I just need to find someone to go with.
Movie tickets are kind of pricey these days, especially iMax ones.
Definitely, maybe it is better for it to just come out for rent.
Well, if you want to go with me then I'll go.
Thanks, yeah. We should go see the movie then.
Alright! Let's see if it meets all the hype!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how ya doing?
Great, just hanging out how about you?
Not too bad I'm thinking of either going to an outdoor concert or going to the movies this weekend.
Oh cool me too. When the weather gets really hot, I'd rather be in the movies though.
Yeah you're right all the cool movies should come out this summer.
I usually hang out with a bunch of friends at the Hillsboro Park. Sometimes they have free concerts along with the farmers market there. Usually Starts in late April til around early August.
Yeah, I have the same thing too in my neck of the woods out in Marylhurst Park. It's also by the lake, so it's really nice.
but this weekend I'm thinking of going to the movies though.
Oh yeah? What kind?
I've watched Pirates of the Caribean yesterday. Will watch Wonder Woman for sure.
Oh yeah hard to keep up with all the sequels. How was it?
Pretty cool actually although it gets a bit boring towards the end of the movie.
Yeah I figured maybe after what, six or seven installments they might be running out of ideas.
True, a trilogy is pretty much the maximum in my opinion.
Unless it's Star Wars....then it's a trilogy of trilogy hahaha.
Haha yeah, not including Rogue One. That's ten movies!
Yeah I can't wait for the final one this December.
Me too!
Oh well, it'll be a fun summer hopefully with all the movies and fun outdoor music concerts.
Yeah it will be, talk to you later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Good morning.
Good morning, how are you doing?
Pretty good, been a busy week.
Me too, I'm ready for the weekend.
I hear that, what are your plans this weekend?
Nothing really, I want to stay home and watch tv.
Sounds like great plans, there's a Indiana Jones marathon on this weekend.
Nice, which channel?
The Starz channel. I might watch it myself.
We can text each other while watching it.
Yeah, like a long distance movie date!
It would be great if there was a Star Wars Marathon too.
Harrison Ford overload would be fun!
Yes, he was such a good actor in his prime.
For sure, I wonder how rich he is?!
Probably loaded, just between those two movie series he had to make a killing.
We should google it.
Ok, I just did and it says net worth of $230 million.
I was expecting more, but that's still quite a bit.
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what are some of the best movies that you have seen this year?
I have a few that were really memorable for me actually.
Well name a few of them.
Logan, Get Out, and Split were all my favorite so far.
Do you have one out of those that was the clear cut winner.
I would have to say Split, the entire movie was excellent.
I thought that was M Night Shyamalan's best movie in a while.
I agree, he completely redeemed himself from his last few movies.
The only problem that I had with the movie were the two girls other than the main one.
What was wrong with them.
I just thought the acting was cheesy, and their characters were rather undeveloped.
I can see your point, the characters really were not that believable.
For sure, I really did not care when they died in the end.
I thought the guy who played the main character was fantastic though.
Yeah he had some of the best acting that i have seen in a long time actually.
I think that he might win an oscar for that performance.
It is a little early to be able to tell, but I think you may be right.
The way he was able to switch between each personality was outstanding.
He is an super underrated actor for sure.
Hopefully this movie will give him more recognition.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what "s going on in your neck of the woods?
Ehh not much ...kind of bored.
Watch some cat videos that will make you laugh.
yeah they are hilarious!
Oh did you see where Wonder Woman came out at the movies?
Really? no I hadn't heard.
Yeah check this out it was directed by a woman. Her name is Patty jJenkins
Wow that is interesting
I'll say! A female super hero and it's been directed by a female.
Oh what a novel idea. A woman director...sarcasm implied!
It seems to be doing well.
Well maybe that might be something I can do tomorrow afternoon
Rotten Tomatoes  gave it 94% thumbs up
Hmm sounding better all the time.
Chris Pine that fine hunk of man is in it.
I liked him as young James Kirk in the Star Trek movie
Oh yeah you know who else is in it? Robin Wright.
I loved her in the Princess Bride!
That is one of my favorite movies!
Yep..agreed. Totally instant Classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how is i going?
Great, and you?
Great. I saw a good movie last night.
Oh yeah, what movie?
Get Out.
I have heard about it. Tell me some more.
It is made by Jordan Peele and is a horror comedy.
Cool. Is it very bloody?
Not terribly. Some, it is a horror movie, but not bad.
Who is in it?
Oh, it has that guy from Black Mirror, the creepy future episode.
Is his name Daniel Kaluuya?
Yeah, that's him. Also has Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford.
I like them.
And everybody's favorite Steven Rooyt has  agreat part.
He is funny and a good actor.
So you think you will see it?
Yeah, probably, is it very long?
Under two hours
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.How are you?
Good.  You?
Fine.  Did you hear the song that just played.
yep.
what did you think?
It was okay. Did you like it
Yeah, it was good.  I like the band
I don't care for them but the song was cool
Do you think you would like to purchase it?
Not sure. Depends onhow the rest of the cd sounds
Yes, sometimes they suck
Haha
Maybe I can download another son and see how it sounds
Let me know what you think
I will.  Do you like any of their other cds
Yeah, I liked the first one
Me too.  It was my favorite
Mine too
Okay well I will let you know what I think
thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any movies over Memorial Day weekend?
I did catch up with that animated movie called Big Hero 6.
I never saw that. Was it any good?
I have to say the world building was impressive. They created this entire futuristic city called San Fransokyo.
Where would you rank it with other similar films?
I would say it was similar to the second How to Train Your Dragon movie. Good visuals but not that great of a plot.
That's interesting. I saw a pretty good movie recently called Logan.
I heard about that. That is the new X-Men movie, right?
That's right. I have to say it's definitely one of the better superhero movies I've seen.
I always have trouble keeping the timelines straight with all those movies.
Luckily with this one it is set in the future and most of the mutants are dead, so you don't have to worry about timelines.
Wow, I'm surprised. It kind of sounds like a downer though.
It definitely was a bit of a downer. Especially seeing the characters get old and sick.
But you still liked it?
Definitely, it was much better than the usual CGI superhero movie where you see a city get destroyed each time.
Cool, I will have to check that out. Is there any new movies you want to see?
I have been hearing lots of good things about the new Wonder Woman movie.
Oh yeah, that looks pretty good. I do like that actor with the square jaw.
You mean Chris Pine? He was good as Captain Kirk in the Star Trek movies.
Yeah, that's the one. We should go see that together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well this was unexpected
What was?
What just happened
You gotta give me more details than that
Well i am watching something
What sort of thing are you watching
I am watching a movie
Well clue me in on it
It is the New Pirates movie
oooh
Yeah the plot took a turn i had not expected
Is that a good thing
Well yeah in this case it is
Why would it not be
Cause sometimes it can be a bad turn of events
Well this one sounds good
Yeah it is pretty awesome turn of events.
Do not spoil it for me
I will not spoil it do not worry
Good you better not
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there how was your weekend?
Hey, yeah it was good, hung out with friends, went to the movies and then dinner...How about you, how was your weekend?
It was good, just hung out with me parent, we had a bit of a road trip, family dinner...it was good..What movie did you guys go see?
Weekend with the parents..Nice..Um yeah we went to see that new Wonder Women movie.
Ooooo..Nice, I heard good things, How was it?
It was good...well, As good as a superhero movie can be but yeah I like it...
What do you mean, as good as a Superhero movie can get?
Well, it's not going to to put you in deep thought or win any awards but for an action movie it was good.
Oh, I see..did it get you that "Girl Power" feeling, how was the actual Wonder Women?
Oh, yeah...Well I didn't go into it with ang fiminist expectations but some of the fighting seems made me proud to be female..the actrist did a really good job portraying Wonder Woman.
Nice, how were the fight scenes, heard they were epic.
Oh, yeah they were good...My favorite was the first fight scene when just Wonder Woman in the war scene, was the first time you get to really see what Wonder Woman has to offer but the first fight scene with the Amazons was also really good..
Oooo, Nice, so looks like I know what I'm going to be doing this Friday.
Yeah, it's worth a watch...I think they did a good job with making Wonder Woman strong but giving her a sense of Naivety, gave her some innocents but they did it in a really good way..
Oh really..does it get to lovy dovy
A bit...of course there's a love interest but its good..they don't just make the guy look like some dumb dube, some weak man that Wonder Woman has to keep saving...they play off each other..
Ok, so no Man bashing?
Yeah, not really...it was interesting..has some funny bits..like when Wonder woman is explaining where she came from and how crazy it actually sounds to just a normal everyday person.
Ok, ok, you sold it..will be seeing it this Friday.
Yeah..again not amazing but still a really good SuperHero movie..Let me know what you think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi how are you doing?
I am doing great and you?
I am doing fine.
Have you seen any good movies lately?
Yes I have. I watched LaLa land and it was so good.
I have heard about that movie. What is it about.
It is the typical musical but it has a great plot
Really what is the plot?
Well it is a musical love story
That is a vague description
Well it is also about people pursuing their dreams in hollywood and the ups and downs of it
So it is basically like rock of ages but set in Hollywood with acting?
Yes the girl is the only one wanting to be a actress.
What about the guy?
He is wanting to be a songwriter/singer.
Ok what else happens?
They get together to break up later.
That is sad
It is but the ending it nice, It shows her coming to see him and she suceeded and so did he.
That is great to hear.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Oh wow! That's only the worst pick-up line I've ever heard.
What's your sign?
Ok. I take back my previous statement. That's the worst.
Sorry, sorry. Seriously though, can I buy you a drink?
What can it hurt. Sure.
What are you having?
I'll have a scotch.
Great. What's your name?
Wouldn't you like to know!!
Ok then. I really wish they would change the music in here.
I know, right. It's horrible.
Country is my least favorite genre.
Mine too.
What do you like?
I like the oldies, like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin.
You don't like any new music? Have you heard of Cage the Elephant?
No I sure haven't. Are they good?
They're great! I'll see if they have any on the jukebox.
Awesome. If not, play some Zeppelin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you plan on doing for winter break this year?
I was thinking about just taking it easy this year. How about you?
I want to take it easy as well. Maybe I'll watch a lot of TV or something.
I love watching Christmas movies.
Me too! I watch Home Alone almost every year.
I love that movie. There are so many good Christmas movies.
Did you ever see that old one that's actually just called "A Christmas Story"?
I love that movie!
Me too. I think it's one of the best ones out there.
Isn't it funny how many different kinds of Christmas movies there are?
What do you mean?
Well, it's like there's different sub-genres of Christmas movies.
Give an example.
Well, we already mentioned two distinct style of Christmas movies. Then there's also movies like Die Hard.
I love that movie. That's another classic.
Then there's also "It's a Wonderful Life"
Ah, yes. I see what you mean.
Jimmy Stewart was great in that movie, by the way.
He was. It's funny when you think about how different that is from more recent Christmas movies.
That's basically my point about all of the different categories, or almost sub-genres, of Christmas movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, friend!
Hey, good to see you! How has your week been?
It's been OK. I've been kind of sick.
Ah, sorry to hear that.
It's OK. I called in to work and just played video games and watched movies all day.
Oh yeah? What movies?
Well, I'm feeling a little too crappy to really focus on anything, so I watched some of my old favorites.
Like what?
I turned on Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. I hadn't watched that one in years.
That's definitely one of my all-time favs as well.
It's amazing how well it holds up. What's it been, 30 years now?
At least that, I'd bet.
I also watched Mad Max: Fury Road. Have you seen that one?
Oh yeah. It's so good.
Maybe my favorite movie that came out last year.
Seems like weird sick day viewing though, don't you think?
I don't know; I kind of just turned it on and let it wash over me.
OK, I can see that. It's a crazy movie but very visually pleasing.
Definitely. Some of my favorite action sequences ever.
That first vehicle chase sequence belongs in a museum.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Since Twin Peaks is being revived, I decided to go back and watch the Twin Peaks movie, Fire Walk with Me.
Oh. I remember that vaguely. When did that come out?
1992. Not a lot of people saw it. Many people hated it because the tone was quite different than the show.
In what way?
Well, it's very dark. It doesn't have as much quirky charm as the show Twin Peaks.
What's it about?
It focuses on the time period immediately before Laura Palmer death. You get to see what her life was like and the issues she was dealing with.
Who stars in it?
David Bowie makes a small, but memorable, appearance. Also Chris Issak, Keifer Sutherland, David Duchovny as a transgendered FBI agent, Harry Dean Stanton, Sheryl Lee, Ray Wise, Grace Zabriskie and more people. It has a big cast.
It sounds interesting. Did it get any awards?
Oh no. Absolutely not. It did not have any mainstream success. It received many poor reviews, but it's one of my favorite movies.
Well, it must be somewhat bad to receive so many bad reviews, right?
Obviously, I don't think so. I think people went in the theater with certain expectations, and when they were not met, they were upset.
So, what kind of issues was Laura dealing with in the movie.
Well, mostly she is coping with abuse.
From her father?
Yes, but in the movie she is uncertain about who is abusing her. This is because of combination of factors. Most certainly one of them is denial.
Do you recommend that I watch it before I watch the new episodes of Twin Peaks?
Yes. If you are fan of Twin Peaks, you should definitely consider this must-see material.
Okay. Well, I consider myself a fan of the Twin Peak world, strange as it may be. I will check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of movies do you like?
I enjoy comedies.
Me too! I love them.
Yes they bring something not too serious into the world that is too negative.
I agree what is your favorite comedy?
I really like anything by Adam Sandler.
He is great and so funny.
Yes I love the movie Happy Gilmore.
That is Hilarious I love the Waterboy.
They are just silly movies that are good for a laugh.
When you think about it all of Sandlers movies are actually really good.
I just recently watched one with him in it where he is a manager for failing stars.
I think I saw that on Netflix.
You should watch it. He does a great job in character.
I will check it out. He reminds me of Caddyshack type movies.
Yes now that is old school.
I think Adam's movies are old school to this generation.
This is true. The comedies now are pretty crude.
The last good comedy I saw was Step Dad.
That was such a funny movie.

What are you up to.
Just gonna do a little shopping.
Boring!
True. How bout you?
Gonna check out that second run theatre.
Oh, cool. What's playing?
They're doing some classics. Tonight is Cassablanca.
Never seen it.
What?!
It's on the "bucket list".
As it should.
What's so great about it?
Bogart?
Fair enough.
Skip the shopping and come with me.
Well, I suppose the shopping can wait.
And it should, you uncultured schmuck!
Easy now!
Ha!
Let's go!

Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you! I'm fine. What's new with you lately?
I saw a really interesting movie last night.
What was it called?
Interstellar. It's the latest Christopher Nolan movie.
I heard that was good, but that it had some absurd science in it.
I really liked it. But yeah, there were some major implausibilities in it.
Like what?
Worst was the "going into a black hole and surviving" thing.
Ugh. I had that. But was it worth it?
I think so. I mean, there's are symbolic ways to interpret the absurd science in this case.
How do you mean?
Like, love was seen as a fundamental force in the universe, like gravity. Scientifically absurd, but beautiful on a symbolic level, and emotionally resonant.
I guess. I have a hard time with movies that have implausibility. Wasn't Matt Damon in that movie? He's one of my favorites.
Yeah, Damon played a minor character. A real jerk, did not behave very well to say the least!
How were the female characters in the movie?
There were some strong, smart women in the movie. Well, mostly the main character's daughter. But she was really good.
I wish there were more good female characters in movies.
Agreed. Pretty rare for a movie to have multiple richly-drawn female characters these days.
Especially science fiction movies!
