Who was the best NFL coach of all time?
I would have to say John Madden.
How come?
He has the highest winning percentage for a regular season.
Not many probably know that.
Yes, he's more famous as an announcer I think.
He also has a Super Bowl Ring.
Not many can say that.
Wouldn't that be awesome to have one of them.
Yeah, I heard someone auctioned off their ring for $200,000.
Wow, that's like winning the lottery.
They carry a lot of value.
It would be rare to have one.
It takes incredible perseverance and hard work to get that far.
Strength as well.
I've never seen a weak football player.
That's for sure.
What do you think the NFL players bench?
Whatever it is would be a lot more than I could ever do or imagine.
They are amazing people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ready for some football?
Yes I cannot wait to see my Vikings, Saints and Seahawks play!
You like three teams, well that is certainly something.
Gives me better odds that one of them wins.
Playing the numbers game right.
It's more of the fact that my favorite players are on those teams, I am not really loyal to a specific team.
So you root more for the players instead of the team.
Yes, I just find it better that way, it gets me more invested in the game, it also gives me more games to watch.
I can't fault you for that.
What about you, who are you rooting for?
I am a true blue Cowboys fan, have been ever since my youth.
America's team huh? They are really back in contention now.
They are, but I am still sad that we could not win one with Romo.
Yeah, he had so much talent, just could not get one for Dallas.
Well now we have a great overall team, I think he could do a lot with the personnel if he was our quarterback still.
I think so too, that team is built to contend.
Anyway we should go to a bar and watch a game sometime this season.
That sounds like fun, I would love too.
Yeah and knowing how many teams you like we will find a game easily.
Well, we'll make sure the Cowboys are also playing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you keep up with NFL football?
I used to, not anymore.
Oh, that's too bad, why not?
Too much drama.
What do you mean?
I mean all the steroids and cheating and stuff.
Oh, but you don't really think they use steroids do you?
Of course they do, have you seen the size of them?
That's not proof though.
Maybe not. But in any case, it's just too violent of a sport.
But that's why people love it. It;s about being tough.
Yea well being tough gives a bunch of guys fatal concussions before the age of 50.
Well, they get paid a lot of money to do it.
Yea, but it's just not something I want to be promoting.
Well I love it, the comradery, the athleticism, the sportsmanship, all of it.
Yea, you're right, there are a lot of good aspects to it too.
Yea, you should give it another chance, it's not going anywhere.
Maybe you're right. Who's your favorite team?
I like the Patriots.
Ok, then. So do I.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would be your prediction for the Bears this year?
16-0, baby! Da Bears!
Very funny.
Honestly, I'm expecting another rough year. Maybe 5-11.
Think John Fox gets fired?
It's a definite possibility.
I think if they aren't at least 7-9, maybe 8-8, he's gone.
I can't really argue that.
The problem I see with the team is that on offense, they don't really have established receivers.
Cam Meredith had a breakout year last year.
He showed he could make some plays, but I don't trust him as a #1 receiver.
Yeah, for all his inconsistencies, you still had Alshon Jeffry last year.
And I just am not buying Kevin White at this point.
Poor guy can't stay on the field.
Yeah, I do feel bad for him, but injuries are a part of the NFL.
True. I think the Bears might actually have a solid defense this year.
Only if they can fix the safety position.
The whole secondary is a little bit unsettled.
'Unsettled' is a nice way to put it.
Haha, it's kinder than 'terrible'!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready to watch the Cincinattie Bengals this year.
Yes cannot wait to see the players. I do not recall them all.
Their quarterback is Andy Dalton.
He is a good quarterback.
Yeah he leads the team well.
i hope he does good this year.
Adam Jones is their cornerback.
his stats are good.
Tyler Eigert is a tight end.
He is good too.
I agree he has improved alot.
I love how he plays.
A.J Green is a wide receiver.
Yeah he helps alot and helps the team score.
I agree he is a great quality to the Bengals.
They do a lot of good with him.
AJ Mcarron is another quarterback.
I have not seeen him play much.
I think Andy Dalton teaches him well.
Cannot wait to see what he does with the bal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Thank you Lord it's almost football season again.
Oh cmon the MLB Allstar game is tonight!
Baseball is too slow, I want action!
How are your Chiefs going to do this year?
I don't know.
What? You always say this is their year.
I know but Alex Smith keeps letting me down, and don't get me started on Reed.
Andy Reed? The coach.
Yeah. He's a horrible time manager.
But put together a great team.
But he chokes at crunch time
Maybe this year will be differant
Maybe monkeys will fly out my butt.
As long as they beat the Raiders.
As long as everybody beats the raiders
You think the rivalry will still be there after the move
Sure.... the raiders will always suck
What are you lookin forward to the most on opening day?
Barbecued lil smokies and beer.
Me too man, me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What teams do you think are going to the Super Bowl this year ?
I think it's going to be the Dolphins and the Seahawks.
I don't think the Dolphins can beat out the Patriots to win their division.
I think this is going to be the year they finally do it.
I really don't want to see the Patriots in the Super Bowl again, so I hope you're right.
I'm sick of seeing the Patriots in the Super Bowl also.
They've been in two of the last three Super Bowls.
They won two of the last three Super Bowls.
They also have been in six Super Bowls since 2004.
Yes, seven if you go back to 2002.
Oh yeah, that's right. I think they won five of those.
Yes, five Super Bowl wins in the last fifteen years.
It is easier to win when you deflate the balls to your advantage.
Yes, that does help a little.
I think I will have to cheer for the Dolphins real hard this year.
There's no chance of anyone else in the AFC East knocking out the Pats.
Who else is in the AFC East besides the Fins and the Pats ?
The Bills and the Jets.
Well you're right about that, no chance for those two teams.
Maybe that's why the Patriots have been to the Super Bowl so many times lately.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the teams moving to different states?
You mean the Rams and Chargers?
Them and and the Raiders.
I think it could be good, Los Angeles has a large population so it should sustain that fan base.
I do not think the Chargers should of moved.
They did have a good base in San Diego however they never won a superbowl
The Rams did in St. Louis but they moved also.
They were in LA previously so I think they wanted to go back for whatever reason
Maybe the Chargers should of moved and Rams should of stayed.
That seems more reasonable but we are past that point now.
What you think of the Raiders going to Las Vegas?
I think it is a good move, they have a large population there to include tourism
Tourists should help make those games packed!
Gambling and Football in the same city, some people are having dreams about it.
How do you think the gambling will effect the NFL?
I think the NFL should take a tax of the winnings of gamblers.
That could be a useful solution, it could help with many things that extra revenue.
Yeah, such as making safer equipment for players
Or investigation how to treat some injuries from the game.
Both are good solution for that gambling tax, I do not think it will happen though. Casinos won't like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the SuperBowl next season?
I don't know yet, there are so many good people who have recently come into the NFL.
I know, like John Ross and Jamal Adams.
Yeah, Jamal Adams is a beast.
He is. I love the Jets but I am a Giants fan.
I don't like either of them; Steelers, baby!
Lame! I hope that the Giants get to the SuperBowl next season.
That would be interesting. I wonder how everything with Odell Beckham JR. will pan out.
Same. I think that everything will be fine.
Who knows. There is a lot more behind the scenes than we know.
What do you think about the return of Marshawn Lynch?
Beast Mode! I think that it will be cool although I do not think that it will be the same.
Have you seen his training footage?
Yeah. He killed it in that beach workout video.
He is so quick. I admire his work and training.
Yeah, he makes it look easy. I think that I'd be able to keep up though.
In your dreams! Even NFL defensive backs couldn't keep up with him.
I'm excited to see what he does with the media this season.
I don't think that he will be too rowdy. He has a good head on his shoulders.
Yeah, he is nice but he takes nothing from no one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the highlights of Superbowl V.
Colts against the Cowboys?
Yes, the first Superbowl after the merger.
Both old NFL teams, although the Colts were shifted over to the AFC.
Correct.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Johnny Unitas and Craig Morton.  Unitas was injured and replaced by Earl Morall.
Morton was competing with Roger Staubach for the job.
Right.
Who scored first?
Dallas, field goal in the first quarter.
Who was leading at the half?
Dallas, 13-6.
Who played at halftime?
Would you believe Anita Bryant?
Wow.
There was no scoring in the third quarter.
How about the fourth?
The Colts tied it and won on a field goal with five seconds left.
Dramatic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for some football next month!?
Next month? I hate the preseason.
Really, why's that? At least it's football.
Yeah, but crappy!
That's true. None of the starters play too long.
But, don't get me wrong... we're getting close.
True. Who you rooting for this year?
I don't know, but I think the Pats are gonna win it all again.
Everyone seems to think that, but I feel like Brady is getting too old.
He's definitely getting up there.
He can say he'll play for however long, but Grandfather Time always win.
But he feels he's in the best shape of his life.
I heard him say that. We'll see.
He's definitely going to be better than Peyton.
Oh, definitely. That was sad to see.
Hopefully Brady goes with some grace.
Yeah. Watching Manning have to be dragged to a ring by his defense... sad.
Tell me about it. And then the HGH scandal...
Oh, yeah. I definitely believed that story.
Me too. But whatever, Brady proved he's better than Manning for sure with this last win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bro what are you watching?
Oh I'm just catching some CFL, waiting for the NFL to come back.
Me too brother, seems like an eternity with all the other sports going on.
You got a favorite team?
Of course man, I'm a Patriots fan!
Oh you're just a bandwagon fan, who doesn't love the Patriots?
Am I really a bandwagon though I've loved them for over 13 years?
I guess not, but why so long?
Firstly they have the greatest quarterback of all time...
That is surely debate bale bro!
Debatable or not, he is amazing and I loved the Panthers matchup in 2004.
Wasn't that the game with the infamous Janet Jackson happening?
Yeah in fact it was, it is why that event was so memorable.
So you love the team because of a Half time show?
Not at all, it just helped me remember the performance and why I've loved the team so long.
I don't want to berate you I just hate bandwagon fans.
I completely get you, everyone in my city is a Warriors fan now.
Of course they are, and when the new West Coast stadium is built, people will flock.
Well I guess it is why we watch the game, we enjoy a battle.
For sure, picking sides can be fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Dan Marino was a good quarterback
Oh for sure, one of the greats.
I only know him from the Ace Ventura movies
He's a better QB than actor.
OJ was a pretty good actor I think
What position did he play?
He was a running back
For what team?
He played for the 49ers and the Bills
I wish the Bills could have a winning season
Yeah, I feel bad for their fans
Detroit came back pretty well from a terrible team to an okay one
Oh for sure.
And the Browns too
Maybe this year will be the year for the Bills
I doubt it.
The Patriots have so much money and power
It's hard for everyone else to compete
The Panthers might have it in them
Let's hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Falcons are definitely making it back to the Super Bowl this year.
Think so? I don't know if they did enough in the offseason.
Dontari Poe and Takkarist McKinley are enough.
You think that's enough to beat the Patriots? They added a lot more.
Brady's not playing a full season. He won't make it past the Falcons week seven.
The Falcons D-line is good, but I don't know, man. Sounds like wishful thinking.
Not at all. They will break Brady, and I will laugh.
Even so, the Pats still have Jimmy Garoppolo. He can ball out, and he's young.
Then they'll break him too. You're not going to reason me out of this.
You can't reason a man out of what he wasn't reasoned into, said, uh, somebody.
Well, yeah. Think the Cowboys will be back?
Yeah, who are they losing? One D-line guy got suspended, I think.
Zeke Elliot might miss some weeks on suspension.
What did he do? I missed that.
I think he beat up his girlfriend.
Lot of that going around! Someone needs to get punished bad.
Yeah, until someone really loses their livelihood, it won't change.
What about the Packers?
I don't think they have enough. Severe O-line issues, and their secondary is suspect.
I think they addressed a lot of that in free agency and the draft. We'll see, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Jay Cutler get a raw deal from the Bears?
No they paid him alot of money
I mean was he as bad as we think he was?
Not at all, I think he got squeezed a bit.
He wasnt bad in Denver.
Or Chicago for that matter.
He did have all the weapons you could need.
Yeah he had a propensity for making dumb decisions quickly.
Who else was terrible in his era?
There were a ton of Cutler types throughout the league.
Like Mark Sanchez?
No Cutler was better than him, Sanchez was good when he had a great defense behind him.
So why hasnt Cutler gotten any calls?
Maybe he has but I think he doesnt want to play anymore.
He did look disinterestd in games.
I think Phillip Rivers got to him back in the Denver days.
I mean yeah he was a crybaby back then.
But he always had receivers to throw to.
Yeah so it makes almost no sense that he wasnt better
Thats what I am trying to say
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football season isn't too far off!
I'm really looking forward to it this year.
What do you think the Steelers will be like.
Well Big Ben is still there throwing to Antonio Brown.
What a great a combination the two of them are.
Brown can run really fast and he has a great TD celebration.
One of the best celebrations for sure.
Not as good as the Icky shuffle though.
That was a great dance.  He is a Bengals legend.
The Bengals seem to be right on the cusp, but haven't broken through yet.
I know they are a hard team to figure out. Dalton is pretty good and A.J. Green is a great wide out.
Their defense is usually pretty tough too.
Speaking of defense I wish there was more in the NFL.
Me too.  I like the close grind it out games.
The Ravens a few years back were really tough on defense.
That was a good defense with Ray Lewis and Ed Reeves.
Ed Reeves just can find a ball anywhere.
He is awesome to watch, such a ball hawk.
He reminds me of Ronnie Lott.
Ronni Lott was a great defensive back for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the NFL cares about the safety of the players.
I think they care, but I don't thinks they will make any significant Changes.
Well they better think about it before they lose all of their best players to injury.
They don't care about the players enough. There will always be more players to fill in when someone gets hurt
Don't you think they are worried that kids will stop playing football?
No.   There will always be football. It is americas favorite sport.
What about the viewers. They might lose viewers.
Never.  People will never stop watching football.
Yeah. You're probably right. With as much as people gamble and play fantasy football, they will always tune in.
While I don't personally like injuries, it is a rough game and injuries happen. Sometimes it adds more excitement to the game.
That's what you say until someone on your favorite team gets hurt.
My favorite quarterback never gets hurt so I am not worried.
Who is your favorite quarterback?
Tom Brady. I am a huge fan of his ever since he played for Michigan in college.
Ugh.  So you're a Patriots fan then? I can't stand patriots fans.
Darn right I cheer for the champions. Did you watch last years Super bowl?
No. I had better things to do than watch the patriots cheat.
You're just mad that your team will never be as good as the patriots.
Maybe so. But my team doesn't deflate balls and spy on the other team.
We are the champions my friend. And we'll keep on fighting till the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Giants chances this year?
Hard to say.  They've got a tough road in front of them.
But they've got such a killer receiving group.
No doubt.  Gonna be hard to try and guard them.
ODB is the best WR in the game.
Top 5 for sure, but hard to say he's the best.
But looks who's backing him up.  There's enough CB's on a team to stop their WR onslaught.
Signing Brandon Marshall will be interesting.
Right, and they've got Shepard who was awesome last year.
I think they lost Victor Cruz, right?
Yeah, he signed elsewhere, but he's done anyway.
What happened to him?
Injuries.  He was robbed of his speed when he blew out his knees.
Tough break for him.
Eli Manning is getting old which won't help.
I think he's 35 or so at this point.
Yeah, and he's slowing down quite a bit.
I bet the defense will help relieve some pressure.
Probably so.  They'll challenge for a wild card spot.
Even the division.  I expect Dallas to fall a bit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe training camp is a month away.
Yeah it'll be great, i can't wait to see college kids compete.
How about Mitch Trubisky?
Who? I never saw none of him...
He started a few games for north carolina last year.
Oh yeah didn't the Bears give away a huge haul for him?
It'll be worth it if he turns into Andrew Luck.
I'm thinking he'll be more of a Ryan Leaf
You really think the Bears are going to be that bad?
What else do they have? Certainly not a functional offense or defense.
At least they are not the Cleveland Browns...
That's true, they were really hard to watch last year.
I really like that they embraced analytics though.
What do you mean?
They have a gm from baseball who is all about getting the most bang for your buck.
Are we supposed to trust the process?
Essentially yes, but this has never been tried in football.
What have they been doing?
Well they compile draft picks and plan on be bad next year.
That's gonna happen anyway.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think football is losing its popularity?
I think it is a little.
I do too.
What do you think the reason is?
I don't know if there is one reason.
I think it's several factors.
I think it's overexposed.
You mean to many games on?
That's exactly what I mean.
I'd have to agree with that.
I think the product gets watered down.
We really don't need a Thursday night game.
I will agree with that.
Some of the Thursday night games are terrible l
They sure are.
I think it's a disadvantage for some teams.
What do you mean?
Some teams only have a few days rest while other teams might be coming off a bye week.
That's a great point.
A lot of rest vs no,rest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you like to go out with me to see da Bears play?
I don't know.
Come on, it'll be fun, Soldier Field is so cool.
Cool like what?
There will be a lot of people, there people will be rooting for da Bears it will be fun. Just think of all the tasty nachos and hotdogs!
I got my kids and I work.
Well they can come along too kids love football.
Yeah, I dunno.
I can tell them about the Bears team.
Okay.
I hope we at least make it to the playoffs this year.
Yes, you would like that, wouldn't you.
Yeah, Bears are the team, we just need a team with the will to win.
Yes, everyone wants to win.
It's like we can't find someone definitive to get our team back to the Superbowl.
Well, yeah not everyone is going to be a Tom Brady at winning.
He only won because he cheats.
Oh, wow okay, never knew that.
It's just frustrating seeing my team lose and not being able to do anything about it.
Yeah, I can't imagine how that feels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite nfl wide quarterback?
Probably Tom Brady.
Yeah, he is probably the best out there right now.
Aron Rodgers is really good too.
Yeah, for sure. He is great too.
I don't really like the Packers though.
Yeah, same, I don't either, they have beat us a few times haha.
Yeah, same lol.
I think the Ravens messed up by paying Joe Flacco so much.
Big time. Since they gave him all that cash the team hasn't been able to keep talent.
Yep, too much for him.
Agreed.
I bet the 49ers are going to be better this year than last.
You think?
Yeah, I bet Shanahan does a nice job there of turning them around.
Could be.
They need one more Super Bowl.
Another would be cool for them.
Maybe in the next couple of years.
Maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the last superbowl?
Of course I did, I bet 20$ on the game
Who did you bet on?
The patriots
Then you must've been very nervous
Without a doubt, I was a wreck
It looked like they were certainly going to lose the game
Yeah especially at half time
Where did you watch the game
At a superbowl party
Were your friends teasing you about your bet?
You bet it, it was quite annoying
But it sounds like you got the last laugh in the end
I laughed so hard when Brady started the comeback
I bet you were yelling and screaming at the TV
I was extremely loud and I was very annoying
What did you do with your prize money?
I just bought some beer for the party
Well that makes you a good winner!
Yes, I didn't want to make anyone mad by winning, so I contributed to the people
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Super Bowl is such a fascinating phenomenom. It's like a holiday but not.
What do you mean? Isn't it a way of life?
There are so many interesting fact about the viewers of the Super Bowl. It would totally blow your mind.
Really like what?
Did you know we Americans eat approximately 1.25 billion chicken wings on Super Bowl weekend?
That is a lot of wings. I can honestly say I've done my part.
Well then you need about 50 million cases of beer on Super Bowl weekend, which is a tab of more than $10.8 billion to wash all that chicken down!
Ahhh beer and chicken wings.....
Yep, I've done my part on that front too. Love the beer. It makes the game better even if my favorite teams aren't playing.
Did you know the average Super Bowl-watching party has at least 17 guests?
That's a good amount of people to feed and water.
Speaking of water...During Super Bowl halftime, there are an estimated 90 million toilet flushes.
Ha! That's from all the beer!
Well it's the equivalent  to 180 million gallons of water flowing at once, or 3.5 minutes of flowing water on the Niagara Falls!
Holy cow! That's a lot toilet flushing!
Well, I didn't even mention the pizza! There is more pizza is sold on Super Bowl Sunday than on any other day of the year!
I would have never thought that, but it makes sense. I've done my share of that too.
Yeah, it's one of my favorites...along with the chicken wings, beer and nachos!
Yeah well that explains why antacid sales increase by 20% the day after the Super Bowl!
I imagine there are quite a few struggling with hang overs too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name the greatest NFL football players of all time?
No.
Why not?  You are the biggest fan of the sport that I know.
The game has changed so much over the years that you cannot name one player as the best of "All time"
Ok. So it's not so easy.  But you can give it a try!
And there are 22 different positional roles, each with a specialized set of skills and experience making them best for that role.  The best quarterback might be the worst defensive end.
Ok. I get your point.
And the position foquarterback is differnt on each team.  While each quarterbacks call plays, hike, hand off, and throw the ball, each team has their own style of play that makes the QB position different on that team.
So, it's a tough task. I get it.
A quarterback playing on a team that throws the ball most of the time is different than a quarterback on a team that runs the ball most of the time.  They need a different body type and skill set to accomodate the offensive strategy.
Alright. I get it.
And the mindset of an offensive lineman is quite different than a defensive lineman.
Yes.
And the left tackle needs different physical features than the free safety!
Ok. I'll never ask you again!
Not to mention that the fullback and tailback are uniquely gifted to fill diferent roles in an offense!
Ok....Ok already!
And some of the best players only played a few years, while other players proved their worth based on steady, reliable, long careers!
I give up. You don't have to tell me who the best player of all time was!
But all things considered, I would say Joe Montana was the best.  Hey, where are you going?
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL is the best sport around!
I agree with you, nothing else really compares in my book.
Who will have the best rookie season this year in your opinion?
That is a tough question!
No doubt about it, it was a really deep draft class this year.
I think Deshaun Watson is going to have a great career.
He could very well be your rookie of the year actually.
Maybe, I watched him tear up a great Alabama defense to win a championship.
He reminds me a lot of Vince Young to be honest with you.
I can see that, but I think he will be a much better NFL quarterback than Young was.
John Ross is another guy I could see having an instant impact.
He is really fast, and he will have a good quarterback throwing to him.
Exactly, and I think with AJ Green lining up next to him, things will be a lot easier early on his career.
That is a really good point. He will get a lot of one on one opportunities.
Leonard Fournette is who I think will end up being rookie of the year.
That is an excellent pick actually. I could see him going over a thousand yards in his first year.
He is just so hard to tackle! He will be great in the passing game as well.
If I had to pick a rookie of the year, I would say either Watson or O.J Howard.
Yea Howard looks like a really good prospect. Did he play at Alabama?
He sure did. I watched him over the years and I really like his game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the greatest QB in NFL history is?
Hands down - Peyton Manning!
Why Peyton?
He owns all the major passing records and he holds the single season TD record.
I'm going to disagree with you on that one, He only won two Super Bowls.
Yeah, that is low compared to others, but you have to look at all the records.
The records are nice, but winning is why they play the games.
Ok, who do you think? Bradshaw, Montana, Staubach?
Come on man! You didn't even mention Tom Brady!
Alright, as far as winning he would be the best.  But he always had great teams because of Belichek.
Your forgetting that Brady won his Super Bowls in the era of free agency.
True, most of the other quarterbacks never had to deal with constant turn over of players.
I think that's what makes Brady so great, he does it every year with different players.
Yeah, I agree.
The greatest pure passer was Marino though.
Yeah, he was awesome to watch.
Imagine the numbers he would have put up in today's game.
True, the rules favor the quarterback today more than in the 80's.
If Marino played today, he may have set records that would never have been touched by anyone.
Yeah, he threw a great ball.  Too bad they couldn't get some players for him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of this year's Miami Dolphins roster?
Their offensive line is stacked in my opinion.
What makes you think that?
Are you kidding?
I didn't see their draft. It must of been good to get this reaction.
Twenty six players on their roster got drafted in the first three rounds of the NFL draft.
Take me through a few players.
Ok lets take their quarterback for instance.
Ryan Tannehill?
Yes, He's the best quarterback they have had since Dan Marino retired.
Well he has shown a consistent level of improvement every year since he was drafted.
Exactly. He is on a very steady upswing and his performance really shows it.
Who else would you say on the roster is a stand out on the team?
I'd say their runing back is another stand out for me.
Jay Ajayi?
Yeah thats him! He established himself as a Top 10 RB in the NFL with three 200+ yard performances.
He was also in a pro bowl if I remember correctly.
Yes he was which just adds on to how good this guy is.
Do you expect them to do well this year?
Absolutely I'd be shocked if they didn't
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, what's up with Kaeparnick?
I don't know man, you think he's gonna get picked up by anyone
I don't think so, I just don't think he's a great player.
Yeah he had a few great years when Harbough was the coach, but has been really bad since then.
I think he just lost his weapons and coach, anybody would be bad after that.
who did he lose?
Well he had Crabtree, he had that Florida State Receiver, Boldin.  Plus Vernon Davis was always hurt.
Yeah that's true, I think we're finding out that Crabtree is pretty good.
Yep.  Where did Vernon Davis end up? I think he left the Niners.
He went to the Redskins.
Ooh they've got a pretty good stable of Tight ends now.
What do you mean.
Well that other really good tight end is still there right? Jordan Reed?
Yeah, but he is always getting hurt. That guy can't stay on the field.
True, but at least they still have Desean Jackson, Kirk has some guys to throw to.
Don't think so man, Jackson took off to go to the Bucs.
Great, we paid Kirk all that money for one year, now they're gonna be terrible, and he's just gonna up and leave next year.
That's certainly a possibility, where do you think he'll go?
I don't know, someone that needs a qb.
Yeah, maybe the Broncos, Texans, maybe the Browns. Somewhere with a decent team that just needs a quarterback.

Do you want to answer some NFL trivia questions to test your knowledge?
Sure man!  I think I know everything there is to know about football.
Ok, who has the most career passing yards?
That's an easy one.  Peyton Manning is the man with 71,940 yards.
Who has thrown the most career interceptions?
Another easy one!  Brett Farve has thrown the most with 336.
Ok here's a harder one.  Who has had the most career fumbles?
That's easy!  Brett Farve again gets that honor with 166.
Ok let's try another one.  Who has thrown the most career interceptions?
That one's a little tougher, but I think it was Paul Krause with 81.
What player has the most career rushing yards?
That would be one of my favorite all time players, Emmett Smith, with 18,355 yards.
Did you know that Emmett Smith also holds the record for the most career rushing touchdowns as well?
Yes, he was an amazing player and athlete.
Who holds the record for the best pass completions?
Another great player, Drew Brees, has that record with 66.6%.
Did you know that Jerry Rice has the record for the most receptions with 1,549?
No, I sure didn't know that one.  That's impressive!
Lastly, which quarterback has the most 4th quarter comebacks?
That would be my man Peyton Manning with 45 4th quarter comebacks.  That man was a beast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best coach in the NFL?
That is easy Bill Belichek.
He does have 5 Super Bowl rings. Hard to argue with that.
He has had a good asset with Tom Brady but his knowledge has a coach has helped lead the team to victory.
That comeback against the Falcons last season was epic.
He goes down as the greatest coach ever for that.
I don't know if anyone else even comes close.
Mike Tomlin is a pretty good coach. If he had a QB that could stay healthy he would have more championships.
Mike Tomlin has a 1-1 Superbowl record.
It would be sweet to have a Superbowl ring.
Another great coach is Sean Payton.
Without Drew Brees Sean Payton would have been gone years ago.
Somewhat agree. Sean Payton is an offensive genius but he needs some help with the defense.
If they can get a strong defense in place the Saints will be contenders.
Pete Carrol is another great coach.
I believe he will lead the Seahawks to another Superbowl.
He did it a couple times already.
He was yards away from having two Superbowl rings.
That is what I love about the NFL. It isn't over until it's over.
That makes for some exciting games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about sports
Okay
Whats your favorite sport?
Football
Thats mine too
Its a great sport
Exactly
And americas pastime
Yes, football is an american tradition
It really is
I love watching it wvery week with my family
Thats great
It is
I really enjoy that part too
Its more fun watching eith other people
Yes it is
Football was made to be social
Exactly
Makes it much more exciting
I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the worst team in the league?
Browns. The Cleveland Browns
The Jets are right up there with them in being awful.
You mean being down there. There is no up with the Browns nor the Jets.
Haha! Ain't that the truth
The Jets have no QB, the browns have no QB.
It is hard to judge which team is worse at this point.
Browns have Osweiler
They only traded for him because the Texans gave them a pick to take his contract.
Yeah that was a dumb move by the Texans to pay him that much.
Osweiler should of stayed with the Broncos. Everyone knew Peyton Manning was leaving.
It was about the money and the Broncos shorted him in offers.
I would of rather took less money then go play for the Texans.
Well he was rewarded by being traded to one of the worst teams, if not the worst.
I can't remember the last time the Browns were good.
I think it was in the 1990's when the Patriots current coach was their head coach.
Didn't the team get sold when he was the Browns coach?
I think so, tough luck because the Ravens who the Browns became have won two superbowls
Yeah tough luck for Browns fans. Not sure how many there really are.
I think I knew one Browns fan, maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Training camp is almost here and I can't wait for the season to start!
Yeah this year's draft was awesome and a lot of teams will be in the hunt for the championship.
I still can't believe Atlanta crumbled in the big game after such a big lead.
Well, you can never count out the Pats and the greatest of all time, Brady.
Whoa there! I dunno if I would call him the greatest. There are way better people to call the greatest.
Like who!?
I will always think of Joe Montana as the greatest. Other QBs like Bradshaw, Steve Young, Elway, and even Manning I would put above Brady.
You are out of your mind! Brady is a proven winner and has the rings to prove it.
I guess we will wait and see. Just my opinion.
Yeah I guess so.
I think the team to watch this year could be the Tennessee Titans, surprisingly
They do have Mariotta who has another year under his belt, and DeMarco who still has a lot left in the tank to do well this year.
Exactly. People seem to forget about them. They just need to shore up their defense a bit and they are a legit contender.
I would agree to that.
But you know who isn't going to do well this year?
Who is that?
The Chicago Bears
Da Bears! Yeah it was a bad showing at the draft, especially the trade to move up.
Yeah I don't get it at all. But I guess they needed to move on and get another quarterback to rely on.
I dunno who is worse at getting QBs....Chicago or the Browns, lol.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won the game?
The Hogs!!
Good, I had a $100 bet on it.
Good for you.
The Hogs are the best.
They have 2 top players on thier team.
I know.
Tim Ryan is back from his hiatus.
You know he's my favorite!
He had a injured knee.
I hope he is healed well.
He's young, so I'm sure he will.
The Hogs are leading the season.
Yep, so far.
I think they'll keep that streak going.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
I hope they don't trade Alfonso.
I haven't heard anything.
Other teams are begging for him.
They can't have him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So it's that time of year again. FOOTBALL!!!!!!
I am ready. How about you?
You don't even have to ask. I called up the other guys. Everybody is coming over to my place this Saturday.
This is the year I win.
HAHAHA yeah right. You know in Fantasy football you don't have to be loyal to your favorite team.
The 49ers are doing it this year.
You are putting too much faith in Shanahan.
No I see a path with Shan and Hoyer.
Well there is always a chance.
All the pieces are there and this is the year they come together.
Like I said anything is possible. But in Fantasy football you should be playing the stats at least to some degree.
I am all in.
Yeah....and how has that worked out for you? I've won the two of the last four years and my favorite team is?
The Rams. Don't know why you like them.
It doesn't matter as far as fantasy football is concerned. And that is why I win and you don't.
But the NIners this year...
Your only chance with the Niners was 2012. Since then there hasn't been anybody on the team that I would pick.
Well that may be but I am a fan. And I will win or lose with them until the end.
HAHAHA that is fine with me. I don't mind taking your money. And you're okay to have around too.
Yeah yeah. I'll see you Saturday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!  Season ticket holder!
Oh yea?  which team?
Bills
Could have guessed
The jersey that I'm wearing?
Exactly.  Dead giveaway
Yea I gotta support my team!
It is a nice jersey
Yup!  I have a signed one back home too!
Yea I have a few signed as well
Bills Jerseys?
Nah, I'm a Seahawks fan
Oh okay.  How do you like the Bills
I cheer for them if my Seahawks aren't playing
Yea I'm kinda the same way towards the Seahawks
Later for now
Good talk
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, what's up with the Bears?
Not sure what you mean.
They may have made the dumbest draft pick ever.
You mean the QB they drafted?
Yeah, Mitch Trubisky.
Why was it a dumb pick?
They traded up for this guy.
Right, so?
They gave up a ton of draft capital for someone who has one season as a starter.
Yeah, but that doesn't make him a bad pick.
But why draft him when you had Mike Glennon?
Glennon's not that good.
Agreed, but Chicago is dumb enough to pay him $15 million a year to sit on the bench.
It was a bit strange, but you need a good backup QB.
Either way, no matter who starts, that old saying about quarterbacks is how I think of them.
What old saying?
"If you've got two quarterbacks, you've got none."
That's a weird saying.
Basically means that you don't have a franchise QB if you can't decide on who's better.
Than you trade one of them for a bevy of draft picks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your all time favorite MVP winner?
Oh, definitely Jim brown.
Who is that?
Are you kidding? Jim Brown player for the Cleveland Browns back in the 1950.
Oh jeez, that's way too old.
You said all time.
I know, but I didn't think you'd go ancient on me.
Ok, fine, who is your all time favorite?
Joe Montana.
Yea he is one of the great ones.
Yep, he won two years in a row, 1989 and 1990.
For what team?
The San Francisco 49ers of course.
Oh yea that's right.
It was a close race between him and Brett Favre for my all time favorites.
For me, it was between Jim Brown and Peyton Manning.
Peyton Manning is definitely one of the greats as well.
Yea, I think he bought some Papa Johns restaurants after he retired.
Oh, no wonder their pizza tastes so good.
Yea, that guy dominates at everything he does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL season's coming up. I sure hope my team does well.
You're not still a Ram's fan; are you?
What else would I be? They just had a bad season.
I'll say it was a bad season. Coach Fisher got axed and the owner put the rest of the team on notice.
The team's a brand. It's worth almost $1.5 billion.
The revised estimate values them at $2.9 billion.
That's one of the reasons why they're my favorite team.
Keep in mind though that they lost to the 49ers 28-0. And that was a horrible season for the 49ers.
Maybe with Coach Fassel they'll do better this season.
Actually, Sean McVay is their new coach. I thought you said that this was your team.
I hadn't heard about that.
It was announced the day that the Chargers moved to Los Angeles.
I didn't know that the Chargers were an LA team now.
They're part of the Western Conference now. It's time for the Rams to shape up, or ship out as the saying goes.
The Rams have a long LA history, though.
The San Diego Chargers do too. They were the Los Angeles Chargers before moving to San Diego.
Yeah, and the Rams were the Cleveland Rams back in the day.
How do you think they're going to make a comeback this upcoming season?
Well, they've got good players -- Jared Goff, Malcolm Brown, Tavon Austin.
We'll see if that makes a difference this time around.....
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does training camp start for the NFL?
In two weeks, I think.
Cool. I can't wait for the start of the season.
Who are you pulling for this year?
I am liking the Panthers.
Carolina? Did they have a good draft?
I think they did okay, but they had some key players hurt last year, which cost them.
Yeah, they went from the Super Bowl to the toilet bowl last year.
Come on, it wasn't there fault. Like I said, they had some injuries to key people.
I guess we will see.
Who are you picking this year.
The Patriots to repeat.
That's not very original, everyone is picking New England.
My pick doesn't have to be "original"...maybe "everyone" knows what they are talking about?
Okay, fair enough. Let see if they stay healthy all year.
Yeah, but every team has that concern.
Did the Patriots pick up anyone good in the draft.
Tough to say. They lost some key picks due to "Deflategate"
Oh yeah. I remember now.
I guess we will see if their picks lower in the draft order pan out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about them Cowboys?
What about them?
Do you think they'll be any good this year?
Well, they have Elliott..
So that's good?
Yea he's a great player.
I miss the old Cowboys team
Oh, me too.
Emmitt Smith
Number 22 - the best!
Troy Aikman
At least he's still announcing!
The 90's Cowboys were so great.
How do you feel about Romo.
Eh. He had some good days, some bad days.
I agree.
I just wish we'd get into the Superbowl this year
That'd be the dream!
Imagine if it was the Cowboys vs the Patriots?
America's most love to hate teams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo
Hey
I am running late
You still coming to bdubs?
Yeah
Just making sure
Yeah I wouldn't miss it
You better not
First game of the NFL season no way
Yeah it's gonna be interesting two super bowl champs playing each other
It's gonna be amazing
A legendary game for sure
Easily
I'm excited
Better be
Are you
What do you think
No?
Yes you dolt
I know I'm joshing you
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like the last Superbowl?
Not crazy about it as I am not a Patriot fan.
You have to admit it was exciting right?
Absolutely but, the wrong team won.
Why do you say that?
Brady is a cry baby and Belecheck is a cheater.
What two teams do you think are the best franchises in the NFL?
I would say Green Bay and Pittsburg.
Why do you pick so two?
They have been around for many, many years and are steeped in tradition.
Which one of the two is your favorite?
Green Bay.
Why did you pick Green Bay?
I am from Wisconsin and have been following them for many, many years.
How do you think they will do this year?
If Rodgers stays healthy, I would guess 12-4 and a deep run in the playoffs.
Who is the most famous Green Bay Packer.
I would say Bart Starr.
Why Bart Starr?
Because of the touchdown he scored in the "ice bowl" to beat Dallas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know how at the end of each Super Bowl the MVP looks at the camera and says "I'm going to Disneyland," or "I'm going to Disney World?"
I'm very familiar with that.
Do you know how that got stated?
It got started back in 1987 when Michael Eisner was the CEO of Disney.
So he started it?
Actually, his wife came up with the idea.
How was that?
They were out to dinner with friends and one of the friends was asked what they were going to do next and they answered by saying, "I'm going to Disneyland."
So his wife thought it would be a good slogan?
Exactly.
Do the players really get to go?
They do and they even get to rid in a parade.
That would be so exciting to ride in a Disney parade. Who was the first person to say this?
Phil Simms. He was the quarterback for the New York Giants.
Did he say Disneyland or Disney World.
He said Disney World.
What a fun thing to get to do once the season is over.
I would love a trip to Disney World
I guess all we have to do is become professional football players and win the Super Bowl.
Oh is that all?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will you be following the NFL football games this year?
Yes absolutely. I love pro football.
Which one is your favorite team?
I've been following the San Francisco 49ers for a while now.
They've historically been a strong team, but not lately.
They did win five Super Bowl championships way back you know.
When was that?
In the eighties, on through the mid-nineties. Kind of a golden age.
Their coach Bill Walsh did good by them.  He made one particular game play popular.
Offense or defense? He was a great coach.
On offense. It was called the West Coast offense.
That was a good development.  Passing instead of running was good for football.
Weren't there a lot of Hall of Famers on the 49ers?
That's true. Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young.
Those guys were great. How is the team now?
They moved their home, so they're headquartered elsewhere.
Okay, what else?
They hired a couple of coaches to replace Jim Harbaugh.
How are they playing?
Right now they need to find some legs to stand on. They're ranked really low.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe it's time for preseason football in a couple of weeks?
I know...where does the time go?
Have you been watching the Philadelphia Eagles practicing? What do you think?
I am excited about the team.
What makes you say that?
I like their new young quarterback. I think he may just put a fire undef the team.
Yeah, but what do you think of the coaching?
Well, that may be a problem. I am not sure about the offensive coordinator.
Yeah, me too.
What did you think of their draft choices?
I thought they were pretty good, but time will tell.
I sure hope they do better this year. Last year was disappointing.
Me too. Do you think you will get to any games?
I sure hope so. I would like to see them play the Dallas Cowboys.
Me too. Let's try to get tickets for that.
We will have to get them early, They sell out quickly.
Let's spend a little more and get some really good seats.
I agree. But I think they play them in December,it will be cold.
That's ok, we will bundle up..
And we will do a lot of yelling and jumping up and down so it will be ok...cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do think the Steelers will do this year?
Pretty much the same as last year.
So you think they'll make the playoffs.
Of course. Their offense is still one of the best in the NFL.
Do you think they'll make it to the Super Bowl?
Probably not. New England is still in the AFC and they are well, good and lucky.
Yeah, they really have a difficult time with New England.
Don't remind me.
Do you think their defense has gotten any better.
For sure. Their secondary is still young and getting better all the time.
I thought they improved a lot last year. I agree.
They still have a long way to go on defense, but I'm happy with the progress.
Do you think New England wins the AFC again.
Of course. Unless Tom Brady decides to retire mid season.
He's almost 40. He isn't slowing down any time soon.
Unfortunately. We will still hear from Tom Brady for at least 2 to 3 more seasons.
Peyton Manning deteriorated when he got close to 40. Wonder why Brady hasn't.
Probably because he releases the ball so quickly and never gets hit.
That's true. He never gets hit.
Last time he got injured, they made a special rule about not hitting below the knees. He's too protected of a player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Super Bowl last year?
Yeah, I watch it every year.
What did you think about it?
I think it's definitely the best comeback I've ever seen in a Super Bowl, and maybe in any football game.
It was really crazy wasn't it?
Yeah, I still can't believe it happened.
The Falcons will never get over that. They completely fell apart.
I bet a lot of people stopped watching the game around the 3rd quarter.
I thought about it. I kept watching mainly to see the commercials.
It's a good thing you stuck around!
I know! I'm so glad I got to see the whole game.
Do you think that game solidified Tom Brady as the best quarterback ever?
Yes I do. He was already amazing, but that game put him over the top.
So who is on your Mount Rushmore of quarterbacks?
I would have Brady, Montana, Elway, and Bradshaw.
Bradshaw is an interesting choice. You don't hear him being mentioned all that often.
People forget how good he was. I think it might be because he's a goofy TV personality now.
I would have Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, and Steve Young.
It's a shame that Marino never won a Super Bowl.
Yeah, I know. But I don't hold that against him. He's still one of the best ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you think the Raiders will take another step forward this year?
Not sure, I think Derek Carr may be overrated.
Hmm, that could be true but I hope they do.
Me too, give Oakland something to celebrate.
What about other sleeper teams you think can take a leap forward?
I like the Buccaneers to move forward in a weak division.
True, it's time for Winston to take the next step in his career.
Exactly, he has shown promise.
Who do you think wins the AFC South?
I like the Titans if Mariota stays healthy.
True, but they can't seem to catch a break.
That's accurate and the Texans are always pretty decent.
Yeah, but I think JJ Watt is getting old and overrated.
Nah, he was injured last year, he deserves another look.
Yeah, but it's amazing how quickly players regress anymore.
Players have gotten bigger and faster, injuries are inevitable.
Very true, I think 30 is now considered old for the NFL.
It's so crazy how that used to be considered prime age for the NFL.
The game has changed so much in a few years.
That is definitely true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't wait for the upcoming NFL season.
I can't either. It will be here before you know it.
What are some memorable games from last season that really stand out for you?
Well, the Super Bowl certainly stands out for me.
It stands out in NFL history, that's for sure.
The Steelers Ravens game on Christmas really stands out.
That was a great game. Steelers looked down and out and Antonio Brown made that memorable play near the end zone.
He stretched out and clinched a playoff spot by inches. He doesn't get in there, game over, season over.
That Chiefs Broncos game really stands out for me.
The one on Thanksgiving night?
Yes, that one. It went back and forth and the Chiefs won in overtime.
Didn't that have some crazy thing happen at the end of that game?
I believe that's when the field goal banked in off the goal post.
I do remember something like that. Speaking of goal posts, remember the Arizona Seattle Sunday night game?
I wish I didn't remember.
Me either. But that was a strange game.
It ended in a tie, correct?
I believe it did. Something like 6-6 or 9-9.
There was some bad field goal kicking in that game.
Certainly was. I don't think there will be a game like that for a long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best team in the NFC?
Right now I would say Dallas
Not Atlanta?
i think they have a bad year, watch Ryan get hurt
Ouch no Seattle love either?
Yeah Seatlle might that team
Does their defense hold up?
Absolutely, I think itll be even better.
After Seattle who else could be it?
I think thats really it.
You never mentioned Green Bay
I dont think thy will be good this year.
Wow Aaron Rodgers is still there ya know
I understand that but hes getting older.
Any dark horses you can think of
Possibly Philadelphia
Wow thats bold, I Dont think they are that good yet
No they arent but they have potentioal.
And I guess New Englad is the best in the AFC
Without saying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the biggest letdown this season?
I'm thinking the Atlanta Falcons as they had a great season last year, but I think this one will be different.
Why do you say that?
Well, they had several balls just bounce their way last year and I just think that they won't be so lucky this year.
I understand as they also lost they also lost their offensive coordinator during the off-season.
Yep, so they will have a different play scheme since the new offensive coordinator is more conservative.
So he's going to want to run the ball more and not pass as often?
From what his record shows, yes, he will be more into the running game.
That could definitely change things, no doubt.
Who are you thinking?
I'm thinking Dallas will have a letdown season.
What? Are you kidding?
Nope, not at all.
With Prescott at quarterback and Elliott in the backfield? No way!!!
They're great players but the offensive line has changed as several linemen left for other teams.
So you see that making a big difference?
Yes, as if the offensive line doesn't block for Prescott and Elliott, they won't be able to run the ball and Prescott will be pressured a lot.
I see your point as if they don't have room to run through, its tough to gain much yardage.
That's what I'm thinking.
Well, we'll see once the season starts and find out which of us is right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
It's fun to watch!
Yea I'm a die hard fan!
Me too!
Do you like to watch from home?
Nah I go to the bar
I see
Yea I got so mad last week
Oh?
Yea I smashed my beer bottle on the bar
How did that turn out?
Quite badly!
How so?
They kicked me out!
That sucks!
Yea I was so mad!
Funny story man!
Talk to you later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
People like system analysts, chemists score 32 and 31 respectively.
So Davis' score is pretty good. He's a pretty smart guy.
Yes, but that's good and bad, the only person who got the perfect score, McInally, wasn't drafted until the fifth round
That's weird
Well, NFL doesn't like either extremes. Can';t be too dumb, can't be too smart.
A lot of the QBs are in the high 30s to low 40s though.
Yep, Think the highest amongst the QBs is Ryan Fitzpatrick with 48 which 2 points below perfect score.
Why do the NFL use it anyway? What does it even test?
Oh, it's a basic IQ test. 50 questions meant to be answered in 12 minutes.
Why such a short time?
It was just designed that way.
Weird.
Not so weird if it's consistent at rankign the individuals on certain traits liek reasoning, rationality, learnign ability etc.
How is that even relevant to football?
it's relevant to ALL occupations. FGootball invoves learning, reasoning like all other occupations
You just run with the ball, it's not that hard.
Well, actually it IS hard. There is alot of split rational deiciosn you havbe tomake in terms of which way to run, how to cut, when to cut
Huh. I would've never thought of football as a decision making process.
Well you do now.
Guess you live and learn.

Hi
Hey
Whatcha up to
Just at the store
The store?
Yeah
Why
Because tonight's the big night
What night?
It's the super bowl
Oh man
What
I completely forgot
It's cool
You got plans?
Yeah going to a party
What sort of party
Beer and bratwurst
Sounds yummy
It will be
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just think that Seattle has enough to still be great.
Yea, well they do if they can stay healthy.
Well, that is the case for every team. Health is always a major factor.
Yea, it is and it becomes more of one as players get older.
Yea, I agree. The Seahawks do have players that have been around a while, but they haven't had too many injuries
I agree, but they play hard and as they get older, I'm not sure what will happen.
Yea, well if they can't make noise this year, plenty of other teams will.
Well, if you're looking for good quarterback play, maybe the Packers have some magic in them.
Yea, I thought they were slowing down last year until they turned it on late in the year.
Yea, they sure did. Its like Rodgers just flipped a switch.
Yea, Rodgers can take it to another level and for that, you cannot count out the Packers.
Yea, I wouldn't count out Dallas either. They had a good team last year.
Yea, well that offensive line is fierce and they have a couple playmakers.
Yea, I agree. I'm just not sure whether or not they can take the next step.
Yea, young quarterbacks these days have what it takes to win early.
Yea, that puts the pressure on their young quarterback.
It does, but I think he may be able to handle it.
Yea, especially with the help of Ezeqquial Elliott.
Yea, it should be a wide open race in the NFC.
Yea, lots of teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What NFL rookie are you most excited about seeing play?
I think I am most excited to see what happens with Mitch Trubisky in Chicago.
Oh so you are interested in if he will be a boom or bust?
Yeah, with everything Chicago gave up to get him, I am interested to see how he performs.
Do you think he is going to start for the Bears this year?
I think it all depends on how he does at training camp and in the pre-season. I know they have Glennon, so they might not be planning on starting him.
Didn't the Bears also sign Sanchez, too?
Yeah, they picked him up earlier this year, but he was injured turning an offseason workout, so Trubisky might have to be ready to play.
There usually aren't that many quarterbacks in the NFL that find success their first year.
Dak Prescott was extrememly lucky last year to be in such a great situation.
He had the leading rusher to really take the pressure off his throwing the ball, but with what he did do, it seemed fairly accurate.
I think that Dak's situation is unique in today's NFL because he was able to take some time as they leaned heavily into their run game.
That's very true, I just think that it's tough to be a first year quarterback in the NFL, no matter your talent level.
Yes and that's why Mitch will be fun to watch because he did not play very long in college before being drafted by the Bears.
It will be interesting to see if he is an upgrade from Cutler, since he left to join the broadcast booth.
Cutler was a talented quarterback at one time, but it's almost like he stopped liking to play when the team wasn't adding stars.
At least the Bears have a better running game than they have the last few years.
Howard will likely be able to help Mitch or Mike Glennon get comfortable in the offense before having to throw too much.
That will be great for them, but I hope they aren't counting on a Zeke Elliot situation, because Howard is not him.
No, but he will be a great serviceable running back as they try to improve their record this year.

Football seasons is almost here.
I know my husband is already talking about it.
So is mine. He is already arguing about how great the Patriots will be this season.
Oh please they are nothing but a bunch of cheaters.
Everytime i remind him of that he says it was just a misunderstanding.
Nothing like making excuses for a dirty team.
I know you agree with me that the Steelers are so much better then the Patriots.
I grew up in Pittsburgh so definatly they are the best team.
I really hate when they play the Ravens
I just dont like the Ravens i think they just display poor sportsmenship
I agree plus theyre fans do not help with the way they act
yes they are terrible wether they win or lose.
So are you guys gonna try to make it to any games this year.
I really want to see the Steelers play a home game
I am pretty sure theyre first game is a home game in September.
Yes they play the Cleveland Browns at home.
Maybe you should go to that one it is a sure win for the Steelers.
I dont know they have lost to them a few times.
I dont know if my husband wants to go to a preseason game
Remind him how much cheaper they are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe the Falcons blew such a demanding lead.
That is true, but what can you expect from some birds.
I wasn't expecting THAT, that's for sure.
Then what was it?
Something else.
In the NFL?
Isn't that what we are talking about?
I think so.
What team will you be rooting for next season?
A better question would be what team would I not be rooting for.
What team would you not be rooting for?
The Falcons!
Well, I am going to be rooting for them!
Is that so?
No, can't afford another heartbreak.
That's what you said after your second marriage...
Hey!
I'm going to be rooting for TB12.
Can't go wrong with that.
Unless, you know...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you looked at the NFL schedule this year for the Panthers?
Yeah I think they'll do  better than last year.
Hopefully, because the schedule is a little easier than usual.
Yeah I think Cam Newton will have a good year.
Me too, but I think the Patriots are still the team to beat.
Oh definitely, it seems like that every year.
But there's always some surprise team that comes out of nowhere.
Yeah I wonder who that will be.
I doubt it's anyone in the NFC South.  I think the Packers could make some noise.
yeah the Falcons blew it last year. It could be Packers and Patriots.
I hope it's two new teams this year in it.
Do you think McCaffrey will start and play well?
yeah he looks like the complete package and could complement Cam Newton well.
Yea he could be dangerous.  Who else could be good?
I think we need Kelvin Benjamin to lose some weight.
Oh yeah for sure, I don't know how he gained so much weight.
I hope he's mentally into it.
yeah he is the difference maker.  Are you going to any games this year?
I am going to the first home game, maybe you could join me.
Sure I'd love that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the 49ers this year?
They might be better or not.  You really can't tell.
Well, they made one move that they should have done years ago.
Yeah, the offensive line has been horrible.
They finally made a move to plug all the holes.
Kap was running for his life the last couple of years.  Them not fixing the line was a clear message.
The niners have been on cruise control for a few years now.
They made a change at head coach again.  Wonder if this one will stick?
They really screwed up when they got rid of Harbaugh.
Well, they got a new coach again and it will be interesting.
It is not like he has to do anything special.  He just has to be better than last year, which is not saying much.
They have totally changed over the roster.
The free agent moves and the draft seems like an upgrade from the past teams.
Yeah, some of the problems were clear.
It is a brand new year, but niner fans are not going to get their hopes up.
Yep.  It has been a downward decline ever since Coach Harbaugh left.
The new quarterbacks are just a bunch of place holders.
With the Shanahan offense, they might not need to be that good.
Well, they don't have to be great. The expectations are going to be low.
Some niner fans are going to believe the hype out of the gate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how about those Miami running backs?
Obviously the conversation there starts with Jay Ajayi.
Yes, quite a year he had last year.
It was, he really burst onto the scene when he got a chance.
But it wasn't all good for him, was it?
No, he had three games over 200 yards, but only one other game over 100 yards.
And he did not catch the ball well at all.
True, he only had 27 receptions on the season, and he had 10 of those in two games.
So he has some things to work on.
The key here is that he is working on them.  Reports out of camp are that he is working hard and is now a better receiver.
What about the other backs on the team?
Well, basically they have two other experienced backs and some guys who are long shots.
Damien Williams and Kenyon Drake?
Yes, those two are pretty well known quantities.
Damien Williams flirted with the Patriots.
True, but he was never really going anywhere.  He is too valuable as a receiver and special teamer.
And Kenyon Drake?
He has home-run hitter all over him.  He can make game breaking plays, they just need to make sure they are positive plays.
Anyone of note in the other guys?
Probably not, but they have training camp to show what they can do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited about the upcoming NFL season, are you?
Yes, pre-season starts in August!
The NFL season can't start soon enough for me!
I bet, since you got that super huge new TV to watch it on.
Yup, the Titans are going to look even better on it.
the Tennessee  Titans have had a few good years since getting that new quarterback.
Yes, Marcus Mariota was drafted back in 2015 and he is a good young quarterback.
Where was Marcus from?
Mariota played college ball with Oregon and had a great career there.
How did the Titans do with Marcus at the helm?
The Titans had a winning season with Marcus last year.
You think he will do even better this year and take them to the super bowl?
Hard to say how Marcus will do, he had a leg injury  at the end of last season.
Most quarterbacks in the NFL recover from leg injuries I think.
Your right, it is the shoulder and neck injuriest they have a hard time recovering from.
Is Marcus going to start this season for the Titans?
It looks like Marcus will be starting this season for the Titans
He has fully recovered from his leg injury then I would assume.
According to the latest news, Marcus has been cleared for full team drills so I think so.
I can't wiat for another exciting year of NFL football!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bro, if you had to take one quarterback this year, who would it be?
Oh man that's a tough question, it's gotta be either Rodgers or Brady.
You gotta pick one to take you to the Super Bowl.
I'll go with Brady, he's probably the best quarterback to ever play the game.
I would argue that he isn't, I think he just got with a great coach at a perfect time.
The guy has won 5 super bowls and owns so many records. You're crazy if you don't think he's the best
I think the best way to look at it is when he was hurt that one season.
When he tore his ACL?
Yeah, he gets hurt, and Matt Cassel comes in.
You mean the Cassel that was terrible in Kansas City?
Yes indeed. The same Matt Cassel that has now played terribly on 5 more NFL teams.
So what's your point?
Matt Cassel came in and led the Patriots to an 11-5 record.  And put up some great stats doing it.
Yeah I remember that, I think they franshise tagged him after that year.
Right, he was awesome for the Patriots, got a big contract playing somewhere else, then was terrible.
So what does that have to do with Brady not being the best ever.
I think it's pretty clear that Belichek is the great one here, and can win with anyone under center.
He's done it for so long though.
All I'm saying is, there's better quarterbacks out there, like Rodgers, who havent had the advantage of having the best coach of all time.
Agree to disagree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember who won the Super Bowl after the 1972 Dolphins?
Yes, the Dolphins.
Oh, so they won back-to-back?
Yes, that is correct.
Who did they beat in their second Super Bowl?
The Minnesota Vikings
Oh the Vikings. I don't think they've won a Super Bowl before
That's right. Been a bunch of times, but never won one.
Like the Bills.
Kind of, but the Bills went four times in a row and lost each time.
Yeah, that was brutal.
Do you remember the Vikings QB back then?
No
Fran Tarkenton.
Oh yeah, he's beloved up there.
And in Georgia. He's a Bulldog
Yeah, the great #10.
Yes, that's him.
Well the Dolphins were probably the dominant team back then
Yes, that is correct.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a football fan?
Yes, but I worry about the long term health consequences of football.
But you're not playing, just watching!
I know, but I feel somewhat uncomfortable about supporting the sport.
What sort of health consequences?
Doctors and scientists have suggested that repeated small head injuries can be detrimental to players, leading to painful mental and physical symptoms.
Oh, that's terrible.
It's called chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
How do you know about this?
It's been in the news a lot recently. There was also a Hollywood dramatization of some of the early findings.
Wow, I had heard rumblings but had no idea it was so serious.
Yes, it is. Though I still follow the sport.
It's hard not to!
It is. And there are so few things that don't involve someone getting hurt or exploited at some level.
Sad but true. At least players are usually well compensated at the NFL level.
Though they also have relatively little freedom to move about as they please.
That's true. Sometimes teams seem to think they own the players.
It begins in college-- players are workers and deserve to be compensated as such.
Well, I agree with that. It's like a waiting game-- if you make it out of college the NFL will reward you if you are good enough.
And hopefully your health won't be sacrificed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you read about the draft grade that the Chicago Bears got?
Yes, they had a horrible draft!
That front office is the worst in all of football.
They have to be. That trade from the third position up to the second position was just bizarre.
On ESPN, everyone says that San Francisco "fleeced" the Bears' front office.
Wow, that is strong language, but they're right.
I was watching the draft live at home, and i was stunned when they announced that the Bears were moving up.
Me too! I thought all along that they would take a defensive lineman or move down and take the safety from LSU.
Right. Every projection had them taking a "can't miss" lineman at number three or even a strong safety.
But instead they trade up one spot to take a quarterback!
I just don't get it. Trubisky is just the best of a terrible class of quarterbacks this year.
I agree. He only played one year at North Carolina on top of it all.
I wouldn't mind the pick as much if the Bears hadn't just signed Mike Glennon to a huge contract to the quarterback for 2017.
Why would they sign Glennon and then draft a quarterback when they have so many other needs on that team?
It makes no sense. That front office is pathetic.
They are awful. And don't even get me started with the Bears drafting a Division II tight end in the second round.
I was still in shock when I saw their second pick, and I just threw my hands up in disgust.
Me too. The Bears will be the worst team in the NFL this year.
Well at least they'll have another high draft pick next year.
That doesn't matter if the front office has no idea how to run a proper draft room!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Yeah, NFL, not college, so much.
Same here! What's your team?
Seahawks, you?
Your rival, Cardinals.
Haha, we beat you every time!
Hopefully not this season...although we are in need of some new players.
We still got Wilson!
He's okay, I guess...
Better than Palmer!
Palmer is getting a bit old, but I think he can still play and so can Fitz!
Yeah better than the Browns!
Anyone is better than the Browns! Man, they were bad last season.
I think they won one game?
Pretty embarrassing! I feel sorry for them.
All I want is for Patriots to not to win!
Yup, and the cheeseheads!
And the Steelers!
I know I can't stand them either!
Well, either the Seahawks or the Cards will have to beat them then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Week 1.... Bucs VS Bengals.
Yes, looks like the Bucs have to hustle right out of the gate.
Hopefully not to much.
How so?
Well, last season the Bucs were 9 and 7 and the Giants were 11 and 5
True.
They got three games pre-season to get warmed up.
Who do they have to play?
The Dolphins first. They were 10 and 6 last season.
Ouch, slightly better.
Yes, and if they defeat Miami then they face the Bears. they were 3 and 13.
Man, that's Jacksonville stats.
Indeed. After the bears they face the Vikings. They were 8 and 8 last season.
Hmm.... so that a good workout.
Yes, they should be ready for the Giants in October.
My fingers are crossed.
Any black out games this year?
For the Bucs or in general?
For the bucs.
No. We may not get to see all of the Miami games tho. Jacksonville is always rare here in Tampa.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Bill Belichick will retire when Brady does?
It's hard to say. I'm sure Belichick has a ton of respect for Brady, but he is really a next man up kind of guy.
I know that's what he says but he and Brady have been together for years now. Don't you think it's a little different with him?
I would assume so, but you never know with Bill. He's very much a business, not personal, kind of guy.
I know, but with the success they've had together I think it'd be hard to have one without the other going forward.
It would be strange for sure, but I could see him continuing.
Well, then that brings up the question, how much longer do you think Brady has?
I don't know but I can't see him being a Brett Favre. He has too much respect for the game.
What do you mean?
Well, Brett Favre was an amazing quarterback, but he decided to come back and he just wasn't in his prime.
Oh I see. Yeah, I can't see Brady playing if he's not 100%.
Me neither. But as long as he feels good and is playing well, who knows how long he will go!
How old is the oldest quarterback to play?
I think there were a handful to play at 44, almost 45, but not many.
And how old is Brady?
He will be 40 in August, so he'd have to hold out for a few more years to beat that record.
Do you think he will try?
I honestly don't think he cares about being the oldest, I think he just still really likes the game.
The key will be not getting hurt.
Yes. At that age, knees can be a major issue.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you into football at all?
Yeah, I watch it some.
Do you watch pro or college most times?
I'm a NFL fan. Don't watch much college. What about you?
I'm an NFL fan too.  Can't wait for the season to start.
Me either.  Who's your favorite team?
I'm a cowboy fan from way back in the day.  What about you?
Bronco's.  Been one since Elway started for them.
So you were there for their back to back wins?
Best times of my life.  I still get chills watching him dive for the TD in his last superbowl.
Yeah he definetly went out on top.  But he really had Tarell Davis to thank for their being there both those years.
That's for sure and probably would have been a third year if he didn't get hurt.
That's something Denver has always had, a strong running game.
Always seems they can churn quality backs out of there no matter when they were drafted.
Or if they were drafted.  Of course can't talk about Dallas and Denver and not mention the Cowboy win in '78
Well, can't win them all I guess.
That was the start of four superbowl losses for your team.
But they came back with a couple wins.  Your team lost some superbowls too you know.
True, true.  I'd just like to see Dallas in another superbowl again.  It's been a long dry spell now.
Not so much for the Bronco's I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any NFL predictions?
What do you want to know?
Who makes the playoffs,who wins their division.
Yes,I have some thoughts.
Let's hear your division winners.
I'll start with The Afc.
New England wins the east.
That was tough.
Pittsburgh wins afc north.
I agree.
Afc west winner is the Denver broncos.
I think so too.
Afc south is won by is the Tennessee titans.
Again I agree.
And new England goes to the Super Bowl again.
I have to yes on that too.
Do they win?
Yes they win.
I can see that happening too.
We will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like pro football too, right?
Yeah I'm a big fan. Can't wait for this fall.
Do you follow how the season schedule is structured? I never knew.
Sure. I know, it can be somewhat complicated.
I know there are thirty-two teams. Then they start competing..
So back in 2002 there was an expansion and realignment.
Yeah and that's when I lost track of things. How does it work?
So now there are four divisions in each conference, see?
I'm still with you. Then what else?
The champions of each conference proceed to the NFL playoffs.
That part I have down. Just some of the regulations aren't clear.
Maybe you're thinking about the wild card teams.
I bet that's it. Those extra teams can muddle things up.
They've limited the number of wild card teams, so it should be clearer now.
I know I enjoy the fall season, plus the playoffs.
Speaking of rules and regulations, you know those of pro-football differ from college football, right?
I wasn't sure. Also I wasn't thinking about that.
So you could be watching a pro game as a college football fan and become thrown by the game rules.
Mostly I like the social aspects of the game.
No argument here. You and a lot of people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you coming over Wednesday?
Why?
NFL Supplemental Draft!
Like anything is going to happen. There were a total of ZERO Picks last year.
Maybe, but I love the hype.
Bingham's a decent DL, but I wouldn't give up one of next year's picks for him.
What about Marques Rogers? He was a serious threat RB.
Exactly - WAS. He was ineligible in 2016. Taking a whole year off makes that just too risky.
So what do you think the Titans did by taking Adoree Jackson with the 18th Pick?
Point taken.
Seriously, a 5' 10" CB?
I know, but he plays offense too. Not a bad Pick in my mind. Besides, I'd rather take someone steady like that than a Wild Card.
Who?
Conley. I wouldn't take someone with his criminal past unless I had to.
Yes, Off-Field drama can detract from a player's value, but the Raiders really need someone like Gareon.
They would've done just as well with Jabrill Peppers.
No, he's too slow. He's got good size, but isn't quick enough.
He ran the 40 in 4.46!
The speed that counts is during a play - He doesn't react.
Well now it sounds like you
XXXXXXXXXXX
you ready for some football
yes it has been to long i can not wait
who do you thing is gona win it all this year
it is way to early to tell to many things could happen
what did you think of the draft
it was ok but nothing like opening day kickoff
did you see the new schedule
yes looks like some nice monday nite matchups
how many hours do you plan to watch each sunday
i plan on wqatching at least six hours
are you going to throw any gameday party
i am not sure i might
what is your favorite team i like the jets
i like the green bay packers
hope they both meet in the superbowl
ya that would be great
i even dress my dog up in a jersey
i have a cat so im not gona try if i value my arms
countdown is on can"t wait
me to
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you watch the super bowl?
yeah. what made you ask me that?
because they had the replay on again last night.
what, it was on the n f l network?
yeah. i watched it again.
why?
nothing else was on.
man you stupid. how you gone watch a game and you already know who won?
easy. it's football.
i know right. i can't wait for the season to start.
i think training camp is two weeks away.
yeah it is.
who are you rooting for this season?
i don't know. i just like watching good games each week.
you don't have a favorite team?
the team i like ain't made no noise in a while.
which team is that?
the rams.
the rams? man, you're crazy.
i'm still stuck in the greatest show on turf era.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, when does the NFL season start?
I think preseason starts in mid-September.
Awesome, I can't wait.  Who's playing first?
I think the Chiefs and the Patriots are the first game in preseason.
That'll be an easy win for the patriots.
You think so? I think the chiefs are looking pretty good this year.
I don't think so, who do they have that's any good?
Are you kidding me?  They've got Travis Kelce and Kniles Davis.
Yeah, but a team isn't going to succeed with a good Tight End and a decent running back.
They've got more than that man, I'm not a chiefs fan, but I'm not going to deny talent.
Who else do they have?
Spencer Ware is going to break out and Nick Foles gets better every year.
Nick foles is garbage.
No he's not, he's much better now than when he was on the Eagles.
I'll give you that. But doesn't make them good.
I think Andy Reid will do some good things this year.
Super Bowl good?
No, not at all haha.
Alright, so at least we can agree on that.
Yeah, alright man, have a good one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can watch the falcons all day
They definitely have one of the most high powered offenses
Matt Ryan is a really good young player
I think that they are going to be competitive for a while
As long as their offense stays
Julio Jones is really fun to watch also
He's one of the best players in the league
I don't know if I'd go that far but he's definitely one of the best wide recievers
Him and Odell Beckham definitely are
Odell is really entertaining to watch
I love watching him
He's one of the most dynamic, entertaining players in the league for sure
I think he is one of the only bright spots on the Giants
I think that Odell will eventually leave the Giants though when he realizes they have no chance for a title
Yeah that makes sense especially after he makes his millions
He should look to a team with a more elite offense.
Can you imagine him playing with Tom Brady?
That team would be deadly and the patriots would win the next 5 super bowls
As fans of other teams, let's pray that never happens!
I'm with you on that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot wait for football season to start.
Seriously? It's the middle of summer.
I know, but I think the Steelers are really going to do well this year.
I hope they do, but you still have a problem
I know, the Patriots.
They really have the Steelers number.
They have everybody's number. Could you imagine the Steelers' Super Bowl trophy case if not for Tom Brady?
How many Conference championship games have they played?
Four, and that is the problem, they are in the same conference. So unless they can beat the Patriots they don't even get to go to the Super Bowl.
Did they win any of the four?
No, the Patriots won them all and then went on to win the Super Bowl, I think, every time.
Can anybody beat them?
I think so. Even though they lost, Atlanta showed that on any given Sunday, the Patriots can be beaten.
Are you sure about that?  I mean, the Patriots won the game.
I know, but they needed a lot of luck.
Isn't that what they have the most of? I mean, isn't it just luck that they win?
I'd like to think so, but I don't think that is really the case. There is another factor.
Tom Brady?
Yeah, Tom Brady. I think he is going to play until he's fifty.
That would be bad news for everyone else.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why were the Bears so bad last year?
Well, they had a ton of injuries on defense to start with.
Right. They lost Danny Trevathon and Pernell McFee and those guys were suposed to be the heart of the defense.
Don't forget that they lost Leonard Floyd to concussions.
Floyd. Did you see his interview about how he dealt with the concussions over the off season?
No, how did he manage to recuperate?
I don't think he did, actually. He said that he just sat in his room on his sofa and stared at the TV all day because he couldn't get up to do anything.
Wow, I never have experienced a concussion, so I have no idea how severe the recovery time is.
The scary thing is that research is showing that it's not the big hits that are causing the big damage, but rather the repetitive non-concussive trauma.
You mean all the regular hits that lineman take on every play?
Yes, these repetitive hits accumulate over a lifetime to produce serious damage to the brain.
Well, by the time these kids make it to the NFL, they've played and practiced hundreds if not thousands of hits already.
That really is scary. I kind of feel guilty enjoying a game where these guys are permanently hurting themselves.
Me too. I love a good hit as much as the next guy, but the reality is that this is a very violent sport.
What can they do to address the concussion issue?
Well, they have been expanding the "concussion protocol" where a doctor is required to be on the field and able to administer a battery of tests to a potentially concussed player.
I meant: will they change the game so that there are less hits during gameplay?
For sure. I think that they changed the kick-off distance for exactly that reason.
I played football all the way through high school, but I don't think I want my sons playing when they get older.
I agree, With this concussion issue gathering more data about health implications, there's no way I will let my kids play football, unfortunately.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm researching Ken Smith and his stats.
He has good ones.
He does.
What did you find?
He's scored the most touchdowns on his team.
That's impressive.
He also is the smallest player on his team.
Really? How much does he weigh?
He is 5'9" and weighs 155.
Yeah, he's pretty small.
He is lean muscle.
Absolutely.
Does that affect his game?
Well, I know he's faster because he's lean.
That makes sense.
He's a running back right?
Yes, he is.
Oh ok.
He is also only 26 years old.
He's a youngin!
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are a couple teams this year that could really make some noise.
Yea, a few seem to be on the decline.
What do you think about Philly?
Uhhh, I'm not sure. I think they have a a quarterback.
You like Wentz?
Man, that guy is a stud.
Yea, as long as they have playmakers around him, they will win.
Yea, last year, nobody could catch the ball.
Well, Alshon Jeffrey should solve some of that problem.
Yea, him and Torrey Smith were nice additions.
Yea, that with Ertz over the middle. Very nice!
Don't forget about their defense either. Fletcher Cox can ruffle some feathers.
Yea, he better do that or their secondary is going to get torched.
Yea, thats a major weakness. They have to figure that out.
Yea, I can't name one player on their secondary.
Come to think of it, I can't name any of their cornerbacks.
They do have a couple of great safeties, but time will tell if that is enough.
Yea, I don't know if even that will be enough.
Yea, well if they can get some pressure on the quarterback consistently, it just may.
You are right. We will find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you know anything about football or watch anything about the NFL?
Not really. My family are huge Oakland Raiders fans.
Well now they are the Las Vegas Raiders?
Wow, I didn't realize they were moving. Weren't they the Los Angeles Raiders at some point?
Yeah they were in the mid 80's to mid 90's. But now they are moving to Las Vegas.
Any particular reason why?
They say it was because the old stadium was falling apart and the team couldn't get it renovated in a way that the owners were happy with or something like that.
They must've really screwed up bad to lose the whole team
Well the proposals have been going on since 2009, so someone must have just gotten sick of dealing with it.
I don't know if Las Vegas is a good place for any sports team to be honest.
Yeah, me neither. But I guess we'll find out.
It's just so touristy, I don't see how they can consistently pull in a fanbase.
I agree, I go to Vegas to gamble, drink, and see unique shows. Not watch NFL.
Agreed. How long do you think it'll take for them to move.
The NFL commission has said that the Raiders will play in Oakland for 2017 and 2018.
Well at least my Bay Area family can still see them for a couple more years.
It may be longer than that, the stadium in Vegas has ran into issues off and on in terms of investors and building it.
It seems like they would need to build it away from the strip since that is already pretty clogged up.
I'm guessing so too. I don't think the NFL has thought this through all the way..
I guess we will find out in the next few years if the Las Vegas Raiders will be a real thing.

Are you ready for some football?!! The NFL season is just 6 weeks away.
Seems like we just started baseball season and now football is coming again?
Don't you like anything about football at all?
I like winning bets on games.
How can you bet? You know nothing of the NFL teams.
You don't need to know anything about the NFL when betting.
Yes you do!
No you don't. It's all a guessing game. I used to win my mom's office pool a lot and I went up against hard core Vikings and Packers fans doing so.
How did they handle losing to a high school kid?
They were put out at first but when they found out i never watched football and knew nothing of the game they really got mad.
I supposed I can see why.
I told them they only fool themselves if they think you can study a bet - its a freaking guess.
How did you do it?
I had a few different methods. Once I chose between the uniform colors I liked the better for each game. Once I would bet on whatever team had a cute quarterback.
I see, a real scientific methodology.
Nope, just a guessing game. And may I point out I won more than anyone so when you get snide I know you don't like hearing that you have no control.
I study the numbers of past games and look at the player stats, etc.
And yet I win by choosing the uniform colors I like better. You don't like being SHOWN that you're so-called method is as much BS as my uniform color method. You have no control, period.
OK, if you win this year you buy dinner.
Deal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man can anyone beat the Patriots?
Sure! The New York Giants did it twice in the Superbowl.
I miss Peyton Manning, Football isn't the same without him.
I know, that man was a machine.
The AFC dominates, since I was little it's always been an AFC team that won the superbowl
Not true, there's been several NFC teams that have won in the past 15 years.
Troy Aikman is a good commentator
Yeah but he's not as good as Troy Aikman
Will the Falcons ever "rise up" again?
Maybe, but it's more likely they "sit down"
I avoid the half time shows during the superbowl
I used to, the one year I went out to get food the Janet Jackson fiasco happened
I feel bad for the Browns, they won't ever see a superbowl
They will if they keep getting the first round draft pick every year
The Seattle Seahawks have some ugly uniforms
It looks like a blind painter made them
As long as the shuttles are free (and plentiful) I see no problem with this. Just don't try to catch one 15 minutes before kickoff and expect to be in the stadium on time.
People turn up to games that close to kickoff? What's the point in going if you aren't planning on hitting at least a little tailgate?
Why don't more teams use the hurry-up offense?
I know, this kills the defense of the team using hurry up
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Pittsburgh Steelers chances this year?
If they keep Big Ben healthy they have a shot.
They can be really good.
It's not just Big Ben either.
I'd say they're running game is pretty good too.
I would say so with Le'Von Bell.
What a great year he had.
How about Antonio Brown too.
One of the top receivers in the game.
He's such a big target.
They're all around offense is powerful.
They could start out 5-0.
Who do they play the first five games.
They play Cleveland,Minnesota,Chicago,Baltimore and the Jaguars before they face anybody good.
I see your point.
Then they get the chiefs.
Don't they play New England too?
Yes,in week 15.
Wow,that could be a huge game.
It could be for home,field throughout the playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any good stories?
I have a football story.
I love football.
Well, this is a sad football story.
Why?
Well, it is about the year I moved from Buffalo, NY to east Texas.
Let me guess...Bills fan?
YOu got it. I moved to Texas the first year the Cowboys played the Bills for the first time in the Superbowl.
That must have been really something!
You're telling me!  I moved from the shadow of Rich Stadium, in Orchard Park, NY, where a Buffalo Bills sweatshirt is considered a thing of beauty, to east Texas, where a Bills sweatshirt was considered a practice target for gun holders.
Fun.
My fun started when the Bills made it to the playoffs, and played Houston in the first round. If you weren't a Cowboys fan, then you were an OIlers fan.
That's right! That was the year of The Comeback!
That's right! The Bills overcame a 32-point deficit to defeat the Oilers in overtime!
That was a good game!
I never saw it because the game was blacked out where I was living!  So, after that game, I was a Bills fan in the Lonestar state...with a target on my back!
And then?
Then, somehow the BIlls made it to the Superbowl, only to face the other Texas team, the Cowboys.
No!
Yes.  And when the Cowboys crushed the Bills, every Texan in a 100-mile radius of where I was living felt that it was their personnal obligation to rub it in my face!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to an NFL game?
No but I really want to go. It is just so expensive!
Last year Jets and Dolphins tickets were going for $10.
Okay, let me rephrase. It is expensive to see a team I care about.
Aren't you a Pats fan?
Yes. Very much so.
Well, I guess you will never be finding cheap tickets then.
No and that's the problem. But it's okay. I watch on TV as much as I can.
I can't imagine you see a lot of games in your area.
It is hit or miss. I got a lot last year.
Well, at least you have post season every year.
It's not a given, but yes it's been pretty good lately.
Lately? When is the last time the Pats haven't the your division?
I think it was in 2008.
That is crazy! And wasn't that the year Brady was hurt?
Yes, and they still had a great record, but they lost the tiebreaker I think.
Since Brady started, haven't the Pats almost won all the division titles?
Every year except for 2002 and the year he was hurt.
As much as I hate to admit it, that is really impressive.
I know. It makes being a fan kind of easy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the upcoming NFL season?
I am, but honestly I like college football better.
No way. NFL is so much better than college ball.
I disagree. College football has the rivalries. The color. The music. So much more.
Maybe so, but you have to admit the quality of NFL is so much better.
Agreed in big games. But watching a bad NFL team play a strong NFL team can be pretty boring.
True but the same can be said for college football.
I will agree with that. But I love to watch my college's team.
But don't you feel the same towards your pro team.
They are the Browns so not really. Just joking. I agree but not quite as much.
Who do you think will win this year?
Well the Patriots are always good. Same with Seatlle, Denver, Green Bay.
I agree. To me the NFL season really gets going around Thanksgiving.
Agreed. Especially with cold weather, snow, etc.
Yep, and what is it with warm weather teams and domes. That and to much artifical turf.
I like watching the snow games and rainy games. Much better than 70 degrees inside.
So who wins it this year?
I will go out on a limb and pick the Patriots
Pretty big limb you are going out on. I am picking Green Bay.
Safe pick. Well should be fun to watch. See ya.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the surprise team this year?
I like Houston a lot. Adding Deshaun Watson was big for them.
Do you really think they'll improve over last year with a rookie QB?
They finished 9-7 last year and first in their division with a terrible QB
But there's no telling if Watson will be any improvement over terrible
I think you'l be surprised at how good he is. The guy wins ball games.
If he does have a good year, then they definitely have a team that can win a lot of games.
Last year they were without JJ Watt for much of the season.
So having Watt and Watson this year means they're due for an improvement.
Having a winning QB, which I think Watson will be, along with a stellar defense is the key to making it to the Super Bowl.
But they have to go through New England to get there.
Watson will be able to win 2-3 games on his own. I can't wait to see him run through defenses.
Do you think he'll be rookie of the year?
Yes. He'll put up very good stats for a rookie QB and I believe he'll lead the Texans to 13-14 wins.
I'll be shocked if he's able to put up good numbers. There's a reason he was taken number 12 with two other QBs ahead of him.
Scouts and GMs are obsessed with mechanics and potential to be a prototypical QB; Watson is not that.
Then what is he if he's not prototypical.
He's a Cam Newton type QB who is capable of winning games without filling up the stat sheet.
I hope so. Houston has been good for three years now, but they've finished 9-7 each time.
This is the year they either break out of that with the best record, or they falter with Watson.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how do you think the Dolphins will do next year?
I think they're not ready to overtake the Pats yet, but are getting closer.
Yeah, they seem to be stuck in that middle gear.
What they need is a better quarterback.
Tannerhill is good.  But he's just not an elite guy.
I know, ever since Dan left they haven't been lucky at that position.
It's tough, because he is too good to let go, and not good enough to keep.
That's the worst kind of QB if you ask me.
Yeah, makes it hard.  You can't do anything.
Maybe he'll turn it around next year.
Maybe, they did make the playoffs.
Yeah, they have been in and out over recent years.
Too bad they still have to get throttled by the Pats every year.
It makes it hard when you have to go through legends non-stop.
Well that's how Miami had if forever when Marino was up there.
Yeah, for the longest time the Pats were a joke.
Yep, people forget that.  They were in a division with Marino and Jim Kelley.
That must have been hard.   Getting pounded by hall of famers 4 times a year.
Yeah, now they do the pounding.
I agree.  They rule the AFC.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team these days?
I have two - one AFC and one NFC.
That is funny - I am kind of the same way.
Oh which ones are your favorites.
Well AFC - the Denver Broncos are my favorite and my most favorite overall.
I like watching them too, Seems like they are usually good!
And my favorite NFC team is the Washington Redskins.
Thats my number one team - lifelong Redskins fan.
I live near DC so I see alot of games and hear alot about them.
I grew up there, but live up near Boston now - so I am a Patriots fan too.
That is funny - we are similar I think, I spent alot of time in the Denver area - loved the Broncos
And we both like the teams where we live also.  I'd love to see them both in the Super Bowl.
I feel the same - if the Broncos and Redskins were in the Super Bowl - I think I would try to get tickets and go.
I think the weak side of that is thee Redskins though - they are not ready for Prime Time yet.
I agree they definitely are not super bowl bound. How about the Patriots? You think they can repeat?
With Brady and Bellichek - they seem to always have a chance.
Yeah great pair for sure! I think they are the concensus favorites to make it too the SuperBowl this coming season.
Yeah they should be better with the trades they made and Gronkowski back.
I know its amazing they won the SuperBowl without him last year.
Yeah he gone the whole playoff run.  Last year was definitely all Brady all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL football?
I love to watch NFL football.
Do you watch all the games or only certain ones?
I watch whatever games are on during Sunday afternoons and Monday and Thursday nights.
Why do you not watch on Sunday nights?
NFL games are on too late on Sunday nights and I have to work early.
That is a good reason. Do you have NFL Sunday Ticket from Direct TV?
No. What is that?
It allows access to watch all the games that are playing.
I watch on air games over my antenna. I am limited to what is shown in my local area.
That sounds awful! What games do you get to see?
I get to see the Tampa Bay games and a lot of Miami games.
Do you ever go to stadiums to watch games in person?
Not yet. I want to go to a Tampa Bay game someday.
I try to go to a game or two every season.
What is your favorite team?
I love the Atlanta Falcons. There is nothing like going to a game at the Georgia Dome.
That place looks really cool.
It is! You should come to a game with me. I think the Buccaneers play in Atlanta this season.
We should take a road trip and go see that game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How good are the Seattle Seahawks?
They are one of the best teams for sure.
You think Russell Wilson is a great Quarterback?
He isn't a bad quarterback.
I would say 2015 was a much better year then 2016 for him.
He would probably agree with you.
He had 13 fewer touchdowns and 3 more interceptions in 2016.
That is a reason for him to do much better this year.
You are right he will want to prove the haters wrong.
All he has to do is use their hate as motivation.
Well I'll keep an eye on the Seahawks games next season.
Good call there should be some exciting games.
I wish they played East teams more often though.
Yeah they don't play certain teams very much.
It would be nice if the schedule included a game against every other team.
They should all play at least once before the playoffs.
I know it makes no sense that they don't.
Maybe we should write a letter to the NFL.
If you write it I will sign my name.
Sounds good but I will sign my name first!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Cam Newton?
He is good but he needs protection.
I agree.
ANdrew Luck also needs protection.
hopefully these teams get their quarterbacks protection.
I agree they could get hurt.
andrew luck has already had multiple surgeries.
He had a recent one too
Hopefully he is ready for the season.
I hope so.
I think Cam will do better if he just gets some lines to help him.
Me too he is good at footballa nd has a great heart.
Yeah he gives all hsi balls to the kids.
That is a dedicated player.
Makes for more dedicated fans.
I am one of them.
I like him alot.
Me too.
I like the colts and what they did for chuck pagano
me too it shows there is more to the NFL than just football it is about family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey the NFL season will be coming up soon.
Yes, I know and I'm pretty excited.
I am too. The Dallas Cowboys were great last season.
Yes they were. I 'm sure it's going to be an awesome season.
I bet it is. I wonder who the backup quarterback will be?
I was wonder the same since Tony Romo isn't with them any longer.
Yes, and that's all good. He just wasn't a good quarterback anymore.
No he wasn't. It was time for him to retire from playing.
Yes it was. He had too many injuries the past few years.
Yes way too many injuries.
Dak Prescott turned out to be the best quarterback ever.
He really did. He's an awesome player.
He is awesome. He did a lot for the Cowboys last season.
Yes he did and I think this season is going to be great.
I think so too. Romo was good in the very first years of his career but later on he wasn't anymore.
No he wasn't. He was costing the team games.
He really was. He was throwing way too many interceptions.
I couldn't believe how many he had gotten to where he was throwing.
I know, everytime he threw the football I wanted to hide my eyes.
LOL so did I. That's pretty bad isn't it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite NFL team?
I like the Arizona Cardinals, but my family is full of Dallas Cowboy fans
Why do you like the Cardinals and not the Cowboys?
I think Larry Fitzgerald is one of the best receivers, if not one of the best players to ever play the game
I agree with you there, and I'd say the same about Odell Beckham Jr. on the Giants
You like the New York Giants?
They aren't my favorite team, but I do like OBJ and Eli Manning, and I'm excited about them getting Brandon Marshall
Yeah, now there's a great receiver tandem, like having Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski on the same team
Sure, but I hate the Patriots, even if they are full of talent
Me too; I'd like to see someone else winning in the AFC for once
How do you feel about the Steelers?
Same as you feel about the Patriots, I guess; I recognize the talent, but I'd like to see less of them overall
Makes sense, kind of how the Broncos faded into obscurity when Peyton Manning left
They still have a lot of great players like Von Miller and Demarius Thomas
I suppose so, but they didn't play so great last year
A lot of teams didn't play great but I think this next season is going to be a bit different with all the new acquisitions
Which team do you think is going to turn it around the most?
I think with a new coach and GM, the San Francisco 49ers have a pretty good shot
True, and there's nowhere to go but up when you have a two-win season and miss the playoffs
Man, I miss the old 49ers-Seahawks rivalry. Here's hoping the NFL is more competitive this season!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think RG3 will have a chance in the NFL?
I am not sure since he was cut from the Browns back in early March.
So he is stil a free agent?
Yes and I believe training camps have already started too.
I haven't heard of any teams reaching out to him yet.
That's just too bad.
I hear he just had a baby girl early this month.
Yes that is true. Her name is Gloria.
He is a former Heisman winner that led him to be the first round draft pick for the Cleveland Browns
Oh yeah I remember, what year was that?
I believe it was back in 2012.
I thought it was 2011, but Ok.
I think the NFL teams are looking at him as a risk.
Why do you say that?
Because last year he was injured and he was only limited to play 5 games.
Oh that is terrible.
Prior to that he sat on the bench the entire 2015 season as a backup to Kirk Cousins.
Well I see why he has not been picked yet.
I just hope too much time doesn't pass by or else he won't be able to play.
I totally agree with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Rams from 1999? I did not watch football back then and someone mentioned that team recently.
I sure do remember them. They were great.
Who was the quarterback?
The quarterback was originally Trent Green, but it eventually fell to Kurt Warner before the season started.
How did Warner do? Was he a good quarterback?
Warner was excellent. In fact, he set all kinds of quarterbacking records that year?
Do you have an example of a record he set?
Sure I do. One example is the number of passing yards in the Super Bowl.
The Rams were in the Super Bowl that year?
They won the Super Bowl that year. Kurt Warner threw a bomb of about 75 yards for the winning touch down.
Who did he throw it to?
I believe it was Isaac Bruce, and Torry Holt ran down the field with him the whole way.
That sounds exciting. And that was the play that won the game?
It was the final points scored, but the Titans had one last drive to try to tie the game.
What happened?
The Titans marched straight down the field and almost scored. They were stopped on the 1-yard line as time expired.
Wow, that must have been something to see.
It really was. So much happened in that game and the Rams were such an exciting team.
Who else was on the Rams that season?
They had Marshall Faulk, who had 1000 yard receiving and rushing, and Mike Jones, who made the tackle at the 1-yard line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
Whatcha doing today
Just chilling
Sounds boring
Sorta is
Why not do more
Meh
Well?
Why not come over and watch the game
Whose playing
Eagles are on
Playing against?
The colts
Well might be fun
It will
Okay
See you soon then?
Yeah for sure
Cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who does Manning guy play for?
You mean Eli Manning? He plays for the Giants.
No, the other one. His brother?
Payton Manning? He retired and does insurance commercial on TV.
Oh, well I guess that's how much I paid attention.
Speaking of commercial, have you seen one with Greenbay Packers players?
That one with the guys with long hair?
Yeah, Clay Matthews. He's funny.
Not a bad player either. He is a defensive player, right?
Yeah, kinda mean player. Effective though.
Not a big fan of the team though, me being Minnesota native.
That's understandable. I don't care for them myself too much. Fans are too crazy!
Not as obnoxious as Pittsburgh fans though.
Or the Raiders' fans...
Nooo! the Cowboys fans!!
Oh, yeah!! Cowboys fans are the worst!!!
They actually won some games last season, didn't they?
They did...drove me crazy!
Well, let's hope the vikings play good this season.
I have a good feeling about them this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's getting closer to football season are you excited?
I'm more excited about this season than I have been for a long time.
Why are you so excited about this season?
Because my Cowboys look like they're ready to make a legitimate Superbowl run this year.
You sure last year wasn't a fluke.
I'm positive it wasn't.
What makes you so sure about that?
Because they have the most dominate line in the NFL for starters.
Well that offensive line can't hide their lack of talent on defense.
The defense was missing key players last year and still performed better than expected.
Well that's still not enough to convince me that they're Superbowl contenders.
The Cowboy offense was one of the best in the league last year with key players injured.
What key offensive players are you talking about?
Collins wasn't playing last year because of a toe injury and this year is the first year Dez Bryant is going into camp injury free.
Ok I'll give you that, but will that be enough to help their defense?
They are going to be a dominant defense this year just watch.
I can't see them having a dominant defense, they lost key players in the secondary.
They have replacements that were getting plenty of game time reps and they are better than the players that left, in my opinion.
Well I hope you're right.
Me too, I can't wait for the season to start
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Patriots will win another Super With Brady and Bill Belichick?
I almost thing I would be surprised if they didn't.
Yeah, them seem to be unstopable.
For real. And what's amazing is that they really don't have a team full of superstars.
Yeah, just a bunch of role players to surround Tom and Bill.
I know people love to hate on them all the time. But I don't see how people can get that upset that they can keep winning.
I think people are convinced that they are cheaters.
Oh yeah! Deflate-gate add what was that other issue they had?
There was the thing a few years ago where they were accused of spying on other teams.
Oh yeah, that was it. I could not remember what it was.
Do you think they were quilty?
If they were, which I don't think the were, then they were only quilty of doing what all the teams do.
Yeah, it kind of seems like the media is out to get them.
That is kind of how I feel. No one wants to give them credit so they just vilify them and everyone buys into it.
That's too bad because they really are a great team. And that's what I think matters, great teams competing against each other.
No doubt! And I think the league is full of some really great teams now.
Me too. And there were a lot of key player pick ups in the league with the draft.
It wil be interesting to see which rookies really come out and make a huge difference for their teams.
It sure will, but you can count on this. Whoever are playing for the Patriots will have a great show at a championship with Tom and Bill at the helm.
That is for sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, NFL season is starting soon. I can't wait for the weekends during football season!
Yeah, me too. I've already got my recliner and remote ready to sit back and watch the games.
Which NFL team is your favorite this year?
I'm a true blue Dallas Cowboy fan, always have been and always will be.
Cowboys? No way man. I follow the Steelers every year!
The Steelers were a big disappointment to their fans last year.
They need a quarterback man...but this year I have the feeling it's going to be their year.
I would have thought you'd be a Redskins fan since you hate the Cowboys.
The Washington Redskins are all hype...preseason, they are great, then once the season starts, they fall apart.
Yeah, their players are either on or off. No consistency there at all.
Are you going to any of the games in person?
I plan to attend a couple Cowboy games when they play away, which puts them closer to us.
That's cool man. I would love to see Pittsburgh play but I'm definitely not going up there in that cold!
I think they may have a game in North Carolina with the Panthers, you could probably stand that one.
Good idea! I will have to check online and see the at home schedule for the Panthers.
Hey, if you find some reasonable tickets, I'd love to go if that's okay with you?
For sure! Nothing more fun that going to a NFL game with your friends!
Just let me know what the price of tickets are and I will pay for my seat.
Hey, road trip!!  Going to North Carolina to see the Panthers play!
I guess we will have to root for the Panthers as our home team!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team?
I'm a fan of the Buffalo Bills.
How do you think their new coach will do this year?
I think McDermott will really struggle this year.
Do you think he'll do better than Rex Ryan?
I think he's a better coach, but they still won't win much.
Really? I think that offense can be pretty good.
I just don't have much faith in Tyrod Taylor.
I think Taylor is pretty good. He doesn't turn the ball over.
That's because he doesn't take any risks even if he needs to.
That's true. Atleast you have LeSean Mccoy to watch.
Yeah, Mccoy carries the offensive load. If he gets hurt the season is done.
Injuries always seem to mess up a bunch of teams every year.
Well football is a pretty rough game.
I don't know what teams will do if the NFL adds more games to the season.
They're already allowed very little practice time. The quality of the games would get worse.
The NFL really needs a farm league.
I agree. It would really help the talent level grow.
Young quarterbacks would really benefit.
I don't know how much it would have helped the Bills. They always seem to pick terrible quarterbacks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Only a couple months before football begins again.
I know and I'm really excited.
Me too, my favorite team just finally got a replacement running back.
Which is your favorite team?
I'm a Seattle Seahawks fan.
So you're referring to replacing Marshawn Lynch?
Yes, hopefully our new running back will provide what we need.
Who is the new running back?
We traded for Eddie Lacy.
That might be a good fit, I've been a fan of his for some time.
I've been impressed with him in the past, but I'm concerned why Green Bay would trade him away.
That's definitely a valid concern.  Most teams wont trade high profile names unless there's some reason for them to do so.
I've seen lots of comments about his weight and it contributing to injuries.
I think I remember hearing that he was overweight.
I saw a couple games where he clearly looked to be too heavy.
Hopefully he'll be a hard worker for the Seahawks.
If he can stay in shape I think he will be the best addition to the team since Russel Wilson was drafted.
And if he can keep from getting injured.
That's always a concern, but I feel like he's more durable than the other guys we've had the past couple of seasons.
It seems like that Thomas Rawls guy is always hurt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Marcus Mariota will recover from his injury and lead the Titans to a 12 win season!
Wow that's a lot of confidence in Mariota.
Mariota showed that he was one of the leagues best quarterbacks last season when he was healthy and he barely had any weapons to work with.
I like Mariota better then Jameis Winston but I don't think he has enough to lead the Titans to a 12 win season.
Looking at the Titans division I think they have the best team.
That's true other than the Texans I don't see the Colts or Jaguars as posing much of a threat.
I can't fully rule out Andrew Luck with the Colts because he's such a good quarterback.
He is talented but he takes a lot of risk and gambles.
I think that's what it takes to be a star quarterback. You have to have the talent and confidence to take those chances.
He threw a lot of interceptions last season though.
Well the Colts trailed in a lot of games so they were forced to pass a lot.
That's true when you have to play from behind the defenses can predict what you're going to do and play accordingly.
Exactly, and for Luck to be able to come through in those situations proves that he's a talented quarterback.
Right, that's why I think the Colts aren't completely dead in the water even with the new roster they're fielding this year.
I just feel like the Titans have their team and they're sticking with Mariota as the face of their franchise. He's confident and everyone believes in him.
I do like his wide receivers. They're not household names but they get the job done.
They just need the running game to come alive this season again. That'll help out their offense by so much.
Do you think DeMarco Murray will hold up for another season?
DeMarco Murray is a tank I think he'll do what he did last season and with Derrick Henry backing him up to give him a breather they'll be fine.
It'll be exciting to watch how the Titans perform this season. I hope Mariota fully recovers from that broken leg.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believ it is almost time for the next season of NFL football?
Are you kidding?  It seems like forever since last season ended!
No, it seems like just yesterday that I saw the Patriots win another title...
That must be it!
What?
I just realized why it seems like so long since I enjoyed a game of football!
What do you mean?
I hate the Patriots!
So.
Don't you get it? I hate the Patriots!
I still don't understand.
You see, I hate the Patriots so much that my mind have blocked out all memories of last year's playoffs.
You mean you don't remember the Superbowl?
Not last year's Superbowl.  I remember the Broncos's victory the year before...
That means...
That's right...selective amnesia!
Incredible!
The pain of seeing the Patriots win another Superbowl was so traumatic that my brain has erased all memory of it from my conscious mind.
So, to you, it seems like two years since you saw a Superbowl!
Yeah, I don't remember a thing!  If only it worked the same way with ex-wives!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Patriots winning the Super Bowl last year?
I thought they were the best team coming in and their comeback in the second half was unbelievable.
Did you think they had a chance when they got down against the Falcons?
I really didn't once it became 28-3. That's a tall hill to climb and they hadn't shown any signs that they would come back.
They somehow got it going and made the plays they needed to.
Yes, the Falcons did make some poor play calls that helped, but the Patriots took advantage of every opportunity.
What do you think of the reputation of the Patriots as cheaters?
I think they were wrong in recording signals like they did several years ago, but I think the ball inflation/deflation was a big story about nothing.
Lots of people don't view their championships as being legitimate because of those scandals.
The thing is that it can never be proven that another team would have won if the Patriots hadn't done the things they were accused of.
I guess that's true, but I think it casts a cloud on them.
I think their championships are legitimate because they did win those on the field.
It just makes me wonder because if they were really confident in themselves they wouldn't need to cheat.
Maybe but I also think if you look at the results from the past several years they've shown how good they are.
Do you think they can win again next year?
Yes because I don't see Brady slowing down at all and Belichick is a great coach.
The Dolphins are going to be better next year, then there's the Steelers and Chiefs to contend with.
I think the AFC East is a bunch of patsies and the Patriots will walk all over them. They might get a challenge from the Raiders or one of the teams you mentioned though.
Yes, the Raiders. I think they may take that next step this year, them against the Patriots would be a great game.
We did miss out last year when Carr got hurt because a Raiders vs. Patriots match up would be a lot of fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about this upcoming football season?
ooh yes, I am!
I am excited to watch the giants.
I love the giants.
They are fun to watch with the players the got.
Yea, Manning and Beckham.
Yea, its a great duo.
I wonder how many fines will be handed to him this year.
I think they cut down on that.
Hope so, the players should be able to celebrate a little more.
I agree.
Its like they dont want to see a guy get excited about the sport.
Plus it is good for fans.
Yea they like it.
Watch out for the patriots though.
Of course, they are good every year.
Yup, so is Tom Brady.
He will never age.
He will have like 10 rings when its over.
Haha, yes he will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team wears purple?
The Vikings
What state are they from?
Minnesota
Cool, they must play in a lot of snow games
They have had their share
I like their team
Me too. I love their old team
The one with Moss?
Yes
And Culpepper?
He was a great QB
I'm disappointed they never won a title
Me too. They had a great team
Carter was an amazing receiver.
He really was. I loved watching him
I hope they put together another great team
They have potential.
They also have great fans
Their stadium is very beautiful
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what's up man? You excited for the Seahawks season?
Oh for sure dude! We're gonna be great this year.
I know - don't you think Russell Wilson is just amazing?
For sure man. Don't forget Richard Sherman.
Oh yeah, but isn't there some beef between them?
I think its probably overblown homie. You know how the media is.
Yeah ,no doubt about that. They blow everything up.
For sure bro. How about the Packers, I know you follow them too right?
Yeah...well, I did. But I don't really like Rodgers much anymore.
Why not dude? Isnt he great?
Yeah, but there's been a lot of talk about his attitude...not good
Oooh yeah, a bit of a prima donna that one.
No doubt man. Tough to have that vibe when its a team sport...
Oh yeah bro. 53 players all gotta be on the same page and buy in
Speaking of buy in, you springing for season tix this season?
I might...I still have a PSL so I'm eligible...but man, so expensive!
I know man...the owners really got us over a barrel on this one. Its nuts how pricey tix are these days!
Plus man...its so nice to watch on TV. HD, the zoom cams...just incredible
Yeah and totally relaxing
For sure...who would've thought football of all sports would be relaxing, huh?

I like the DALLAS COWBOYS logo.
It is simple.
It used to be a solid Star.
In 1964 they added the stripe around it.
The owners other team uses that logo.
It is used for the TEXAS DESPERADOS.
That is an AFL team.
Their home jersey is royal blue.
And pants are silver.
They call it the STARS AND STRIPES jersey.
They use a serifed font for the letters.
Helmets are silver.
They also have a blue and while stripe.
They player's name is also on the helmet.
But it is in small letter.
When they started in the 1960's the helmet was white.
They got the current uniform style in 1964.
In 1970 they started putting players names on uniforms.
In 1976 the helmet also had a red strip.
That was for the USA bicentennial.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, well if Seattle isn't good. I wonder who that opens the door for.
I guess Arizona could complete, but I do not think that they will.
Yea, Arizona isn't very good I do not think though.
Yea, especially with Carson Palmer aging now.
Yea, Carson Palmer is getting older, but they do have a couple players.
Yea, they have had a strong defense in the past, but I don't know if they still do.
Yea, they could compete, but I think Seattle is still ahead of them.
Yea, they have a great defense too.
Yea, they are much more experienced and have a winning pedigree.
Yea, there is something to be said for winning.
Yea, Atlanta also now has been there before.
Yea, It's too bad they didn't win last year.
Yea, they really blew that one, didn't they?
Yea, they really had that game, but they sure blew it.
Yea, I guess when you are playing the Patriots, you just cannot relent.
Yea, they just have the winning formula.
Yea, it is tough to bet teams that have them.
Yea, I agree. New England has won in the past and still win.
Yea, they sure have and that is tough to beat.
Maybe the falcons will next year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did players in the NFL originally wear leather helmets?
Yes, but it was a long time ago.
How long?
It was when the league started.
When was that?
The NFL started in the 1920s.
When did they phase out the leather helmets?
First, they changed them from soft leather to hard leather.
When did that happen?
It occurred in the in 1930s.
What was the next change?
They added logos in the 1940s.
But, the helmets were still leather?
Yes, they were leather until the 1950s.
What happened then?
The advances in technology resulting from the war led to many things being made from plastic.
That includes football helmets?
Yes, in the 1950s, helmets were made from plastic.
Was that the last development?
No, today's helmets are made from polycarbonate. And, the design continues to improve.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick one wide receiver, any wide receiver of your choice, to start off your NFL team, who would you take?
In previous years this question would be a tough answer but I think in current years it's an easy choice. I take Julio Jones.
You would take Julio Jones easily over Odell Beckham Jr.?
Right now, yes, definitely because Julio has proven himself as an elite NFL wide receiver. The numbers he's put up in Atlanta for the Falcons the past years have been phenomenal!
You don't think it's due to having a talented and skilled quarterback like Matt Ryan?
I think Matt Ryan helps a lot of course, but let's not overlook how quick and big Julio is. There is no defensive coverage that can shut him down, and no cornerback can cover him one on one!
I like Odell Beckham Jr. I would take him but I completely understand you taking Julio Jones.
I like Odell too but he's still too young. Just because he made some eye opening, jaw dropping, amazing catches doesn't solidify him in my eyes as being on Julio's level just yet.
I can understand that. Odell still has a lot to prove, he disappeared in the playoffs last year for the Giants and that's not going to cut it.
That's what I mean. He's super talented and skilled, makes amazing catches, but aside from not knowing some techniques to lose defenses, he has that temper!
He's quite the hot head. It seems opponents can easily get into his head. Previous years when they played Carolina when Josh Norman was there, he disrupted Odell's concentration a lot.
He continued doing that, Josh Norman that is, in Washington.
That's right Josh Norman is on the Redskins now.
I think Odell needs to really grow up and be a true professional. Look at how Julio carries himself on the field and off the field, that's the type of leader and star wide receiver you want.
I see your point, I'm just really excited about Odell's big play potential. He's so entertaining to watch because you don't know when he's going to do something that'll just blow your mind.
In a few more years we'll see if Odell lives up to this early potential and hype. I think if he does mature he'll get there.
I'm not really sold on Eli Manning as the Giants quarterback going forward. He's so inconsistent in his performances for me.
That's been Eli's game though. You can criticize it but at the end of the day he's still a two time Superbowl Champion and seems to be Tom Brady's kryptonite.
It's amazing isn't it how Eli always seems to have Tom Brady's number when they match up in the big game.
Eli also did that without Julio Jones level wide receivers in those Superbowls. He made average wide receivers look better then they were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Giants' chances this year in the NFC?
They have a good shot in the east, but do you really think they can win the conference?
Maybe, Eli still has the Super Bowl arm, but I am worried about Green Bay
RODGERS!!! DISCOUNT DOUBLE CHECK. Don't sleep on A T L
True, Ryan and Julio will probably light it up again this year. Who do you like in the AFC
The Jets....HAHAHAHAHA Nah, New England has to be the favorite
The Pats? Even with all of the hooplah surrounding the aging Brady and less-than-stellar D?
Absolutely, We are even going to a game this year in Foxboro
Oh yeah? Nosebleed seats?
50-Yard-Line actually, I'm gonna be hanging with the Gronk. Who do you like?
I think Mariota and Tennesee will be the favorite in the south...
Over Luck and the Colts?
Absolutely. Chiefs out West...
Chiefts out West? Now I know you're out of your mind. You think Andy Reid is going to suit up and block? Denver out West
Denver? Please, they haven't been good since Vonn Miller realized his Madden Avatar was prettier than he was
Ha. Well, At least we know one thing.
What's that?
The Jets aren't going to be playing more than 16
Yeah, probably not. Hey What's Rex Ryan doing now a days anyway?
Who cares? Maybe he's somewhere on the Jersey Shore hanging out with You know who...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is that you're wearing?
My fan outfit.
Fan outfit? For what?
For the Redskins game!
But you look like a farm animal!
What's your point?
Redskins are indian braves...proud warriors and something to be feared, respected, and revered.
Yeah. So?
What does your outfit have to do with that?
Nothing.
Then why would you dress up like a pig in skirt?
I'm not a pig, I'm a hog!
Pig...hog...same thing!
You obviously know nothing about the rituals and traditions of football.
I have been a Bills fan for 20 years. I have never dressed like a farm animal.
It would be an improvement on your part.
You're avoiding the issue!
The hogs are a tradition!  We represent the enormous, powerful, snorting beast that resides in every Redskin offensive lineman.
Well, if that is the best you can do, I feel sorry for you. I'll make it up to you by bringing the Bar-B-Que sauce to the next game.
The only ribs you'll be seeing will be your own!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the recent draft?
I don't think there were many stars this year
Yeah I think this draft class is not gonna do well
I'd say thats the most likely outcome
Yeah, I think the college selection was poor this year
I wonder if it will be better next year
It depends on the incoming class of high schoolers
Yeah I suppose
Teams can't be good without a steady influx of new talent
I think that's why the same teams have been winning a lot
Yeah the veterans overpower the teams with younger players
It's kind of sad to be honest
They just need coaches with more vision
I'm sure that someone will come along that knows what they're doing
I'd have to say so
They basically have no other option lest they keep losing
The best teams will know how to adapt
It's gonna be interesting to see how the scouts delevop
I love it when young players turn out to be extremely good
I love seeing new players in the league often
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest NFL team of all time?
Pittsburgh Steelers
What?! How can you say that?
They've won 6 Super Bowls
But what about the Patriots?
They've only won 5
Yeah, but they have Tom Brady.
You asked me about the greatest team in the NFL, not the QB
Well, I think the Patriots have the upper hand.
How so?
They have more iconic players and they've done more recently.
You're forgetting about the Steelers of the 70s.
I'm too young to remember.
That's the problem. You're only comparing recent history.
Well it was a different generation of football back then.
Doesn't matter. Still in the Super Bowl era.
Yeah, but the game's changed so much since the 70s.
But those earlier Super Bowls still count.
I don't think so.
Well I think you're wrong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the New York Giants Super Bowl run?
Yes
Which one was your favorite?
The first one
That catch was amazing
my heart was pounding
Mine too
I did not think they would get the second one though
Me neither
They are only team that can beat the Patriots
Eli Manning is great in the clutch
I think Brady might be more clutch
Yeah, against everyone but the Giants
I hope they play again
Me too
Who do you think would win the third match?
Giants again
Really?
Yes
That is very possible
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team are you a fan of?
The Giants.
Because of a few years ago?
No man, it's hereditary. I've been a lifelong fan.
Oh yeah?
Yeah one of my first memories is the Super Bowl against the Bills.
The wide right game?
Yeah. Interestingly, the Giants wanted it to come down to that.
What do you mean?
They planned to let Thurman Thomas run all over them.
Okay...
But didn't want to let Jim Kelly complete a pass.
So they had a lot of long downs?
Exactly. Make a lot of 3rd and forevers.
So what, they made Norwood kick?
Yeah, they knew he wasn't a great kicker at distance.
That's a pretty clever trap.
Set by Bill Belichick.
Whaaaaaat?
Yep, he's an evil genius.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you an Eagles fan?
I am. They're my favorite team.
Mine too.
That's awesome. What did you think of their draft?
I thought it was okay. I thought some picks were weak.
I agree. I felt they kind of wasted their 14th overall pick.
Yeah, and that was the biggest deciding factor of their draft.
Derek Barnett is a good player but I don't feel it was the best choice.
I agree there. They could have picked a player that would make a bigger difference.
I think they were probably just looking at the fact that he has a knack for getting to opposing quarterbacks.
He does get a lot of sacks. That's a bit too situational to justify that pick, though.
I totally agree. I thought Sidney Jones was a good pick, though.
I agree. He's probably the number one cornerback right now as far as I'm concerned.
I almost couldn't believe they landed him as a second round pick.
I think the only reason they did was because of his achilles injury.
Yeah, I suppose that does make it a risky pick.
We've seen players come back from injuries like that before, though.
Yeah, if he returns at one-hundred percent then they lucked out with that pick.
True, but that's what makes it a risk. He may not return at full health.
True. Injuries like that have a tendency to get in your head.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the 49ers win their first Super Bowl?
Back in 1982.
Wow, that long ago.
Yeah, it's been awhile.
Do you remember who they played?
The Cincinnati Bengals.
Oh I didn't realize the Bengals made it to a Super Bowl.
Yes, they've been twice.
Was Joe Montana playing back then?
Yes, a very young Joe Montana
Rookie year?
No, I think he was in his third year.
Any big players on the Bengals.
Anthony Munoz was the most famous. Not many after him.
Oh he played offensive line right?
Yes, that's him.
Yeah, I remember him. Played for a number of years.
Yes, almost all for the Bengals and then a small stint with Tampa Bay.
Tampa Bay...crazy.
Yeah, they weren't very good back then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bud, who you got this year, Pats or Seahawks.
Seahawks, what are you smoking, they wont even make it past the wild card game.
Wow, ok so who do you think is going to make the superbowl then
Its going to be atlanta again.  Matt ryan has a chip on his shoulder after last years game.
You may be right.  If they do make i back i at least hope that they get a rematch with the patriots so they can avenge that horrible loss.
I don't care so much about that, id rather not take the chance of the pats getting another ring.
Do you hate the Pats that much?
I don't really hate them i guess, but i like it better when there aren't dynasties in sports.  Spread the wins around a bit.
That can be boring though, i like when you have a team that you know is just dominant.
As long as it isnt the Pats im good.  I dont mind when a team from a certain division wins the division several years in a row.
Yeah like the packers, ill always root for them since im not a bears or lions fan.
What about the vikings?
I do like the vikings, and their stadium is AWESOME, have you seen pictures of it?
Yeah its almost a rival of jerry world.  Just incredible how opulent they are making them now.
Anything to get the people to come watch the games i guess.
Do you think that fans arent supporting the NFL for some reason?
Not necessariliy, i just know that it costs a TON to go to the stadium to watch a game, so you have to do something to make it worth the amount you have to pay.
Thats true, i guess its not really something that the average family could afford.  Easier to just watch it on TV too.
Yeah, they are making a lot of money on TV deals since so many people are choosing to watch that way now.
Its crazy the revenue that is generated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football!?
Not at all with the way my Jets are poised.
What do you think they are going to do? I can't see them winning more than 3-4 games.
I know and that doesn't put us in the best place for next years draft.
You guys desperately need a quarter back.
You think? Hackenberg is a bum.
Yeah but you don't have any other options. It would be best if they just lost every game this year to get a good pick.
There are some great quarterbacks poised to come out of the draft next year.
Sam Darnold may be NFL ready and if you guys land him you might be poised for a winning season.
Your right! Same thing with Rosen. He might be NFL ready also.
There's no guarantee though. How do you ask professional athletes to purposely tank a season?
You can't it's not going to happen. They're going to try to win as they should, but it's not going to put us in a good position.
At least they're not Cleaveland.
They might as well be the Browns, I wouldn't be surprised if we lost to them this year.
Well anything can happen. Maybe Hackenberg can turn things around.
I don't know. We got rid of almost every player that helped us get close to the post season in 2015.
Hope Hackenberg has a better year, and that talented defensive back field is conditioned.
Yeah I have a feeling they are going to spend a lot of time on the field.
They better start running sprints now or you guys are going to get scored on in the second half all year long.
Tell me about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you looking forward to most about the upcoming NFL season?
I am just hoping that the Pittsburgh Steelers can finally get back to the Superbowl,
I did not know that you were a Steelers fan.
Yes! I have been a huge fan ever since I was little.
Do you have high expectations for them this year?
yes, I think we can go all the way if things fall in place!
I really thought they were going to the Superbowl last year.
I did to; the Patriots were just to good though!
Yea, beating Tom Brady at home is a very tough thing to do.
It sure is! We really need to get home field advantage this year to have a chance.
That would certainly help quite a bit.
I really want Ben Roethlisberger to get one more ring before he retires.
Even if he fails to do so, he will still be considered a legend when he decides to hang them up.
I agree with you about that! I think he will be in the Hall of Fame one day.
Do you think he is the best quarterback in Steeler's history?
In my opinion he is because of all the things he has accomplished.
He has been great, but I think I would go with Terry Bradshaw over him.
A lot of people say that, but I was not old enough to watch him play.
He was really good! He won four Superbowl's in a six year period.
My dad has always said he was the best quarterback ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who were you rooting for in the Super Bowl last year?
The Broncos, of course!
Yes, silly question I know...
Where did you watch the game?
I was at my best friend's house...rooting for the Panthers.
How upset were you that the Broncos won?
I was pretty angry at the time but I got over it.
I hope the Broncos can do as well this year!
Do you think they will?
I honestly don't know.  There are a lot of great teams.
True.  It would be nice to see the Panthers do well.
I think they will.  A lot of money goes into that team.
Well, they sure do have a lot of talent.
Of course, they're also surrounded with some controversy.
It seems like every time is sooner or later!
Yes, I just don't let it impact my enjoyment.
I don't either.  Wouldn't it be amazing if it was the same two teams in the Super Bowl this year?
It sure would!  It would be unlikely though...
I know but I would love too see the Panthers get a rematch!
If that happens we'll go together!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who wins the Super bowl this year?
Can you really count the Pats out?
they cant win it every year
Oh but they can.
I think the Falcons go back to the Super Bowl
No way they are going to have a down year dealing with injuries I bet
So who in the NFC then can challenge them
I hate to say it but Dallas.
Are you betting on Prescott having a huge year again?
Yeah I think he will, theres no pressure for him.
So then go to the AFC
The Pats until Brady retires.
OK but outside of that, dont you think a team like Pittsburgh could challenge?
They will but I worry about Ben's health year in and year out.
What about the Chiefs?
They will be hampered by the Maclin release.
I think they have a good offense either way, Kelce is a bigger threat.
The Titans might make the jump this year.
I dont think they are quite ready yet.
So really its the Patriots and no one else in the AFC!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Panthers?
No not really. They aren't a popular team
I know what you mean, they are probably one of the worst teams of the league
Their stats for last year were sort of bad.
Did they lose about eight games last year?
Uh huh I think they only won about five
Why do you think that is - I mean is it the coaching or what?
Obviously the coaching and bad draft picks. The skills of the players have alot to do with it
Who are their draft picks this year
They signed about eight new players. But best draft choices would have to be Moton and McCaffrey
We have yet to see what they will do for the team
They may need to draft a new coach too
You don't think Cam Newton gets the job done?
He could do better !
Yeah, Really I mean eight losses.
What strategies do you think he needs to employ?
His players need to be much  stronger on the offensive
Truly and reviewing tapings from last years games might help a little more
It just may.
The fault doesn't only lie with the coach though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what happens on 9/7/2017?
Whats happening ?
The first NFL for this season
Whos playing?
The Chiefs and Patriots.
Where at?
At the  Patriots home stadium.
What time does it start and do you know what station is airing it?
It starts at 7:30 on NBC i cant wait.
I hope the Chiefs win
Why so much hatered toward the Patriots.
I am tired of Tom Brady and Bill Bellichek
I really want to see the Steelers Patriots game.
Do you know when that is
The Steelers play them on December 17,2017 at 3:25.
I would love to see that game.
I know your a die hard Steelers fan.
Definatly my whole family grew up in Pittsburgh and loving the Steelers.
We should go see the steelers and Patriots game together.
Sure only if we sit in my Steelers section.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?!
Yeah man I can't wait!
I think this is going to be are year.
Yeah man our qb is looking good
We need to get to the playoffs
It's been to many years
I hope nobody gets hurt
we will see at training camp
I hope Doug does better this year coaching
He had to ease into it I think it's his year
I am excited about out draft picks
Yeah man he looks awesome
What do you think about Revis?
I think he would really be a great addition
I am glad we didn't have a big roster turn over
Yeah, these guys play well together.
What are your thoughts on Lurie?
I like him as an owner. He is a fan first.
Did you hear about Cox?
Yeah I heard he ranks as #4. That's awesme
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the new Falcon's stadium next season?
I don't know a lot about it. Is it called Mercedes Dome or something like that?
To tell you the truth, I know it is Mercedes something. But I'm not sure what exactly.
Is it going to be bigger than the Georgia Dome?
Oh yeah, a good bit. And it is very innovative.
How so?
It has a retractable roof that is different from any other current stadium.
That sounds interesting. Do you think the Falcons will have a good season?
I sure hope so. Especially that devistating lose in the SuperBowl last year.
Yeah, that was a big disspointment.
It sure was. I really hated that they lost, but I think it is unfair how bad people talk about New England.
Oh I agree with you. Love them or hate them, they never gave up and earned that victory.
For sure. That said, I hope the Falcons meet the Patriots again in the SuperBowl next year to get some revenge.
Do you think they would win?
I really think it depends on the coaching staff. I think they have just been too soft.
I've heard people say that. They do have unbelievable players.
Some of the best in the NFL! I just don't think the coaching staff has taught them the right discipline to finish a game.
That sure is what happened in the SuperBowl!
For sure. Hopefully next season is the year they take it all!
Hopefully! And in a new stadium, that would be epic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you a fan of the NFL?
Definitely. I love watching football.
Who is your team?
I am a Vikings fan. How about you?
I watch the Seahawks mostly. Do you think the Vikings are going to win this year?
I kind of doubt it. Our quarterback is injured.
What happened?
His knee got hurt two years ago and he is still recovering from surgery.
That is crazy. Those guys really do take a ton of abuse.
That is true. So many talented players have shorter careers because of injury.
Do you think the NFL needs to do a better job protecting players?
I am not sure you can. Football is a very physical sport.
Yeah, I agree. Who did you think is the best rookie this year?
He got drafted later, but I really like Leonard Fournette out of LSU.
I watched him play. He is a really physical running back.
Yeah. He reminds me of Reggie Bush.
Is Reggie Bush still playing?
Maybe? Last I checked, he played for the Lions.
Amazing how a guy can be that good and then gone in a few years.
Yeah, you never know who will last and who won't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about football
Great i love football
Me too
I really like the seahawks
I love their colors
Me too
They are so bright
Who do you like
I really like the titans
They are a pretty good team
Ive been a fan since i can remember
Im the same way with the seahawks
I think most real fans are that way
Exactly
I dont like peiple that go for the team that is doing well
I know sports is suppose to be about loyalty
I agree
Always be loyal to your team
Exactly
Everyone needs to be like that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there will be any new teams soon?
I don't know. Not sure where there is good market.
What city would you like to see a team in?
Maybe Salt Lake City?  A new sports team could help the economy?
Why do teams move or relocate?
Not really sure. I think the fans don't like it too much when they move?
Do you think football is safer than it used to be?
Sometimes. The NFL is constantly looking at rules and the equipment is continually improving.
What team would you like to see win?
A team that hasn't won in a long time, maybe the Minnesota Vikings.
Do you think tickets are too expensive?
They seem to be, particurlary in the big cities like New York and Philadelphia.
Do you think the NFL should draft kids right out of high school?
If they are good enough, why not? The only problem is no back up plan if the person gets injured.
Do you think certain colleges get looked over when it comes to the NFL draft?
Just like any sport, certain colleges are more recognized in the sport, and others not so much.
Would you let you son play football in the NFL if he was able?
Absolutely, as long as kept himself healthy and out of trouble.
Do you think there is too much pressure on players to win?
There is alway going to be pressure to do well and win. It is just a matter of making your best effort.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Cleveland Browns.
Wow. It must be hard to stay committed to a bad team.
I have high hopes this year, new coach and better atmosphere.
But still no QB though.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Um. ok, then I don't know what I was thinking. no wait, I do know what I was thinking. I mean do that for all the teams,
Oh. So you have 32 data points on 3 axes? Well, then what? Even then, it's not any more informative than just looking at the numbers.
It will the comparison easier. You can sort the teams by run efficiency, and then reception efficiency and maybe scoring efficiency.
What on earth is a scoring efficiency?
I don't know... maybe TDs per drive distance?
That is not a scoring efficiency, that's more like... Ok I have no idea what that is, but it's not how efficient the scoring was.
it shows you TDs per distrance, that's efficiency... I think...
Uh... no... it shows you that the punt was good, and the drive was long, and that the team was able to score. How is that scoring efficiency?
Hm, ok so that's more like will to succeed, so I the TDs per distance of drive is small, that means the drive was long. Which also means the team was determined to score.
That's just score divided by the total yardage. The NFL keeps track of that as well.
So make a graph of it.
No. It's too much work.
Please, I wanna see, it might be informative.
It won't be any more informative than what is already compiled by the NFL, ESPN, etc, besides, total offense stats like that are meaningless unless you compare it the total defense of the opposing team, which is also curated on the websites.
Woo, that gices me an idea.
Oh God. Don't tell me
If we divide the two, then we get a ratio. So divide the offense's run efficiency by the defense's run defense efficiency
How on earth are you going to get the defense's run defense efficiency?
Runs allowed per game, and yardage allowed, the same way as offense's efficiency. But looked at as a loss as opposed to gain
Huh. and the ratio offense/defense is greater 1 if the offense has better run efficiency that the defense? You know what, let's do this for and pats and cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah I'm a fan.  You?
Yeah I like it as well.
Who is your favorite player?
I like Odell Beckham.
He's good, but a little too cocky for me.
He's just a wide receiver that's how they are.  He's not as bad as TO was.
TO used to crack me up.
That popcorn one was the best for me.
Remember when he had a cellphone in his sock and took it out.
Yeah that was great.
Didn't he autograph something during a game as well?
Yeah he had a sharpie in his sock and signed something.
That guy is great.
Who's your favorite player?
I like Drew Brees a lot.
I can respect that.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why is football so popular in the US?
I think because it unites towns.
It gives kids a chance to shine.
It is very important to some towns.
It was really important to my home town.
Friday nights were highlighted by football each fall.
I can remember that too in my town.
Each week we knew what we were doing on Fridays.
I remember that as well, drinking hot cocoa and cheering on the team.
The football team were like movie stars in my town.
Yeah, they were treated like that.
They were even on television each week.
Really?
We had a tv station at our school and they taped each game for many years.
They must have gotten good studying the plays.
Yes, they would take time in school to view the videos and learn from them.
It sound like football really was a big deal there.
They were.
Wow, did they get recruited to college teams?
Yes, a lot did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new season is right around the corner.  Who's going to take it all this year?
I'm going to go with the Patriots or Oakland
Oakland really?
Yeah, they got the raw deal last year with their QB.  I wouldn't mind seeing them win
I can see your point.  Who is your favorite team.
I am an Oakland fan.  Raider Nation!
I am a Chiefs fan.  I don't think we can be friends.
Oh, come on now!  Nothing like a friendly rivalry!
Yeah, you're right I suppose.
Who do you think will win it all?
I agree with the Patriots.  Brady just gets better with age.
I know! I think that guy is immortal.
He very well may be.  But time catches up with everyone eventually.
That's true.  His time is limited.
Who is your favorite all time player?
I would have to go with Jerry Rice.  I loved watching him play.
Good choice.  He was a great receiver.
What about you?
I would say Joe Montana.
Seems we are both closet 49ers fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think football has changed in the past 10 years?
Definitely. The NFL has come a long way to making the game safer for it's players.
Do you think they have added to many rules that it now makes the game boring?
On some things they have, like the celebrations in zone after a touch down.
Your saying it's to controlling?
Of course, players should be allowed to celebrate a touchdown, they work hard to get it.
So, the NFL should allow any celebration the player wants to do?
Well within a respectful way, nothing derogatory to the fans or opposing team.
How do you feel about the red flag Replay system?
The NFL needed this system 20 years ago, it's a plus but can be improved.
How can they improve the redflag system without adding to much time to the game?
They can make it mandatory to use on 4th downs and touchdown disputes.
Do you think technology improves the game?
Yes it does. It can cut down on human error from the officials, they do miss a lot of calls.
If the NFL added more officials on field would that help?
It's a chance that it may work, who knows they should at least try.
How do you feel about the crazy rules when it come to the quarter backs?
The rules and calls are crazy, it's a physical game people get hit, hard.
You feel the quarterback should be free game to get hit?
If a guy 300 plus pounds is in the act of sacking the quarterback they cannot stop themselves from hitting the target.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
I think it's really disappointing.
Yeah, you have been a Raider fan ever since they moved back to Oakland
I feel like the ownership really didn't make any effort to stay in Oakland and I think its a crummy way to treat such a loyal fanbase
Well, they paid good money to Carr to keep him for the future.
Yeah, I think he's great and hopefully we can make the most of the remaining time they have in Oakland
How do you feel about the acquisition of Marshawn Lynch?
Beastmode! I think it's aweosme.
Yeah, that was a great move for your team
I thought it was so cool that he said he would only to come play for us.
I always respect a player who wants to come back to his hometown and show some love to the hometown fans
Its cuz the Raiders have the best fans in the league!
Some people would beg to differ.
That's just because they haven't been to a game.  The fans are really loyal, but we're also really cool.
What about the Black Hole?
Yeah, we're the only team without a mascot.  The fans are the mascot for the Raiders.  The Black Hole is amazing.  People only think they're scary.
Do you think you'll stay a fan after the move?
I can't really see that happening.  I feel like the only people that will attend the Vegas games are fans of the visiting teams who also wanted a vacation, and guests of corporate bigwigs.
Yeah, I think Vegas will kinda suck the soul out of the team and the fanbase.
At least my Sundays will be a lot more free in the fall!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Oh I love it!
What's your favorite team?
Bills
Go Bills!
Yea, man.  How do you think they'll do this year?
Well they are redefining the roster
Yea I heard that
So I think we got a shot!
Oh I bet we do!
Yea bro!  I got season tickets and everything!
Season tickets!?  Expensive!
Not if you're a true fan like me!
Or a rich fan..
Haha! No I've just been saving up for them for some time
Yea they gotta be a lot!
I can sell you the games that I won't be at
Sounds awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a football fan?
I am. It's one of my favorite sports.
Yeah, me, too. I'm a big Cowboys fan.
Yeah, I like them. I tend to support the home team, wherever I live.
Oh, you do? So you're a Steelers fan right now?
Yeah, I'm a big supporter.
I've always liked them, too.
And I used to be a Green Bay fan when I lived in Wisconsin.
You like what Mike McCarthy has been doing with them?
I do. I think he's been inspirational to the team.
What other teams do you like?
I'm a fan of the Rams, even though their history has been spotty.
Yeah, Sean McVay has his work cut out for him.
Speaking of California, what do you think of the Raiders?
Awful team. I mean, they haven't had a championship since 1984.
Maybe the move to Las Vegas will alleviate that a bit.
Maybe. I don't know if Vegas is the best place for them.
Who knows? Couldn't be worse than Oakland.
I guess it's up to Jack Del Rio.
Guess so, yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any new NFL news lately?
I have! Did you hear about Colin Kaepernick remaining a free agent?
That is crazy! I wonder what Joe Montana is going to do about it.
He doesn't seem very thrilled and optimistic that Joe will find a new home in the NFL.
Why would he say that?
He thinks that they are just not getting along very well and Joe had plenty of issues for being a minority.
That's too bad.
I know, he visited the Seattle Seahawks last May but I heard they signed someone else.
Oh I heard about that. The Seahawks signed Austin Davis instead.
That's so unfortunate for him.
Have you heard of the latest news with Sam Darnold?
Oh no I didn't, what's up?
He thinks that the NFL teams shouldn't sacrifice an entire campaign because of him.
That's right because as a redshirt sophomore, he can apply for entry to the 2018 NFL Draft after this upcoming season.
Good point. He really isn't allowing anyone to change his point of view.
True, he said that his play, along with conversations with his family and coaches as the main factors for whether he decides to go pro as a redshirt sophomore.
He seems like a very reasonable player.
I agree, he has a good head on his shoulders.
He isn't letting the spotlight affect his persona at all.
I think we need more players like him in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man do you think they will still be going on about Deflate-Gate this year.
I hope so it seemed to unify the Patriots.
That's a team you don't want to give an edge to.
I think Brady didn't say much but he had a chip on his shoulder all season for the last couple of years.
He didn't need any extra motivation but they gave it to him.
Yeah when they talk trash about you you feel the need to prove them wrong.
And do the talking on the field and not with your mouth.
Bellecheck is pretty good at keeping his guys quiet when stuff like that happens
Yeah, his players that don't know that are soon playing for some other team.
Yeah and if he really gets mad maybe he'll trade you to Cleavland
Yeah I wonder how Jamie Collins likes playing for the worst team in the leauge
Should have kept his mouth shut instead of complaining to the media.
I hear rumors that Cleveland wants to trade New England for Jimmy Garoppolo.
I heard that too on ESPN I think.
I think Bellecheck will keep him though.
In this league you always need a class second stringer in case of injury.
They could franchise tag him this year see what happens and trade him next off season
That would be smart.  I bet that's what they do.
I hope so he's good enough to start for most of the other teams.
And he lasted longer in the league than Johnny Football.  I mean Johnny Manzel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
How's it going
Just watching the pro bowl
How is it
The one team has poor offense
Hm?
Yeah it's as if they aren't trying
Well dang
I know right
How is the other team
They are ace
Good offense ?
Better but not the best
Chill
Yeah it is
Any point asking about defense
You know the answer
No?
Pretty much
Yeah I guessed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many NFL games have you attended in your life?
Oh. Quite a few, you know me and my dad have been going to see the Bengals play since I was just a kid.
Are they your favorite team or is it just because you live in Cincinnati
Its pretty much because I live there. Though I have gone to see a few games with uh.. the  Miami Dolphins
Do you like the Dolphins?
They are okay, Ryan Tannehill could improve just a little. How many NFL games have you attended
In my whole life? I guess maybe twenty but the most memorable ones were the playoffs.
Who did you see in the playoffs?
The New York Jets.
What year was this ?
I think it was 2010. No they didn't win but the game was interesting
Who is the star quarterback for the Jets this year?
Probably Josh McCown I hear he's signed with them
What about Christian Hackenberg, his stats seem pretty good
Yeah but he's not the best. Sorry.
Yeah there's always gonna be a younger much better, player than him. So you say it's Josh McCown?
Clearly. But we will see when the season starts
Yeah we will see.
Well next time your in New York we will catch a Jets game
The Jets? I hate them......
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready to watch Von Miller.
yeah but I read an article he is coming for someone.
what do you mean?
You didn't hear about it?
No what was it?
He was talking about the falcons player.
You do not remember his name?
Vic Beasley, he is a falcons pass rusher.
oh wow I did not hear about that.
Yeah con miller is good as people say.
what position does he hold in the nfl
he holds position number two in the league.
wow that is amazing.
the broncos have a good one on their hands.
yeah von miller is unstoppable for the most part.
I agree. he is amazing.
He is definitely one of the best in NFL.
I like how others try so hard to beat him though.
it helps them want to do better.
I agree it makes the other players play harder.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The football season is coming up.
Right; it's been a long time.
Can you believe that Super Bowl? It was the best ever!
Right; I almost missed it. And that Lady Gaga jumped off the bleeping roof at halftime; that had to be the best halftime show too.
It was choice when Roger Goodell got booed handing out the trophy.
That's what he gets. He was just a chauffer for that other guy.
Yeah, I bet he can't even go out to dinner in public with his wife.
If he has one!
You think they will do it again?
I don't know; I mean all Atlanta had to do was run the ball at the end and they would have won.
Right, but they didn't have Gronk or that other guy.
Whatever, I mean I wouldn't bet against it.
Have to check the schedule anyway. Maybe it is easy.
Doesn't matter. You can just pencil them into the playoffs, and everyone knows it.
It would help if Philly or New York were any good.
Man, that Eli is a train wreck.
He got it done twice.
Yeah, even Joe Namath didn't do that!
You're crazy, man!
Don't forget about Romo!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Patriots as an organization?
I love their consistency, but I hate their individual parts.
Yes, I think many people share your view.
I think it would be hard not to see that they are great, but that they steal and cheat to get results.
Do you think Bill Belichick is the greatest coach of all time?
Probably, but I still don't like him.
Do you think that Tom Brady is the best quarterback ever?
Again, he most likely is, but I feel disappointed that he is.
I get what you're saying about being impressed by them, but still feeling let down by them.
It shouldn't be this way, and I should be enjoying their dominance and impressive control of the league for years.
They kind of make it hard to cheer for them.
Yes, and they are boring with how they win.
Well I think a win is a win, and ugly football still wins championships.
No doubt, and some football purists would call their gameplan genius.
So when do you think they will fall as a dynasty?
That's easy, whenever Belichick or Brady retires.
So no one else could fill their shoes?
No, they have a perfect fit and understanding of each other, and no one else could be on the same page as them.
What if they drafted a great quarterback that turned into the next Tom Brady?
That would be a nightmare for the league, and we would be stuck with more Patriot winning for the next two decades.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you getting the NFL channel this year again?
Of course, I don't want to miss good games.
Are you still Seahawks fan?
Yup, always!
Russell Wilson's good, but I think my team will beat you this season!
No way! Your QB's getting old.
Ouch! That's true though, unfortunately...
And I thought Larry is retiring.
No, he'll play another season. He can still play good.
I don't know...he's getting up there, too.
Sadly, yeah. We will be needing new QB and receivers...
You guys need a whole new team!
Nah, you saw David Johnson. He's young and super talented.
What position does he play?
He's a running back.
Oh, yeah, now I remember. Yeah, he is good.
Right? Besides we still have decent defense.
Still Seahawks will beat the Cards, for sure.
As long as the Patriots doesn't win I don't care.
Ugh! I know, I'm sick of them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just read that the NFL cheerleaders only get paid $150 per game.
Seriously?
Yup, that's crazy.
$150 per day? I'll take that.
It's a really small amount of money. Times that by 16 games and it's barely above $2000, pre-tax.
Multiply.
Huh?
Times is not a verb. Multiply is.
Oh shut up. What do you think about the wages?
I think they're completely fair yet unfair.
Like how?
It's fair because no one notices the cheerleaders anyway. They are paid $150 to look pretty.
Yeah they don't lead cheers, do they?
I know they put a ton of time into it, and I think they have to pay for their own uniforms, too.
Do you have a solution?
Of course! I am wise beyond your years.
Tell me.
Pay them $1,000 per game. That's $16,000 per year.
That's a lot!
Pay the concessions people the same, too. It's nothing when compared to the insanely overpaid players. $1 million less from the team salary is unnoticeable, but would greatly improve others' llives.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team?
Mine is the Clemson Tigers.  My son went to school there.
Where is Clemson?
It's in South Carolina.  Their rivals are the South Carolina Gamecocks
I think I've seen them play before.  What are their colors?
Purple and orange and their mascot is a tiger.  Their coach right now is Dabo Swinney.
Why are they your favorite team?
They have a really strong defensive line.  Martin Aiken is really talented.
Are they playing Kent State for their first game?
Yes they are.  The game is September 2.  It's at the Clemson Memorial Stadium and I have tickets.
That should be a good game.  When do they play Florida State?
On November 11th.
Florida State is my favorite team.
Really?  Why do you like them so much?
I think they have a great offensive line.  The new quarterback Deondre Francois is going to do well this year.
I still don't think they can beat Clemson.
They had a bad year last year but I'm really looking for them to pull it back.
Their defense is terrible though.
Derwin James is back from his injury this season though so I expect that to improve.
We'll have to see how wins the Atlantic Coast Conference
XXXXXXXXXXX
The 2017 season is almost here
Yea, pre-season camps open in a few weeks
So what teams do you think will finish at the top?
I think Green Bay , New England  and Atlanta are the favorites
What about surprise teams ?
Minnesota , Dallas , KC and Oakland
I hope it's not New England  again it's kind of getting old.
Yea it would be fun to see a few new teams breakout in 2017
What's you favorite team?
I'm a huge Giants fan
Oh wow I love the Vikings were  rivals
Vikings should be pretty good
Yea, I feel like Minnesota and the Giants are in about the same place  with their teams
I think 1 or both could make the playoffs but neither is built to go really far
Agreed, It would be nice just to get back to the playoffs
Yes making the playoffs make the season feel like it wasn't a complete waste
So do you get to many games?
Maybe 1 or 2 a season
Nice I don't get to many games but I watch every Viking game on TV
Wow,  great and good luck in 2017 to your vikings
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey when does the NFL pre-season start this year?
The first week of August.
Ok, That is good to know.
Who are you rooting for this year?
The same team I root for every year, the Chicago Bears.
Ha Ha. You do that. I don't see them doing anything this year.
Really, every team has a chance to go to the superbowl.
Yeah, but last year Chicago team only 3 times.
I know, you don't have to remind me.  I'm just one of those loyal fans
There's nothing wrong with that.
What team are you interested in this year?
I like the New Orleans Saints.
They didn't do too bad last year.  I think they finished the season 7-9.
That's right, they finished the last three seasons 7-9.
That's crazy, isn't it?
Yeah. I hear 2017 can be good for them, they have some pretty good draft picks.
Oh yeah, like who?
Can't recall the names, but I know the positions involved cornerback, safety, linebacker and a running back.
Well hopefully they are an asset to the team.
Yes. It would be nice to see the get to the Superbowl this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake?
Jaguars, they gotta be getting paid. Of course they're being paid, who would cheer for the Jaguars for free?
Jeff Fisher was fired
I know, he was one loss away from having the all time most losses record
The Cleveland Browns have been eliminated from playoff contention
You know what, it took us 0-11 to get here so the rest of the AFC North should be ashamed of themselves.
StubHub sent me last years playoff tickets.
Contact the stadium and see if they can verify that the ticket number is last year's.
Demaryius Thomas or Dez Bryant? Whose the better 88?
If given the same QB I would take Thomas all day.
Is it ever possible for an NFL team to get as stacked as the Warriors are right now in the NBA?
It's possible, but very unlikely. The top players are worth too much. We have salary caps to prevent stuff like this.
Do Linemen like their quarterbacks?
Only if their name isn't RG3. On a serious note, QBs typically get their lineman pretty nice gifts. Tyrod got his lineman big TVs last season and Flacco got his Oculus Rifts.
Who retired at the right time of their career?
Ray Lewis, Dude essentially bookended his career with Raven SB victories. Great way to end a career.
If your current team did not exist, which team would you root for?
The Browns, just moved to Cleveland a few years back and absolutely love everything about the City.
What team seems to always find a way to beat your team, no matter the circumstances?
We usually split the series but those damn Rams man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the worst NFL team?
Probably the Browns or the Jets.
I would agree with the Jets for sure.
They just don't have a lot of talent.
No, hardly any at all.
I think it would be a shock if they win three games.
That is about what I would think too.
They had a pretty bad draft too.
I think the Browns draft was slightly better than the Jets.
I do too.
That is why I agreed with the Jets.
The Browns have some struggles ahead of them too.
I don't think they will win five games.
It would be a shocker to me.
It must be tough to be bad every year.
That is how it has seemed for them the past few years.
Hopefully they can turn it around eventually.
It would be nice to see the Browns be competitive.
It would.
Makes for better games to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the Steelers begin their dominance in the NFL
I would say 1974.
Why do you say that?
That's when they went to their first Super Bowl
Oh in 1974?
Well it was in 1975, but for the 1974 season
Oh that's right. They always play in the new year.
Yes.
Who did they play that year?
Vikings.
Oh geez, so the Vikings lost a bunch in the 70s.
Yes, yes they did.
That Steelers team was stacked
Yes, a lot of Hall of Famers
Yeah, I remember Franco Harris back then
Yes, he was the Super Bowl MVP
Yeah, back in the glory days of running backs.
Yeah, it's all about QBs now.
Yeah and receivers.
Yeah and tight ends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You a fan of the Cincinnati Bengals?
Not really. I've been in Cincinnati for over 4 years, but haven't followed them much
Are there die hard fans in Cincinnati?
Some fans are, but they tend to be more fair weathered than anything else.
Are the Bengals any good?
They've had their moments recently. Made play-offs five years in a row.
Wow, that's really good.
Yeah, but they've lost in the first round each year.
Who's their coach.
Marvin Lewis. Longest tenured coach after Belicheck.
Wow, the team ownership must like him.
Yeah, they're pretty cheap too.
Did they ever make it to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, back in the 80s. Lost to the 49ers both times.
Wow, that must've been hard for the fans.
Yeah, just can't win the big one.
I like their uniforms.
Can't say I'm a fan. Too busy for my taste.
I really like the orange and black.
Looks like a Halloween costume to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, I used to love the Minnesota Vikings.
You don't anymore?
I still do. But I did more as a kid.
What's changed?
Well, I don't live in Minnesota anymore. So there's that.
Right. It's harder to see games.
There are a couple bars that play them, but not many people to watch with.
That's too bad.
And then I feel like I should root for the Giants, since I live here in New York now.
It might be more fun, but I don't see any reason you'd need to.
Well, I can't just secretly root for the Vikings. I like to go all out when I'm cheering.
What sorts of things do you do?
Well, I like to wear a jersey.
And a purple one would really stand out when everyone else is wearing blue.
Exactly. And I like to get loud and cheer.
So does everyone!
I guess that's true.
Yeah. Have more confidence, come in a jersey and root for the Vikings.
Maybe I will.
You should!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you looking forward to most about this NFL year?
I want to see if the Falcons will bounce back after last year's loss.
Oh yeah that was wild. i wonder if that tore them apart.
I think they'll be good, but not as good.
yeah they are in a tough division.
I think the Steelers and Raiders could make some noise.
Oh yeah I'm amazed how much money Derek carr got on his new contract.
yeah if only he could play every game in warm weather though. He's so bad in the cold.
I wonder who else will be good.
Maybe the Chiefs or Broncos.
What about some NFC teams?
I think the Giants may bounce back this year.
They always have a chance with Eli Manning.
What about the Saints?
I think they can score with Brees but they don't play much defense.
Defense wins championships for sure.
What rookie is going to be good?
I think McCaffey down in Carolina will be good.
Oh yeah he'll help them a lot.
yeah they need someone to help Cam newton.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This is the year for Andrew Luck.
Do you really think so?
Yes, he is a great quarterback, and he will lead the Colts to the Super Bowl.
Wow, that's a bold prediction for a mediocre team.
That's just how good I think Andrew Luck is.
So he will put the team on his back and carry them through the playoffs?
Yes, and he's been close a couple times before in his short career.
I actually agree with you that he is a top-notch passer.
He's my favorite player, and he's durable and tough.
I followed him a lot more when he was in college at Stanford.
Oh yeah, he was the man when he was in college.
It was crazy how good Stanford was with Luck and Harbaugh there.
Oh yeah, I forgot that Jim Harbaugh coached them for awhile.
Yes, and then he went to the NFL to coach San Francisco, and now he's back in college at Michigan.
That's funny how things change so quickly for coaches and players in sports.
You have to be very willing to move and adapt if you play or coach.
I don't know if I could move my family around that much.
Yes, it must be hard if you have young kids.
I guess that's one of the reasons that these guys get paid big money.
You really have to be committed and love the game in order to uproot your life like that.

What NFL team will have the best regular season record this year?
Hard not to go with the Patriots, right?
I'm not so sure, this year.
Why not?
Well, for one thing, I think the Dolphins might be a good team this year.
If their division gets more challenging, that will make it tougher for them to roll through the regular season, true.
Also, at SOME point Tom Brady's age will catch up to him.
Hasn't happened yet! The dude just won the Super Bowl.
But eventually, it will happen. Maybe through injuries.
Eventually, you'll be right about Brady, but I wouldn't bet on it this year.
I think the Seahawks have a really good chance to have the best record.
Hmm, I think they'll be good, but why do you say best record?
First of all, they have the best home field advantage in the league.
Yep, no better home field advantage.
Second, I think their division is soft.
You're not a believer in the Cardinals?
I'm not sold on their QB situation, and I think both the Rams and the 49ers will be bad.
If all three teams are mediocre to bad, then Seattle should have a great record.
Yeah, that's just how I see it falling out this year.
I hope it's not another Seattle/New England Super Bowl. I want some new talent!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you want to chat about football?
Sure i like to watch football but usually only the superbowl.
What team do you like?
I like the Giants.
Ahh, my team is the falcons.
I dont care for the falcons.
Well the feeling is mutual i dont like the giants.
Who is your favorite player?
I like Randy moss but he's retired.
I like brandon jacobs but he's also retired.
Who else do you like?
Tiki barber was a good one.
That he was.
I also like jerry rice, hes like the original randy moss.
Thats true.
How about quarterbacks?
Tom brady for sure.
yeah, i do believe him to be the best.
It was nice talking to you.
You as well. have a good day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Steelers for this year?
Ugh, I am kind of worried.
I think they did well on the draft with Watt.
For sure. They addressed the needs there well.
I think some of the free agent stuff was dubious though.
I disagree. I think some of the new signings were solid, the released the right people
I guess we will see.
The only thing I am worried about is lack of depth
No kidding.
I am not entirely sure what to do if our starters go down.
What about Ben?
I know. They still haven't figured out the QB situation.
I think they need to draft one regardless next year
I know me too.
Take a risk/flier on someone
Getting career backups isn't going to solve the problem
I agree. And then we have the issue of the WR's
I think there is a good group they just need more time and reps
I think that could be said about the entire team
Valid point
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Steve Young?
The football player?
Yeah, the quarterback.
Oh, yeah.  He was awesome when he played for the 49er.
Yeah, they had a great team back then.
Steve Young and Jerry Rice were awesome.
They won a couple of superbowls, right?
They were really good in the 90s, but I think they only won one.
Oh, wow.  I guess that's not surprising though.
Yeah, they might have had a better record and still not won that one game.
Yeah.  Did Steve Young play for any other teams after the 49ers?
I'm not sure, but he didn't play for any after the 49ers.
Wow, and he played for them for a while.
Yeah, he was with them for over ten years.
At least ten.  Probably close to fifteen.
He's in the Hall of Fame, isn't he?
Oh, I'm sure he is.  He is in the collegiate hall of fame for sure.
Where did he go to college?
Brigham Young University.
Oh, that's the one in Utah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, could you teach me about football?
Sure, what do you want to know? Offense or Defense?
I'd like to learn about offense.
Ok, offense it is. I'm sure you know what the quarterback does right?
Kind of, he throws the ball right?
Well, kind of. The quarterback is basically in charge of the field. He decides the plays.
Oh ok, so he tells everybody else what to do.
Right, so he might throw the ball to someone, or he might run the ball himself or hand it off to another player. It all depends on the play.
Ok I get it. The quarterback is the general and the other players are his soldiers.
Exactly. Next we have the running back . This is usually a really fast player that can do everything. Run, block, whatever.
So, he's like a second quarterback?
Well, no, because he doesn't call the play. Remember, the quarterback decides on the play.
Oh ok, but after the play is decided, the running back is pretty important?
Yea, absolutely.
Ok, got it. What else?
Well, then we have a fullback, which is like a runningback, but normally stronger. The fullback does a lot of blocking and protecting.
Oh ok so like a buff version of the runningback.
Yea, kind of. Which is crazy because they are all so buff already.
Yea no kidding. This sounds complicated.
It's easy once you start watching games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, that's a classic Niners shirt!
It sure is. I'm a second generation fan.
I got to see a few games in 95, nothing like it.
So you got to see Deion Sanders fly around the field?
That was unbelievable! I bought a shirt there that said "Deion does Dallas"
I saw those shirts. Our family has had season tickets forever. How about Jerry Rice?
I swear he was like an acrobat and ballet dancer on that field.
He was also an Olympic sprinter and World Series outfielder too.
My friend's uncle went on a cruise and we got to use his season's tickets.
it was the best show in town, with the best audience anywhere before they moved the stadium to yuppieville.
I know, what a tragedy. Have you been to the new stadium?
I refuse to go. A friend of mine hosts a great tailgate party on a lake every Sunday.
The home television situation has come a long way lately. Better screens and more access to games.
Yeah. I get the NFL package on direct TV, what about you?
Same although I would like to see some healthy competion. I don't like them as a cable provider.
Right? I would wager that more than half of their business is made up of football fans.
I assume you saw that game where Steve Young threw the ball and then caught it himself?
That was sweet.  It's a shame that he played through so much injury.
The live game experience is just not what it used to be.
I will travel to see an out of town game now before a home game. The fans were betrayed here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest QB ever.
Brady. Hands down.
What about montana
Was the best. Not anymore.
Why do you think brady is better.
5 super bowl wins.
well that is good
the best
montana didn't lose any
And didn't get to as many
That's true
Plus Brady did it with different talent around him all the time
True
Montana had the same talent
You're on point today
Plus montana got old at the end of his career
that he did
Brady is playing at a high level at his age
I still think montana is better
You're still wrong
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about football
Great i love football
Me too
My favorite team is the colts
They are good
Do you remember their head coaches name?
No
Its chuck pagano
Oh, thats right
I love their quarterback
Andrew luck?
Yea he is good
Jack doyle is a good tight end too
Yes he is
I like watching him
Me too
They are overall a pretty good team
Yes they are
Good talking to you
You too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the upcoming football season?
I think it's gonna be pretty exciting.
What are you most excited about?
Well, since I'm a 49ers fan, I'm curious to see how their revamped coaching staffe and personel will do.
Yeah, I suppose. But aren't they still rebuilding?
Yeah, but I think they might actually be improved regardless. It'll be cool to see if they made some good steps forward.
Who do you think will make it out of the NFC?
I still think the Atlanta Falcons are the best team in the NFC.
So you don't think the Cowboys have a shot?
No way. Teams have had an off season to watch tape on Dak Prescott now.
That is true. Who do you think is coming out of the AFC?
I think it's actually gonna be surprising this year. I can totally see the Raiders going to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, they were pretty good last year. And who knows what would have happened had Carr not gotten hurt.
Exactly. I think that it's possible that they go all the way to the Super Bowl.
Do you think they could beat the Falcons?
Yeah, I do. Who do you think is winning the Super Bowl?
I think that the Atlanta Falcons will probably win it.
That's a safe bet to take I suppose. Do you want to bet on it.
I don't bet. I'm just eager for the season to start since I love football.
Yeah, me too. I can't wait for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you ready for some football?
Oh yeah. Counting down the weeks until I can see my team in action.
What team is that?
The Colts who have made it to the superbowl twice.
Ha ha, and how long ago was that?
Ok brace yourself, 1971 and 2007.
Wow, that is like a decade ago.
You're not lying, but anything can happen with some new players.
Your right. I see they drafted a few safetys and cornerback.
Hopefully the can bring some talent to the team and end with a great Season.
Hey do you remember what year Peyton manning stopped playing with the Colts?
I believe it was in 2011.
Ok, then he went and played with Denver Broncos, right?
Yeah, in 2012 he went and played for the Broncos.
I know he retired sometime after that.
That retirement occurred sometime in 2016.
Ok, so basically Peyton spent 14 seasons with the Colts and then ended his career with the Broncos.
Right. And don't forget He won his last Superbowl the same year he retired.
I remember now, he didn't say he was going to disney. He was going to drink beer.
Ha Ha, he said "I’m going to take a lot of beer tonight.”
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you know football season is coming up?
Yeah, I can't wait for it!
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Atlanta Falcons, they are a good team!
I also like the Atlanta Falcons but my favorite team is Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
I like the bucs a lot as well. I think John Gruden was their best coach.
I agree. He was the best by far.
What do you think of the Patriots?
I'm sick of seeing the always win. I want my team to get to the super bowl.
Yeah but maybe the reason they always win is because they are very good.
That could be why, but Id still like my team to have a chance at winning a superbowl.
Yes I agree. I too would like an under dog team to win it this year.
I hope that this season is full of twists and turns and exciting plays.
Oh im sure it will be exciting.
Yes but, I mean REALLY exciting. Like record breakers.
Oh I see what you mean. Yes that would be cool.
Do you know the farthest fieldgoal in the NFL history?
No, I do not.
Well I sure hope my team does good this season.
I hope both our teams do well!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL football?
Of course. Football is my favorite sport.
I love the touchdown celebrations.
They get more creative every year.
I wonder who will show out this season. Cam Newton has been on it lately.
Cam has put dances on the map.
The NFL is cracking down on excessive celebrations.
I think they are entertaining and can fire a team up.
The CFL is different than the NFL. They are lenient and let multiple players celebrate.
The NFL should encourage it. It helps with ratings.
The spike was the first touchdown celebration.
Who invented it?
Honer Jones way back in 1965.
You know the Redskins were the first to perform group high-fives.
I did not know that. These celebrations are so common today.
I use to love when Aaron Rodgers did the championship belt moves.
That was cool. When they won the Superbowl he was given a big championship belt.
Rodgers was able to turn that into a commercial with State Farm.
I wonder what the hot celebration dance will be this year.
There is no telling. Players get more creative every season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The year the Jets make the Superbowl is almost here.
Not even in your dreams I'm afraid.
No need to rub it in. You know I'm just kidding.
The Jets are looking to be legitimately one of the worst teams this year.
I read that some executives stated that they may be fielding one of the worst teams in recent history.
That team could legitimately go 0-16.
That 0-16 Lions team was not that bad at all. They just ran into some serious bad luck.
I agree. They were a lot better than this upcoming Jets team is
I'm scared about the quarterbacking situation. We seem so lost.
Who even is on the roster? Hackenberg and Petty?
I think so. I don't even know who our third quarterback is. Assuming we have one.
That's pretty unsettling to have those two as your top quarterbacks.
I haven't heard very much that was good about Hacky.
Last I heard he was apparently so inaccurate that he was pelting reporters in the back on accident.
I heard about that story to. I really wanted to hope it was a joke.
They always said he was a huge project. It's showing.
It grows tiresome that we seemingly keep drafting projects. I want prospects, not projects.
What's the difference?
Projects can take years to develop. Time you don't have. Prospects can contribute instantly.
Oh so basically someone like Tebow was a project, while someone like Newton would be a prospect. I understand.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Uncle Lenny I am free today did you want to hang?
Most definitely Brandon I am setting up for the football game tonight.
Cool, are you guys playing or just watching?
We can play a bit in the backyard but we were just gonna watch.
Which game is on tonight?
I think we got the Redskins and the Vikings.
Two good old school offensive teams, I'll definitely be there!
Great, and yeah it should be a high scoring beast of a game.
Did you hear the Redskins want to keep Kirk Cousins?
I heard that but he is an expensive guy, we will see what happens to the team.
I think the GM would make a mistake in recommending letting him go.
He is one of the best quarterbacks in the league that is for sure!
Not only that, he is a vital QB on a team that really needs a ring.
I think the West in general could use a ring, instead of those Pats!
I would love a ring, and I'd love for a team from the West to snag it.
Come on through when you are available, I actually have a Cousins jersey.
Nice, I actually just bought an Antoine Boldin jersey for cheap, when he was on the Cardinals.
Great buy, I want to see it!
I'll be over to show it soon!
I'll be waiting for ya!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to talk about nfl
Yes
Its my favorite
Mine too
I want to a vikings game last year?
Was it amazing?
It was so amazing
I havent beem to a game
I want to go to another one
I really want to go to one
You should, its amazing
Im hooked now
It would be awesome togo to the superbowl
It would
Then you would miss out on all the commercials
Thats true
It might be worth it though
I think it would definitely be worth it
I bet next years is already sold out
Probably
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about the lions?
I like the detroit lions
They are alright
I like their mascot

He is
Who is the owner
Martha firestone ford
Oh alright
She seems nice
She sounds it
I like the coach too
Who is that?
Jim caldwell
Oh okay
He is pretty good
Thats good
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
i just saw the highlights from Superbowl XXI
Who played in that one?
Denver Broncos versus the New York Giants.
Who were the quarterbacks?
John Elway for the Broncos and Phil Simms for the Giants.
Who were the coaches?
Dan Reeves for the Broncos and and Bill Parcells for the Giants.
Who were the broadcasters?
Pat Summerall and John Madden.
Where was it played?
The Rose Bowl.
Who scored first?
Denver, field goal by Rich Karlis.
What was the score after one?
Denver, 10-7.
At the half?
10-9, Denver.
What happened in the rest of the game?
The Giants scored 30 unanswered points to win 39-20.
Wow a blowout in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best QB Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers?
Tom Brady all the way because he won more Superbowl championships.
No I think Aaron Rodgers is the best because he is a great QB.
But Tom Brady was at  #12 and he is Patriotic.
Aaron Rodgers was also #12 on the chart as well.
Tom Brady has better mechanics that Aaron Rodgers.
Yes I can give credit when its due. Tom Brady has won more superbowls.
Brady also have more passing guards of completion than Rodgers.
But Brady is a cheat he deflated the balls so the Patriots can win the game.
But the suspension was thrown out.
Besides Aaron Rodgers only needs 3 more TD to become # 11.
Brady has thrown more touchdowns to more players than anyone short of Vinny Testaverde.
Rodger is the most well-rounded quarterback in the history of the game. Brady lacks of mobility.
Brady has maintained the same performance level throughout his career with a multitude of different players at skill positions
Rodgers teams are 0-35 when trailing against teams in the fourth quarter by more than one point that have a winning record.
Aside from the volume stats, Brady outperformed Rodgers in most every important quarterback stat last season
Brady probably gets the edge here but, Rodgers’ game is more based on his talents and ability.
Taking into account that Brady played the first portion of his career in an era with more physicality on the defensive side.
Rodgers throws better, more mobile, bigger arm, more accurate, more touchdowns, fewer interceptions…and does it with a worse team
When Brady’s teams give up more than 21 points, he has a career record of 66-50… by far better than any quarterback in history.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You about ready for nfl football?
Yep. I've got my fantasy team ready to go.
AWESOME! who's your qb?
Tom Brady all the way!!
Solid pick. I've got russel Wilson from the Seahawks
That seems like an odd choice I don't hear much about him.
Well he passed for over 4000 yards last season with 21 touchdowns.
Ok. Wow seems like a solid choice. Brady threw for 3500 but had more touchdowns.
Yeah no doubt he's good but I just didn't want to pick the obvious choice again.
Again who did you have last year?
Aaron Rodgers. 4400 yards and 40 tds.
Wow. And your not happy with that.
No. Plenty happy just going a different route.
I got ya. Just trying to mix it up a bit. So what wide reciver did you go with?
Julio jones from the Falcons. You?
Odell beckham jr from the Giants.
Do you have something for the northeast teams?
Not in particular. They are just good!
Well I hope you do well this year!
Yeah you too.  Well not too good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the National Football League?
Yes, yes I am.
Did you watch the Draft?
Yes, I watched the Draft.
Who did your favorite team get?
They drafted Tre'Davious White.
What position does he play?
He played cornerback in college.
Did he play for LSU?
Yes, I believe so. My team got that pick in a trade.
Was it a good trade?
I believe so. They got it from Kansas City.
Is Alex still with the Chiefs?
Yes, Alex smith? I believe so.
He must be getting old now. I mean, he's been there for years.
Yes, he's old. He's at least in his thirties.
I wouldn't have guessed. Is the old Eagles' coach still there?
Yes. Why haven't they been to the playoffs yet?
I don't know. Maybe the coach forgot how to win.
That's a strong possibility. Or Smith is just too old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey can you smell that? It's in the air Fall is almost here and Football is in the air...Can you feel it?
Oh yeah, I can feel it, the NFL train is near, all day Sunday, Sunday Night, Monday Night and don't forget Thursday's.
I love it all also. What is your favorite night?
Monday Nights.
Really?
Yes, there is just something about continuing football from Sunday to Monday. I think the NFL got it right this time.
What do you think about the signature songs for these nights?
they're really cool, I look forward to who's singing the new song every season.
Do you know which teams will be playing the first Monday night game?
I am not sure, I need to check my NFL schedule.
Are there any rookie players your looking forward to watching?
I want to see what the rookie Running Back James Conner drafted by the Steelers heard he was a beast in college.
I'll keep an eye out for him. They also have a new quarterback Dobbs?
Yeah, he has a great arm they could use a replacement I think Ben is getting old and slow.
Boy, I would love to see the Steelers win another SuperBowl.
If the rookie can show up Ben then they may get to the playoffs, not the Superbowl.
Wishing thinking on my part, but the NFL is so unpredictable at times.
You are right teams that made it to the playoff one year may not make it back there for years.
I love me some football, there's nothing better than the NFL..
You could not have said it better...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite NFL team?
I love the Green Bay Packers.
Why do you like them? You can't even see them in their stadium.
Well, if I live to be 200 years old, maybe!
Don't you like any other teams?
Well, I like the New England Patriots.
They win a lot, but are they fair?
Well, I think deflategate was overrated.
Do you like Tom Brady?
I think he's one of the best athletes the NFL has ever had.
But don't you think that he and the patriots are choking out other teams?
No, I don't think so. They're just good.
What about a team out west?
Well, I think the Denver Broncos are good.
Do you think they will have a chance after Manning?
I think they're still a good team in spite of him leaving.
Which teams will go to the Super Bowl next year?
Probably the Patriots and some team we don't know about.
Are you sure the Patriots will make it?
Not completely, but they're the first team that comes up in my mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Teddy Bridgewater will be back for the Vikings this year?
No I thinkl they will do the smart thing and keep him out for another year
So do you think Bradford can lead them into the playoffs
He started out well last year but the rest of the league caught up with the Vikings pretty quickly.
Yeah, and they don't have Peterson anymore
I think Peterson was overrated and they relied on him too much.  He was a great player but he never really led the team
I agree.  It reminded me a lot of Randy Moss from the old days.  He seemed more important than he was.
Besides it is time to get some new looks to the offense and the defense.
What do you think of Zimmer as a whole
I think he is the best coach they have had for a while, but since that is the case he is also overrated because he looks good in comparison to what they have had
I don't agree, I think Zimmer has some good ideas and can inspire the team.
This is the Vikings we are talking about you know, one of the most snakebit teams in the NFL.
Yeah, but it could be worse, we could be Buffalo Bills fans
Anyway, thedy have to get their receiving corps to be more relevant.  Treadway has to step up and Floyd needs to at least perform.
The young defensive players have to start shaping up this year as we lost some really good veterans.
Well, camp starts in a couple of weeks so it won't be much longer before we see what is happening
Are you planning on attending this year?
Not this year, too much to do at work, I will follow the Twitter feeds and the KFAN reports
I think I will head down there for one of the weekends.
Sounds like fun!  Let me know how it went and what you saw.  See you later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best team to never win a Super Bowl.
Definitely the 1998 Minnesota Vikings.
That's what comes to my mind as well. The 1999 Jacksonville Jaguars come to mind as well.
And the 2007 New England Patriots.
Yeah, I forgot all about New England. They've won so much, that I don't really think about them in this category.
True. The 1998 Minnesota Vikings were destined to win and then something happened.
Yeah, Gary Anderson happened.
The dude was perfect all year and missed the biggest kick in Vikings history.
He probably can't sleep till this day. It was only a 40 yarder, in the dome.
So much talent wasted on not winning the Super Bowl. Cunningham, Randy Moss, Cris Carter, Robert Smith. That offense was ridiculous.
Ridiculous was right. Everyone wanted to see the Vikings and Broncos in that Super Bowl.
Everyone, including me. What could have been.
I wonder if Minnesota could have beaten Denver.
They would have put up a better showing than Atlanta. You mentioned the 1999 Jaguars. What happened with them.
They went 14-0 against everyone in the league except the Titans. They went 0-3 against them.
Oh, the Music City Miracle titans. Yes.
They had a pretty solid offense and defense.
I'm trying to think. Brunnell, Fred Taylor, Jimmy Smith.
Yes. Quite a balanced offense. The defense wasn't too bad either.
At least the Titans gave us one of the best Super Bowls that year against the Rams. So, not so disappointed Jacksonville didn't make it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
EJ just got picked by the Bills.
I heard they grabbed him in the first round.
I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno.
I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field.
Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?
I can't imagine.
You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round.
Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them.
Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get.
They got EJ for 6 years.
Wait, Manuel is going to be stuck with the Bills for six years?
That's what they signed him for.
Ej's not evne that bad. Six years with the Bills is more of a punishment.
He is young enough that he can still come out on top.
That's true, but I still think they overpaid for him.
I was thinking that too, but he's all the Bill's got
That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie.
They probably just wanted to get the ticket sales. Buffalo doesn't really support the Bills that way you think they would.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for football?
Yes!
It is my favorite season of the year.
Mine too.
It seems like it takes forever.
I really want to go to an NFL game.
Me too.
We should see if they have any tickets.
We probably have to go to the NFL site and order them.
I want to see all the new players the COlts have.
I want to see them all.
TY Hilton is my favorite.
He is good.
He has broken many records.
I want to get his autograph.
I wish I could see Peyton Manning.
Maybe one day you will.
I hope so.
His brother still plays.
Yes for the Giants.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the worst NFL player right now?
You mean in the history of the game or currently?
I'd go for currently.
I'd say maybe JaMarcus Russell.
The quaterback?
Yeah I think he's the worst player statistically speaking.
Why do you say it's Russell?
He was suppose to be this awesome young talent when he got drafted.
So what happened.
He just flopped.
Flopped?
Yeah his three year stint with the raiders ended up being a complete waste for the organization. They got nothing out of him.
What do you think the cause of that was just bad luck?
No he had terrible work ethic.
Give me some examples.
Well he came to practice out of shape and overweight, was the last guy to show up for work and the first to go home.
Wow that is a horrid work ethic.
It really showed on the feild man. He was a disaster.
What ever happened to him?
He no longer plays for the NFL. No team wanted him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best move this off season?
I think Marshawn Lynch coming back and going to the Raiders is a big deal.
Really, he is kind of up there in age, I don't know how productive he will be.
He should do well, he took time off after all.
I see, so you're saying he should be rejuvenated for the coming season.
Yes, I think he has taken the time to get healthy.
I really also want to see how Adrian Peterson does on the Saints.
Yes I wonder if he can have a good season, the Saints are an explosive offense.
Yes, if he can play the whole season I think he will perform well.
Speaking of a former Viking, how well do you think Minnesota will be.
Good question, I think they will miss the playoffs because the Packers and Lions will both be good.
Yes, I agree with that, it will be tough to win that division this year.
Well at least they have a good young core.
Yup, they just need to find that franchise quarterback to lead them to the promised land.
I do wonder though how the Vikings will be without Adrian Peterson, it's kind of crazy not seeing him in that uniform.
Well I don't think they were on the best terms, it will be strange if they Saints and Vikings play for sure.
Yes that is true.
Well hopefully he can earn me some Fantasy points as a dark horse, I am willing to bet on Peterson.
Good luck, that can payoff if he goes off for some good numbers.
Yup, well either way this season's going to be great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what? One of the running backs for the Eagles will be signing footballs at the stadium next week, you ought to bring your kids.
Which running back  is this?
I think Ryan Marshall
He's pretty good. What time is this gonna take place
Monday at five o'clock
Are you gonna bring your kids
Yes, but they prefer The Giants
Yeah my kids like them too.
Mines have Giants paraphernalia everywhere
But if you want any of their stars to autograph your things you will have to go to New York
Yeah. We drove there two years ago to get jackets signed by Orleans Darkwa
Who?
One of the running backs for the Giants
Wow, was it worth it? That's a ten hour drive
Yes. The kids really wanted the autograph, it was definitely worth it. We have driven there before to see the games
My kids would rather fly. We flew to New York to see a Jets game last year.
Oh yeah, you told me about that. What signature did you get that time ?
None. We just went to see the game
Well I guess I will see you and your family at the stadium next week. Did you say five o'clock?
Yes, can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you're a 49er fan.  Name some players.
Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Steve Young, Ronnie Lott, Dwight Clark, Keena Turner, Bubba Paris...
Whoa--current players.
Uh, give me a moment.
Living in the past like all 49er fans.
Hold on, there's Navarro Bowman and Carlos Hyde and uh
Who's the quarterback?
I don't know.
You don't know the quarterback of the team you root for?
Well, I'm not sure they know.
Pretty sad--what's the problem with the team.
The ownership--who gets rid of Jim Harbaugh?
Yeah, he took them to two conference championships and one Super Bowl.
So, oh well, let's get rid of the coach.
Then you have a different coach every year.
Don't remind me--Singletary, Tomsula, Kelly, oh my gosh.
Probably more the management's fault than the coach's.
I suppose.
And now you have Kyle Shanahan
Other than the play call that probably blew the Super Bowl for Atlanta, I think he'll be o.k.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about Thursday Night Football. Is it a good idea or a bad idea?
The NFL on Thursday has been around for decades, and some of the NFL's most memorable games have been played on Thursdays.
But now players complain...
There is a move by the union to keep the players off the field as much as possible. This effort is not sustainable. The only concession the union is likely to get from the league on this point is larger rosters so more players are available.
A concession the union doesn't want...
Exactly. Instead of seeing increased value in growing the rank and file, they see decreased value in carving up the revenue pie into more slices. The union believes in the "fixed pie" fallacy.
What about the Cowboys dominating scheduling for prime time games?
This is a case of "the more things change, the more they stay the same." A review of the schedule from 1978-1982 shows the Cowboys in the same position, including playing in what were then novel Sunday Night Football games.
The Chiefs get a lot of attention in big game scheduling also.
Kansas City is a great venue for football, televised or otherwise, and the Chiefs have some nationwide appeal, and also the same "middle America" appeal that Green Bay enjoys.
Is playing in Mexico City a good idea?
I think so. Only the NFL knows if it makes money on such efforts, but it certainly opens up markets for the participating teams.
The Raiders are a good fit.
They are, and the Chargers should get on board as well. Taking the same approach to Mexico that Jacksonville has to London might have enabled the Chargers to stay in San Diego and make a go of it.
Will the Jaguars move to London permanently?
I doubt it. There are too many problems with that relating to travel, taxation and marketing. But their current approach to London is working for them, it seems.
Is NFL expansion on the horizon?
Unlikely. The "fixed pie" fallacy appeals to the league as it does to the union, and scheduling gets harder as more teams are added. There aren't many attractive markets for expansion.
Are any teams prone to relocation now?
Not really. Buffalo is secure with new ownership. Jacksonville is going nowhere. The Chargers might go back to San Diego, but that's unlikely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Elliot rush for 2000 yards this year?
It very much is in realm of possibility for him.
I think he could eclipse it with ease.
That would mean Dak doesnt have to throw it often enough.
Yeah and I think thats the plan for the Cowboys
The problem is their defense
You think it could be bad?
Yeah I mean their secondary is in shambles.
But their offense keeps them off the field
Right but if they get into shootouts I am not sure if they can keep up
Maybe teams run on them to kill the clock as well.
I think they need to be aggressive in rushing Prescott
He seems to work well under pressure
The numbers say if he gets flushed out it could be lights out
Could you imagine if he has a bad year?
They probably would regret getting Romo out of there.
He could always still come back
I am sure CBS prevented that from happening.
How so?
They probably bonused him alot of cash and he would have to pay it back
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, now I'm all hyped up for the season. i can't wait until September, It's still 2 months away...
August 10 is the preseason. So we only have one more month left.
Preseason games kinda suck
Well,l they're not really games as much as a show case
Show case for what?
For the new recruits. They show off what they can do how they fit with the teamm etc.
Honestly, we don't need that.
Um. Yes we do. It helps us to prepare for the games. See how much improvements new people bring.
They don't really play seriously.
Because they're interested in showcasing.
It seems silly to me. Anyway, I wonder who will be the most improved team this year
People say Titans, but will see. I love Mariota so seeing him get one of the best WR is a good thing.
I hink Patriots will improve and be even more dominant
Why?
They got revamped on WR, RB, TE and DE positions. Their depth is amazing
Eh. maybe.
I think Ravens will improve a lot this year too
How's that?
Ravens D is gonna be even more dominant now this year with all the new players they picked up.
Eh, guess we'll see. I kinda also liked Texans. Deshaun Watson. Enough said.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've heard some news about roster changes for various NFL teams for the fall.
I haven't really been keeping up on things.
Why not?
I really only ever followed the Rams, and since they left St. Louis, I haven't paid much attention.
Oh that makes sense.
Who do you follow now?
I've become something of a cheesehead, among other teams.
The Packers?
Yep.
Why them?
Well, they're pretty close.
Geographically?
Yeah, I guess.
Aren't the Chiefs closer?
Yes, but I can't stand them.
I guess that makes sense. Who else do you follow?
I've always liked the Broncos.
They've been a pretty good team.
And the vikings.
Them too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate waiting on the NFL to return!
I know! I wish we could have football year around.
Who is your favorite team?
I love the Tennessee Titans!
Are you a big fan?
Yes! I have loved them ever since I was a child.
Who is your all time favorite player in franchise history?
I would have to say Steve McNair would be my favorite.
I liked him a lot, he was a really good quarterback.
Yea, he came so close to winning us a Superbowl. I still think about that game!
I do not blame you, that was one of the best Superbowl games of all time.
We were simply one yard short of winning it all. That is the only game that has ever made me cry.
I think I would have cried to if that happened to the Raiders.
I did not know you are a Raiders fan.
Yea, they have been my team for a very long time.
Who would you say is your favorite player in Raider history?
I will go with Bo Jackson! He is the best in my book.
Bo was a great player! I think he should be considered among the top five running backs of all time.
I feel the same way! He was also a great baseball player as well.
He was a rare specimen to say the least!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl X.
Which one was that?
Pittsburgh over Dallas.
Where was it played.
The Orange Bowl.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Terry Bradshaw and Roger Staubach.
What was the score after the first quarter?
7-7.
And at the half?
10-7, Dallas, on a field goal.
Who was in the halftime show?
Up with People celebrating the Bicentennial.
Any scoring in the third?
No.
Sounds tight.
The fourth quarter featured a safety on a blocked punt.
So it was 10-9 for awhile?
Yes, but Pittsburgh prevailed, 21-17.
Pretty interesting game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the new NFL celebration rules?
Not really, Goodell found a way to make it less fun, even though they are allowing more of a celebration.
Do you mean the new focus on clock management after a touchdown?
Yeah and they are supposedly limiting the tv timeouts so that the game flows better and finishes on time.
I'm not sure you can always predict which games will flow smoothly, because injuries and penalties in the nfl tend to be rather lengthy.
That's why I'm not sure why they modified the celebration rules for the players at all.
I think because the NFL is trying to capture a younger audience, they know they have to make it entertaining for those who may not be interested in the Xs and Os.
Yes, but the refs will have the ultimate say, just like before, in regards to player conduct.
Maybe Antonio Brown will get away with some of his flashier dances after scoring the touchdown?
Only if he doesn't slow the pace of play, because the play clock will start after the ref signals the score.
I think that might make some teams' kicks a bit rushed and little less accurate than before the rule change.
There are those kickers who seem to be flustered in times of great stress, but most of the long time kickers will practice the situation with their units.
Whatever the league office's motives are in this case, there are going to be some great highlight reels at the end of every Sunday!
As long as the refs let the players have a little fun, the NFL fans might relax a bit, too.
I was wondering if any of the celebration rules had to do with player safety as the league is trying to make that a focus.
Do you mean that excessive celebration leads to other teams getting chippy and causing some personal fouls?
Not necessarily, no. I'm thinking more along the lines of large offensive lineman jumping on the smaller players in celebration and accidentally hurting their players.
That could be a hazard, but I think it's important for teams to celebrate together and build up rapport with one another.
I don't really know what the NFL owners' intentions were with the new touchdown rules, but I hope it makes the games go by a bit quicker!
Yeah those Monday night football games end so late for those who watch on the East coast!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe you were able to watch all the Cleveland Browns games last season.
As a die hard Browns fan, I will never miss a single one of their games!
That sounds so painful. So what do you think of their upcoming season.
I'm really excited about drafting Myles Garrett and I think he will make their defense really solid.
I'm excited to see how Myles will look out there. There was so much hype going into the draft about him and then all that buzz about the Browns trading away their #1 pick to move down or for a quarterback.
I know there was so much noise, but I was hoping they kept the draft pick so they could draft Myles and they did, so I'm pretty excited and happy about the upcoming season.
I caught a few Browns games last season and they didn't look that bad. They lost a lot of close games.
Most of the Browns games last season were such heart breaking losses.
What's the team looking like this season aside from Myles Garrett?
Well you know we have offensive line super star Joe Thomas, and of course we have Joe Haden on defense in the secondary so we're always going to be excited about that.
Joe Thomas is so good but not a lot of other football fans know how good he is. Joe Haden gets more publicity but he's really good.
That's what has me excited because on defense we have Myles Garrett now to chase after opposing quarterbacks and we have Joe Haden in the secondary to guard top wide receivers. Haden is also a big playmaker.
I'm looking forward to the Browns taking the next step and making themselves more of a respectable team competitively.
I think you'll see it this season. Joe Thomas protects the quarterback so well and he's such a good run blocker too.
Do you know who's starting at quarterback for the Browns this season.
Well the Browns signed Brock Osweiler who I'm not thrilled about, but I do like their draft pick of DeShone Kizer and hoping he really shows out well during training camp going into the season.
Kizer looks like a very exciting prospect for the Browns.
There's also Cody Kessler who's a safe play at quarterback too. With another season under his belt and some options on offense I think he might really emerge as the starting QB for the Browns.
I think they'll make some improvements in the season but it's going to be tough especially in their division.
Tell me about it, the AFC Central is brutal with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there
Hey
What do you want to talk about
Lets talk about football
Okay
Its one of my favorite sports
Me too
Its so much fun to watch
It really is
My favprite team is the redskins

Who do you like?
I lile the patriots
They are pretty good too
I have always love them
Im the same way with the redskins
Its a sports thing
I guess so
Ill never give up on my team
Me either
XXXXXXXXXXX
Damon Harrison is so funny. Did you hear what he said on Good Morning America?
No  what did he do?
It's not what he did, its what he said.
Well, What did he say?
He made a comparison to Eli Manning and Lebron James.
Are you kidding me? In what context?
He said when you look at Eli Manning, it's like how you look at Lebron James.
That is funny.
I guess he is saying that Eli Manning is the Lebron James of the NFL.
(Laugher) I can see how he can look at things like that.
Lebron James is the superstar of the NBA.
Just like Eli Manning the the superstar of the NFL.
Both are really great players at their sport for sure.
That is the truth.
Eli has definetly had a good few years for awhile now.
Something definetly changed from 2013.
Yeah he did not have a good year back then.
He sure did turn things around.
That was a huge complement that Damon Harrison gave Eli Manning.
Yeah and Lebron James too!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The AFC has a great Division this year
I agree. I like Marcus Peters and the Chiefs to do well.
I think Marshawn Lynch is going to carry the Oakland Raiders
The Seahawks certainly haven't been as good without Lynch
As much as I don't like Lynch I agree.
Why don't you like him?
He just seems too cocky
I mean. Aren't most NFL players?
True. I guess that's how you get to the NFL
I think Sean McVay is going to be an asset to the rams this year
I think so too.
I think the Panthers need to come up with a plan to help Cam Newton out more too
Yeah. He's talented but he needs work
He needs a team that can mentor him
His accuracy isn't that great
They should take some pressure off him with different strategies
I agree
We'll see how they do this year
Ron Rivera can make it happen I think
He is a great coach
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey buddy, are you excited for the upcoming season?
You know it! The Giants have been on a tear with acquisitions this offseason!
True, but Wentzylvania got some weapons this off-season! Alshon and Torrey Smith, I think the Eagles are gonna be great!
No way, man, the Eagles? When was the last time they won a ring? The first Super Bowl was before the Eagles' roster was even born.
We...don't have one. But hey, the NFC East is looking weaker too, right?
You must be praying for Zeke to get hurt, we're both in trouble with that 1-2 punch in Dallas.
This is true, but hey, they'll lose in the playoffs like they did to Green Bay last year!
That Aaron Rodgers is a BAAD man, definitely 1st QB off the board in fantasy this year. Detroit's just praying for no more Hail Marys.
Speaking of which, have you talked to the commissioner about doing our fantasy league again this year? I need to defend my crown
Oh, without a doubt! He told me the draft will be next month, who you got first?
Easily Antonio Brown, the best wide receiver in all of the NFL, stat-machine.
I don't know man, Big Ben is reaching the end of his rope, you think he'll hold up?
Easily, I think the Steelers have a couple more runs in them, especially with their weak division.
Poor Cleveland, think they'll struggle again?
Probably, they had a strong draft but they're a few years away from being competitive, barring bad luck.
For sure, who's your sleeper this season?
The Tennesee Titans, they are certainly underrated coming into the season and adding more weapons, how about you?
I'd have to say the Arizona Cardinals, they've got a strong core who had an off-year, I think they'll be back to the Big Dance.
Wow, bold call, but it's been a pleasure, I must be going, i'll see you at the draft!
Same to you, very fun. Talk to you soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any particualr NFL team?
I like the Cardinals, I know they arent really a winning team but I like them.
Oh yeah howcome?
I like them because Im from Phonix so that team has a special meaning to me.
That makes sense have you been to one of their games.
Actually I have, Ive been to several.
Sounds like your a big fan.
Yeah I think I am but its mostly because my dad used to take me and now its kind of a tradition.
Yeah I can see why you like that team a lot.
What is your favorite team?
I dont have a favorite team but I do like Broncos and Dolphins.
Those teams are pretty cool as well.
Are you exited about the new NFL season?
Yeah I am hopefully my team does a great job.
Do you know about any good contrations the cardinals has this season?
I like T.J. Logan hes a really fast RB.
I see,  havent really heard of him
Hes a great player what about Haason Reddick?
Hes a good player Ive heard of him and actually watch him play with Temple.
I think hes one of the best additions this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We only have two month left iuntil the season starts!!!
I can't wait. Pre-season is almost here too!!!
Do you want to go to a pre-season game?
No, the stars player never get that much time.
What do you think about the NY Giants?
I think Odell and Marshall are going to help Eli get big numbers.
Do you think they will make the play off?
Hell yell they going all the way.
they have a lot of issues in the past but they are getting better.
I think the giants have to deal with Dallas as the biggest threat in the NFC East
Yeah they got a good team, but I think they got lucky last year.
Dak was a beast
He was unknown so no one knew how to defend him
So you think this year he isn't going to be as good?
Oh yeah, not that teams got a good look at him, the defenses are going to stop him a lot more
what was the washingtion
Washington doesn't have a steady QB. Every year there is an issue
Yeah cousin is good but not a leader
That why he has gotten a long term contract
maybe he will after this year
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Tom Brady?
What do you mean?
How he is so great year after year?
It is pretty amazing.
Yes he inspires me.
How so?
He demonstrates excellence and a committment to success like none other.
Yes I can see that.
I try to emulate what he does in my own life.
That is a good philosophy.
Yes he really is precise and handles pressure well.
Yes we can say a lot about him.
Yes he does so many things well.
He is impressive.
I followed him since he was at Michigan.
Wow you know his history.
Yes he has performed well with great effort since day 1.
Yes he does define football excellence.
Yes I like what he does.
Yes he is a joy to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the game on at your house this weekend?
Yea, we will have the next three games at my house.
Who are we playing against?
The Raiders this week.
Do they still have Derek Carr?
Yea.
Isn't he from fresno state?
Yes, why?
I have a cousin who went there.
Nice.
When are they playing the cowboys?
August 26.
You coming over for that one.
Don't know yet.
I heard they were going to change running backs.
Nope, different team.
I heard jackson was thinking of leaving.
I think its not going to happen.
Well if it does it could hurt the team.
They will still have a really strong team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will make it to the Super bowl this year?
I think the Steelers and Falcons have a good chance, how about you?
I'm going to say the Cowboys and Patriots.
You think the Cowboys can beat the Falcons?
I think it will come down to who has home field advantage in the playoff game.
I think Dallas will have an off year, they're still a young team.
They have some great young players though, I think they'll be tough.
They have a tough schedule though but you never know.
I think the AFC is definitely the Pats or Steelers though.
I think Pittsburgh just has too many weapons though.
I think they depend on if Bell gets hurt.
Yeah, he's a little injury prone but probably best back in the league when he's healthy.
Oh yeah I agree but he's never healthy for long.
They got more protection this year though, so if him and Brown stay healthy I don't see anyone beating them.
I still think Brady takes it.
Who do you think wins it all though?
I think the Pats in a close game, how about you?
I think Pittsburgh takes it, I can't see any NFC team competing with the Pats or Steelers.
I think they can stay close but I agree the AFC is going to be tough to beat.
Yeah, it's going to be a good season I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have the worst co-worker at my workplace.
What, are they stealing your stapler?
Even worse, they're a Steelers fan.
Ah, I see.
Steeler fans are everywhere and I can't figure out why.
They are a popular team.
Right, but nobody is ever actually from Pittsburgh.
I think people like their uniforms.
Yeah, the yellow and gold definitely stand out.
I think that's part of their allure.
What I really can't stand is the terrible towel.
Man, they love waving those things.
They are everywhere too.  Can't watch a game on TV without seeing them.
They seem to rally the team pretty well.
Guys like Bell and Brown really do seem to get a jolt of them.
Speaking of which, Brown is probably the best receiver in football.
He's up there, not sure I'd say he's #1 though.
Best route runner though, don't you think?
Possibly.  He's so explosive, I'd love to have him on my team.
Most teams would!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will anyone break Peyton Manning's passing record for yardage?
Drew Brees really has a good shot at it.
I think Tom Brady could even do it.
If I had my money on it though it would be Matt Ryan
Why do you think that?
He has alot of weapons at his disposal.
So did the other guys we mentioned.
Yeah but hes young and hes playing in a time when passing is the name of the game.
Brees has literally done nothing but throw the ball in New Orleans.
Yeah and I think he will break it.
So why do you bring up Ryan
I think he will end up with even more yardage
Its interesting but I cant see Ryan throwing for 5000 yards ever.
Me neither, but he never gets hurt and has the weapons around him
I know he had a great year but Shannahan is not his coordinator anymore
Thats true but hes still an elite talent
I think they take a step back though this year
With that defense and receiving corps? No way!
The super bowl hangover is a real curse.
Oh yeah I forgot about that. You are probably on to something
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will there be a race in the NFC South next year?
There might be.     Which teams do you like?
Well, I don't think they will compete, but even the Carolina Panthers have improved.
True, there defense was pretty good last season, even with Luke Kuechly out.
So next up is the New Orleans Saints?
They will improve, but I don't know how much better than 0.500 they can be.
Aren't they trying to sign Adrian Petersen?
That is the word on the street, but that probably is not enough.
The second place team last year was Tampa Bay.
Yes, they made the wildcard game.
Will they do the same this season?
They have improved and have a chance, but I do not see another playoff run.
OK.     That leaves the Atlanta Falcons.
Yes.    Team on the rise, and they might even make the Super Bowl against Houston or New England.
Wow!    That's quite a prediction.
They are that good.
Great, you think the NFC South will look a lot like last season.
Atlanta and Tampa at the top, yes.
What about at the bottom.
I think it could go either way with New Orleans and Carolina.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, I am not sure about the Seahawks. I believe more in the Patriots.
Yea, I'm not sure. I just feel like the Patriots have to lose eventually.
Yea, whose gonna beat them? The Jets?
HA! Thats laughable. Talk about a disgrace of a team.
Yea, they really seem to be going nowhere fast.
Exactly! Miami could pose a challenge though.
Yea, I'm just not sold on Ryan Tannehill yet. Are you?
I'm not sure about him either, but he has a nice supporting cast.
I agree, but eventually he has to just do it or not.
He is still just a middle of the road quarterback.
Yea, Miami needs a top flight quarterback if they really want to do good.
Yea, I agree, but he has not proven to do that yet.
Yea, I agree. They have some good receivers and playmakers, but he hasn't proven much yet.
Yea, Miami just hasn't done much.
Yea, even if they have some success, I'm not sure that they can take down New England.
Yea, New England just continues to get stronger and especially with their addition of a star cornerback.
Yea, they just keep getting better.
They sure use free agency that way it is intended to be.
Yea, they do build through the draft, but fill holes through free agency.
Yea, well that is definitely the right way to do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wouldn't count out Green Bay just yet either.
Yea, just when you think they are done, they start winning.
Last year at one point, they looked awful. Then look.
Yea, they made a nice run to the playoffs.
Well, you know this is a quarterback driven league.
You're right. With a top 3 quarterback, you can always be in contention.
I completely agree, but you also need playmakers and I'm just not sure Rodgers has that anymore.
Well, he has some guys to throw to, but I'm not sure if they can stop anybody.
Yea, I can't even name anyone on that defense.
Yea, neither can opposing offenses.
Well, its been that way for New Orleans now for years.
Brees throws for 500 yards and 4 touchdowns and still loses.
Yea, it has been. They have made very little effort to improve that defense.
Yea, it is a shame because Brees isn't getting any younger.
Yea, they did add Adrian Peterson, but it seems like he is washed up anyway.
Yea, he might just be a goal line back there.
I thought he might try to win a starting job. It looks like thats not really available there.
True, but you really never know with injuries.
Yea, its amazing how short of a career running backs have.
Yea, well they take a lot of hits thats for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Bill, wanna catch the Falcons pre season game next weekend?
That'd be great what time
Starts at 4
Do you wanna tail gate
You bet what should I bring
The usual, FOOD
Can I bring my wife?
Sure if she likes our rowdy crowd LOL
She loves going to games with me.  She'll bring her hot sister too
Hey there.  I'd like that even better if she's a Falcons fan
She IS..She lives in Atlanta.
Super.  I have great seats for us
Do you think we have room for any more people
Yes, I've got 10 tickets so ask around
Do you think it'll be a good season this year
Hard to say right now, that's why we're going to this preseason game
Hope so, would love another Super Bowl game!
Me too pal,  See you soon
I'll call you in a couple of days
later dude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Brandon how's it going?
Going well Dan just watching some old foozeball games.
Ahh cool me and my uncle used to watch the old Superbowls too.
I'm watching some old Patriots videos, I never realized Tom Brady has been playing since the 90s.
That is truly remarkable, and his arm hasn't ever looked better.
The guy is stud with an incredible team at his back.
I completely agree man, and with Gronkowski coming back from injury they should stay solid.
I completely forgot about Gronk, he's really coming back from injury?
Yeah man, it was bad, and it seems like forever since he played.
I remember last year they went 17-2 without him which is just insane on it's own.
Bellicheck and Brady can handle the game.
Oh for sure, but it's just child play for them now.
These guys are getting older, and the younger teams seem to be really hungry.
Very true, but fear an old man in a place where men die young.
That is a strange analogy, but I kind of understand.
It's just dog eat dog out there, and the wisest players are the most experienced.
You are right, that experience and intelligence has carried the Patriots through a lot of wins.
You want to watch some more film with me?
Oh for sure I could watch and talk football all day.
Take a seat and grab a beer bud!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ron Holmes is down!
Oh no!
Big Brock just landed on him.
Ouch!
Big Brock is 350 pounds.
How big is Ron?
He's pushing 250.
One hundred pound difference there.
That's gotta hurt bad.
What's his status?
They're tending to him still.
It looks bad.
Ok, they're loading him onto the stretcher.
Is he awake?
Barely.
I really hope he's ok.
They need him.
Ok, the crowd is clapping.
They're wheeling him off.
Get better, Ron!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL \team?
I tend to go for the team who wins.  I used to be a Saints fan but the Seahawks are my number one.
I like the Eagles but, the torture/
Who likes the Eagles dude and why?   Pick a team who wins.
Carson Wentz will win for the Eagles, Count on that.
Well, maybe but to go to a game in Philly only to see the other team win>
The NFL is just another time and patience situation for Philly fans so I know that Howie Roseman gets what he is doing as the GM.
I always wanted to be lucky enough to attend a game in various stadiums, any interest in picking a city or two this season?
Sure but can we avoid the GIants and Cowboys?
Sure, but can we go to the Patriots?  Brady is the man and what an awesome environment is looks like there.
I remember so clearly the year that Brady and the Patriots beat my Seahaws in the Super Bowl.
I actually respect the Patriots and Brady even if they have broken both of our ghearts.
Lets go look online for the NFL schedule.
We could go to a preseason game to start this season off, how about the GIants versus Jets
THe Meadowlands are awesome but you drive.  I think the Jets might be good some year
Todd Bowles is an awesome coach.  Former Temple and Eagles coach.
The Ravens might be good again this season.  Joe Flacco is a guy that most in sports appreciate, not the typical spoiled baby qv.
So Patirots vs Baltimore?
Awesome. I love football and I love the antiction of fall and the sport
Go Patriots!

When was the last time fair catch kick resulted in a score in an NFL game, I wonder...
Huh. that's a great question.. I have no idea. If ever, for that matter...
I'm gonna go look.
Me too. Google it.
No I'm gonna wiki it.
Google will give you the wiki link.
So why not just go directly to wiki?
Whatever, Ok The last time a successful fair catch kick led to a score is... 1976!!!
Bills and Chargers game.
They did try it a bunch of more times though.
The latest being the 49ers and Rams game.
Yeah. Phil Dawson missed it.
I remember that game. it sucked.
No games ever suck.
Some games suck.
Only if you let it.
See fair catch kick is dangerous though. you know why?
Oh here we go. Tell me why
Because if it comes short, the ball is still live and the opposing team can return it.
Haha, yeah like bama and auburn game from a few years back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This might be the final season we see Larry Fitzgerald and Carson Palmer play together for the Arizona Cardinals.
I hope Carson can last and make it through this season injury free. I know Larry is an ironman.
Do you think they'll retire after the season is over or sign with another team?
I hope they retire with the Arizona Cardinals. I'm oldschool in my thinking of wanting my favorite franchise players to retire with the team that they spent their career with.
It would be fantastic to see Larry retire as a Cardinal. I couldn't imagine him in another team's uniform.
Larry Fitzgerald is the best wide receiver in the Cardinals franchise history.
I can't debate that.
I can see them going out big this season. If healthy, they should be able to take the NFC West.
You don't think the Seahawks will give them a run?
Oh I definitely think the Seahawks will be a big challenge.
I just want to see the Cardinals fully healthy this season.
They had one of the best defenses in the league before injuries took their toll on the team.
Mathieu is going to be back stronger and better than ever. I can't wait to see him knock wide receivers and running backs down across the field.
That defense was so intimidating a few seasons ago.
We'll see it again. This is the year the Cardinals make it back to the Superbowl!
Wouldn't that be great to see.
It would be fantastic. Larry Fitzgerald would go out on top finally winning a Superbowl!
They were so close in one of the best Superbowls I can remember back in Superbowl 43.
That 2008 season was such a memorable season. To come up 27-23, was so heart breaking.
I still have nightmares of that Superbowl loss. This season we make up for it though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey..countdown for the NFL 2017 begins are u excited?
Yep...waiting to see what is in store for this year
I see there are lot of new and exciting players?
Yes each team has done their homework
I see there are lot of senior players are waiting to prove the point
Yes also dont forget Big ben or Tom Brady
I believe this will be Big Ben's year dont you think?
I also believe he deserves one more ring
It was a close season last time but i believe this year can be his..
Speaking about this makes me eager to wait for the kick off game
Do you think the pre-season games have any help to the teams?
I dont think so...it is kind of becoming a waste
I generall dont watch the preseason games...not that exciting
Me too...but hopefully this year will be different
Hopefully we will get to see different teams in the playoffs
Yep i want to see the change..want to see more youngsters
Based on the predictions young guns are going to rock this season
I am also waiting to see that
Lets set up a kick off party at our place
thats a good way to begin the season...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I actually don't know that much about the NFL. Who is your favorite?
I love the Cleveland Browns.
Oh no, even I know they aren't very good!
This is true. But maybe this year will be different.
I hope so, for your sake! How did they do last year?
They won one game.
Oh no! Who did they beat?
The San Diego Chargers.
I am not too familiar with the Chargers. Are the Browns usually better than that?
Yeah, well in 2015 they were 3-13.
I see. Who is their head coach?
They had a new head coach last year, Hue Jackson.
Oh I don't know anything about him.
He was previously the offensive coordinator for the Bengals.
Oh, where are the Bengals from?
They are Ohio's other team, they are from Cincinnati.
Interesting. Are the Browns going to keep Hue Jackson for next year?
Well, they haven't fired him yet!
Well I hope next year is better for you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The GREEN BAY PACKERS won the first Super Bowl.
That was in 1967.
It was in LA.
They played the KANSAS CITY CHIEFS.
35-10 was the final score.
Green Bay won the Super Bowl the next year also.
NEW YORK JETS won their first one in 1969.
DALLAS COWBOYS won their first one in 1972.
MIAMI DOLPHINS won 2 in a row.
Then PITTSBURG STEELERS won 2 in a row.
Then they won 2 in a row again a few years later.
Buffalo Bills  appeared in the Super Bowl 4 years in a row.
DALLAS COWBOYS almost won 4 in a row.
The city the SUPER BOWL is chosen to be played in is decided years in advance.
I think it takes a while to plan it.
Pittsburg Steelers have won the most SUPER BOWLS.
DALLAS COWBOYS have 5 wins.
Two other teams have won 5 also.
Miami had 3 consecutive appearances.
Denver Broncos have lost 5 SUPER BOWLS.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Planning to watch the NFL this fall?
Not really, kinda tired of it all.
Really? Why?
Same ol' same ol'. Watch hundreds of games over fifty years and they all start to look the same.
That surprises me. You used to he a huge Miami Dolphins fan. Larry Csonka was your hero.
Yep, I even sported a number 39 jersey through most of elementary school.
I remember that from old family photos. Who was the QB then?
Bob Griese. One of the most underrated QBs ever.
I barely remember him. When did he stop playing?
Around 1981 or so. Dan Marino took over after him.
The Dolphins were a great team back in the 70s, won a few superbowls.
Yeah and went undefeated in 1972. Still the only team that's done that.
New England almost did it a few years back but then lost the Big One.
Yeah, that was a shocker. Another reason I don't like NFL much anymore. New England and all their cheating.
I don't think that's anything new.
Maybe not, but I guess all the money in it changes things. One reason I prefer college ball these days.
I hear you, but watching college ball looks a lot like watching high school ball. Not as professional.
Haha. I like high school ball! Those 70-3 score games are a hoot.
Except nowadays that's considered bad form and they put the 5th string in after the lead hits about 30.
Can't upset the precious snowflakes;)
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time?
As a Patriots fan, I'm probably biased so I'd say yes. It is hard to argue with five Super Bowls championships.
It seems like you are hesitant.
Well, I also recognize that the game is totally different now that for a Johnny Unitas or Joe Montana.
That's respectable.
Peyton and Favre also have a ton of records, but when it comes down to it, I think championships become the tiebreaker.
I think that's fair. I'm not a Patriots fan, but I think it's a hard argument to say that Brady isn't the best.
I agree in general, but I also look at the fact that Brady played a lot longer than all the others.
Are you arguing against him now?
No, just trying to recognize that I'm biased!
That's fair. I really do think he's cemented himself as the best quarterback.
Counterarguments and all, I do agree. I think he could be in conversation for the best ever player, but I don't know that he's got that.
That is so difficult. It is like comparing apples to oranges.
I know. How do you compare a quarterback with a receiver or back? I just don't think you can do it.
If you look at stats alone, Jerry Rice may be the best of all time.
For sure. His records are mind blowing. Although some say Jim Brown deserves the title of best ever.
Okay help me out here. Who is he?
Way before our time. He played for the Browns from '57-'65,
I guess I need to look into him.
You should. He's in the conversation, but like with Brady now, it was just a totally different time and game then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think makes the playoffs in ncaa football this season?
Conversation starts with Alabama as usual. Roll tide.
Of course. Let's get Ohio State in the mix too.
Clemson out of the ACC.
Oklahoma Sooners.
Even with Stoops resigning? That gives me pause with a new regime.
Good point, I forgot.
Washington could be back in the mix again.
You know, they're interesting. I think they'll still be quality but they lost some key defensive guys in the draft.
Their secondary might take a step back, but they'll still be good and the PAC-10 isn't great.
PAC-10 isn't great, but I have a feeling USC is about to have another run. They seem poised to get back in the top tier.
Yeah, they have Darnold so they should be in for a good showing.
Who are we forgetting?
Florida State. Florida Gators for that matter.
I don't know about Florida, I still have LSU better than them as well as Alabama.
At the risk of flooding with SEC, I think you can throw Auburn into the mix for potential.
Dark horse for Wisconsin, I just have a feeling they can come out strong in the B1G.
Interesting. I was looking through their profiles earlier and it looks like their returning some key guys.
What about Penn St? Can't forget Penn St.
We'd all like to forget about Penn St.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why didn't the patriots run the ball
not to smart
They would have one that super bowl
Yes they would have
Patriots would have never stopped lynch
No they wouldn't have
He was a train
I mean you have a running back they couldn't stop
And you pass the ball
over the middle no less
right
at least throw it to the outside
or drop back and pass it
dont throw it over the MIDDLE
would have loved to see the look on the players faces when they got the play call
lynch would have been like "huh"
"are you serious"
i would have been cracking up
yeah me tooi
would have been priceless
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the projection for the nest year? Who's the best team?
That's hard to say.
Guess. Or make an educated guess.
Now that's even harder. Educated guesses in this scenario require us to look at the team's strengths and weakness and whether or not the draft did anything.
I think Dak Prescott is going take the Cowboys to the Superbowl
Hah. No way man. Prescott is good, but not that good. I can see the cowboys winning their division, but probably won't get past the conference championship
Who do yo think will win the NFC then?
Either the Packers or Seahawks. Unless they both get a bunch of injuries, then Cowboys might win the NFC
That's a very real possibility.
yeah, but it's also very real possibility that Cowboys may suffer injuries as well. So...
Huh. man, I want the Cowboys to win the superbowl so bad, they haven;'t been to one in years
Last one was back in 1996. They've won that
That was the triple X game. That was hilarious.
Roman numerals suck. They should just change to numbers.
no way man, it's a tradition.
They didn't stick with the tradition for the 50th, now it's pointless
I don't know I think it's cool. Anyway. So who's gonna win the AFC? Pats again?
That's what I'm thinking. They got picked up Brandin Cooks to add to their receiving core.
I think Cooks is overated. he only ranks high because Brees loves to throw and Cooks is his favorite target
That just says he's a good receiver...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if Kirk Cousins and the Redskins ever struck a deal?
No, they never found a middle ground.
That's too bad. I thought they were supposed to be close?
First he was far away from a deal, then they were close, now they're far away again.
What is he asking for?
The rumors were north of $20 million per year.
Well, it's not even clear if he really wants to return.
Yeah, I didn't think he'd even consider an offer.
Where does he want to go?
Reportedly the 49ers, where his old offensive coordinator is now the coach.
Do you think the Redskins will just slap the franchise tag again on next year?
I doubt it. That carries a salary over $30 million, guaranteed.
And the Redskins need help in other areas, for sure.
I don't want they're expecting to happen at wide receiver.
I think they're counting on Jamison Crowder to make a leap, and Terrelle Pryor should be solid.
I guess, but he's still getting used to the position.
Jordan Reed's a nice safety valve, anyway.
Don't you still worry about his health, though?
Of course, but I think Vernon Davis can still be a decent stopgap.
Until he hits his wall, and at his age, you know it's coming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you getting excited about training camp for football?
Yes.  It's been a long time since the Super Bowl.
I know you have been enjoying Baseball!
Yes, but it's getting to be the All Star break, so things are getting slow
And your other sports, Hockey and Basketball?
They are both on break right now, too.
So you are excited about the start of Football?
Absolutely.  I can't wait to see how the new players do.
Didn't the Redskins move their training camp?
Yes.  It used to be in Ashburn, now it's in Richmond.
Do you think the players like that better?
I think the fans like it better.
Are there any players you are looking forward to seeing?
There are some new players that I'm excited about.
Haven't they signed some free agents recently?
Corner Back Fabian Moreau and Line Backer Nico Marley were signed towards the end of May.
Wasn't there someone signed in June?
I think they signed defensive back Lou Young.
Are you looking forward to a good season?
I sure hope it's better than last year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you consider incomplete to be mediocre.
My basis for good includes preseason appearances which he excelled in.
Of course that might not translate when facing the regulars, but apples to apples would indicate a good QB.
But if you think Good requires Franchise QB level play for several years, then I think your standard is a bit high.
I'm pleased with the QB situation and am anxious to see where things go.
If we win half our first six games, then we are in great shape with a distinctly unfavorable schedule to begin the season.
Watson hasn't even thrown a pass yet.
I will take no touchdown passes over no passes at all.
Lol Watson needs time.
Either that or he's gonna run a lot to extend plays/generate offense.
I dont want him getting hit like Cam or RG 3rd.
Bingo! Or worse like Carr, the hits and sacks he took ruined him for the rest of his career.
Even the OL we have now could have helped see if he was as good as advertised.
It's football so he's going to get hit.
Now if you really want him to be protected. Then put him in flag football.
preseason is basically vanilla all across the board.
The game against Dallas he couldn't even read the defense against 3rd and 4th stringers.
That's the game he got hurt in.
Savage is a good quarterback. That's my opinion after watching all his film.
I concur ! After watching Osweiller all season, the superiority of Savage was ultra - obvious when he took the reins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long do you think Tom Brady will keep playing?
Isn't he like 40 now? Probably only another year or two
Some people think he'll play for way longer than that
Wasn't Peyton Manning only about a year or two older than Brady when he retired?
Yeah and he wasn't playing all that well in his last season, despite winning the Super Bowl
I'd really like to see someone else in the Super Bowl than the same three AFC teams the past fifteen years
So do I, aside from the Patriots, Steelers, and whoever Peyton Manning was playing for
Do you think Peyton Manning was a better quarterback than Tom Brady?
Brady had the better numbers, but I think Peyton Manning was smarter overall
So what even makes someone the best to play the quarterback position?
I don't know, but I doubt everyone will ever come to an agreement one way or the other
Why do you think people don't like Tom Brady? Aside from all the Patriots fans, that is
Probably a mix of his ungodly talent versus low expectations, and all the cheating accusations over the years
I don't think he really cheated after all
He may not have, but he destroyed his cell phone when he was under suspicion and likely to be called in for an investigation
Who destroys a cell phone anyway? Maybe it isn't against NFL rules, but it seems fishy to me
Anyway, once Brady retires, we might actually get some parity in the AFC
And before then, we can always count on Eli Manning coming out of nowhere to lead the Giants to a victory over the Patriots
As a non-Patriots fan, I'll forever be grateful to Eli for ruining their perfect season run
That's pretty cold, but at least Eli will have a legacy when all is said and done
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the New England Patriots?
No. I hate that team?
But why? They are such an amazing team. Name one team in recent memory that has been as dominant as they've been.
I don't care if they win a lot, I still don't like them.
Is it because you don't like Brady?
Not just Brady. Belichick and the whole organization are just a bunch of dirty cheats.
Oh, you're still on about that Deflate Gate scandal aren't you?
Yes, that whole team is full of cheats and they all need to be banned from the NFL.
You do realize they actually won another Super Bowl after that whole scandal blew over.
So? What's that have to do with anything.
It means that despite what people would like to say, a few under-inflated balls was not the reason the Patriots were so good.
But it was still an unfair advantage!
That's the other thing, if a ball was under-inflated during a game, wouldn't both sides get the same advantage since they play with the same ball?
Yes, that's technically true.
So then how does one side get a huge unfair advantage if they are both throwing the same ball?
Okay, so even if they didn't get some huge advantage or cheat, I still don't like them!
Now you are just being stubborn.
No, I just refuse to jump on the Patriots bandwagon along with everyone else.
What bandwagon? I've been a Patriots fan since they were getting trounce back in the 90s.
Well maybe you're a true fan, but most people are just jumping on the bandwagon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited for the superbowl this year.
I am too but do not rush it that fast.
Yeah I cannot wait to watch the season first.
Do you know the future sites where the superbowl will be held.
2018 will be held in Vikings football dome.
Yeah I knew that one.
2019 will be in the Atlanta Falcons dome.
I like that dome it is nice.
Yeah I think it is neat how the NFL does it in different places.
I do too.
2020 will be in Miami Dolphins dome.
I bet they are excited for that.
2021 will be in Los angelos but i am not sure what team that is.
Isn't that the raiders?
I thought but I think it is the rams.
Oh yeah it is the los angelos rams.
They have to make sure their building is suitable.
what do you mean.
their domes and stadiums have to meet certain expectations.
yeah that is understandble.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello, how are you doing today?
I am good, just bored out of my mind!
You will not not be that way for long, the NFL is right around the corner!
I know, I am desperate for some football in the worst way!
You are a big Cowboys fan, right?
No way! I have always been a Miami Dolphins fan!
That is right, I just got my wires crossed a little bit.
What team do you cheer for?
I do not have a particular team, I just follow the NFL as a whole.
Do you have any predictions for Miami this year?
Well I feel they have a lot of potential to really climb the ladder this season.
Thanks, I sure hope you are right about that!
Making the playoffs last year was a big step in the right direction for that franchise.
I thought so as well, I just hope this season proves that to be true.
Having Ndamukong Suh has really bolstered the Dolphins' defense.
I know, I was really excited when we got him from the Lions.
He has the reputation of being a dirty player; but he is effective.
I feel that every team needs a guy like that in order to really thrive.
You could be right about that actually.
I feel he is the best defensive tackle in the NFL today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the strict tackling rules for the NFL?
Man, I wish they would just let them play football.
Don't you care about the safety of the players?
Well of course I do, but they get paid a lot of money to get hit.
And a lot of them die in their 50's because of it.
Honestly, that's the price you pay.
That's cold man.
Maybe, but the league is so soft now with all these anti-tackling rules.
Like what?
The players used to be able to lead with their helmet and hit "defenseless" players.
So you think it's a bad thing that they can't anymore?
Maybe, I think it takes the excitement out of the game.
I can see that somewhat, but I think the players safety far outweighs that.
I get where you're coming from, but don't you miss big hits too?
I do, I really do.
Wouldn't you want to see them come back.
To an extent I guess, I don't want dead players either.
That risk is always there.
True, but there's no need to maximize it right?
I guess so, I just miss it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like between the Seahawks and Panthers?
The Seahawks
What makes them better?
They have a better QB and defense
They do have a very good defense
The Panthers have a lot of talent, but I do not see them getting too far
The Cowboys are probably better this year
Yes, they have a lot more talent than the Panthers too
So do you think Cowboys and Seahawks will be the match up?
No, I think there will be an unknown team this year.
Which one?
I think the 49ers are gonna surprise people
Interesting
They have too good of a team and they are ready to take the next step
Are you a big fan of theirs?
Not really, but I am realistic
I don't known. I think the Packers have a better shot
I like them
They have a great all around team
Maybe Packers will play the Seahawks then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
he only time he looked ok is when we were running uptempo.
But the very next game when he was told to run Bill O'Brien's offense, he was not good at all.
I do give him credit for not turning the ball over.
Here is stats since being a pro.
Its nothing eye popping and nothing to write home to momma about.
Let me tell you, this signing is a Mike Devlin special as Giacomini played under him when he was with New York Jets.
Could he work out?
We're about to find out.
However, according to Pro Football Focus, Giacomini is a below-average pass blocker like Clark, allowing four sacks and 44.3 grade off 266 snaps on the field in 2016 (which included just five starts).
PFF also notes that in 2015, Giacomini's last season as a full starter, allowed 54 quarterback pressures compared to 67 in 2016 for Clark.
Overall, Giacomini seems to be more closer than an average pass blocker rather than Clark who is well below-average.
Not to mention that he has been riddled with back injuries through last season.
304-pound 31-year-old became available because the Jets cut him after last season.
i surely hope the Rookie pick up the playbook quick. Because this dude is just as bad as Clark. No thanks.
Foreman is terrible in pass protection.
he is not taking the starting job from L. Miller.
He will take snaps from Blue.
that's a possibility as well since Blue knows this offense better.
According to the Chron's Aaron Wilson, the Houston Texans have signed veteran tackle Breno Giacomini to a deal.
Could he be the answer at right tackle?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the AFC South?
They are probably the weakest division in the NFL currently. The funny thing is that if one team were able to get their act together, they could easily dominate the division like the Patriots dominate the NFC East.
Totally agree with that assessment. If the Texans were just able to fix their quarterback situation, I think that they'd not only win the AFC South for years, but that they would also become a legitimate Super Bowl contender.
What's crazy about Houston is that Bill O'Brien was hired because he's this supposed offensive genius and he's already gone through several different quarterbacks in his short time there.
Yeah, I can understand failing with Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer, but he should have been able to succeed with Brock Osweiler.
I disagree with you on that point. Brock Osweiler was inconsistent and was prone to throw interceptions.
True, but this is also the guy who briefly took over for Peyton Manning during the Denver Bronco's 2015 Super Bowl Season and defeated Tom Brady's Patriots, which clinched the team home field advantage throughout the playoffs.
Agree to disagree on that point. However, if Bill O'Brien is able to properly develop Deshaun Watson, Houston will have an amazing offense for years to come.
I really liked Watson when he was at Clemson and am rooting for him in the NFL. However, I think that they drafted him too high and gave up too much to get him.
Only time will tell. I'm also surprisingly bullish on Jacksonville this season.
Really? That franchise hasn't been good since it started during the mid-1990s.
I acknowledge that it's been terrible for the past decade, but they just fired Gus Bradley and have made a lot of big name acquisitions in free agency.
The Gus Bradley firing was well overdue. However, Doug Marrone seems like a terrible head coach replacement given his mediocre record as the head coach for the Buffalo Bills.
Jacksonville has built a great defense and just needs to get its act together on offense. I believe that Marrone's offensive mind coupled with first round draft pick Leonard Fournette will result in the team's improvement.
I think that you're being sanguine regarding Jacksonville for the 2017 NFL season. I would contend that the Indianapolis Colts are better positioned to do well this year.
While Andrew Luck is a very talented quarterback, he is way too banged up to lead the Colts to success this year.
You're forgetting the fact that just two years ago, they were in the AFC Championship game.
The key part of that phrase is "two years ago." They have a terrible offensive line and defense, which makes it way too difficult for Luck to unilaterally carry the team.
I think that between their weapons on offensive like Hilton and their decent head coach, they have a shot to contend for the AFC South.
I just think that apart from Luck, the rest of that team is a mess. Their owner is erratic and creates a culture of chaos for that team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you ready for NFL to start up?
Whoa, is it already that time of the year?
Well, not until September, but that's pretty close now!
Huh, I honestly hadn't been keeping track. Not after my team's performance last year.
Who's your team?
Carolina Panthers.
Oh. Ouch. Yeah, they haven't played well since they were in the Super Bowl.
Cam's still quite the rookie; he's either good or he's just bad.
That's true. And he's basically the only star player, I can't think of anyone else on the team.
Well, we got Julius Peppers on our defensive end. He's good in a pinch.
I forgot about him. Funny name, but a good player.
I'd like to think that this is the year we get our act together, but I won't hold my breath.
In the meantime, I can always count on my team!
Oh, please tell me you're not a Patriots fan.
You know it! Tom Brady is the man.
I'm so ready for him to retire already.
You're just jelly because we win all the time.
And cheat, Mr. DeflateGate! And get away with it!
Okay, I will admit that his punishment was a little light.
If a little light means they didn't even barely slap him on the hand, then yes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
are you going to any football games this year?
im thinking about it.
they are so expensive!
yes they are!
how can you afford to go?
my neighbor has season tickets and invites me sometimes.
where does she have season tickets to?
the atlanta falcons.
how do you think they will do this year?
im hoping for the best.
didnt they go to the super bowl last year?
no, that was the seahawks.
isnt that the same thing?
no, its a different bird.
well, i guess ill be rooting for them for you.
i appreciate it.
will you take me with you if they go to the superbowl?
if they actually win, i will.
ok, bet.
bet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe the preseason is only a month away?
I know! I am so excited.
Do you think this will be the Packers year?
Man, I think every year is going to be the Packers year.
They keep making it to the playoffs, though. I'd be pretty happy.
Yeah, but at the same time, it's hard to watch them lose when they are so close.
That would suck. Hasn't it been like 7 seasons in a row that they have made the playoffs?
I think so. Patriots and Packers are on the same streak.
That is pretty crazy. Aaron Rodgers is pretty dominate.
Yeah, it's hard to tell what the problem is anymore. Everyone blames the coaching, but I don't know.
Yeah, it is hard to argue against anyone when they keep making it to the playoffs.
But the Patriots have won 2 in the past few years and the Packers win was like 7 years ago.
Still, I would rather be in that position than not making the playoffs at all!
I know. Being a Packers fan has spoiled me a little.
I am pretty excited to see what the Raiders can do.
Hopefully Carr is healthy. He was dominate there for awhile.
He really was. And now they have Lynch!
They are going to be a team to look out for.
I just hope they live up to the hype.
I really think they will. Good luck to both teams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know the NFL has been around for almost 100 years?
Wow, really?
Yep, formed in 1920.
So in 2020 it's 100 years!
Yep, isn't that amazing?
Yeah, although it makes sense cause it feels like the NFL has always been around.
I mean, it has for us!
I wonder what the first games were like.
Probably different in what they are now, but with the same rules.
Nah, I feel like rules would change as time goes on.
Why do you think that?
Well, birth of technology, emergence of illegal tactics....
Oh yeah, like steriods.
Exactly, I'm sure the game has evolved a lot.
And the teams!
I would've loved to watch a game in it's first season.
Me too, and the first Superbowl!
I wonder if any videos survive of it.
Probably, I know a lot of pictures probably are saved.
Now I'm just gonna look at a bunch of them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Shayne what's going on with you today?
I'm just hanging at my pops watching some football tape, you wanna come over?
Oh definitely man, you watching any teams in particular?
You know I have to catch my Dolphins man!
Oh right you are a Florida boy before a California boy, even though you live in California.
I can't root for a team just because I like them?
Of course you can, it is just weird to like a team that doesn't represent the place you live.
I honestly just used to watch Dan Marino all the time and that inspired me to watch the modern era.
That is cool, I completely understand having legends inspire.
It is the same with any sport, I still follow the Bulls because of Jordan.
Good point, let's watch some Dolphins and classic Titans tape.
You mean the Tennessee Titans?
Oh definitely man, I am from California but I always loved the McNair and George combination!
Eddie George was  a quick and savage monster.
I agree man, in his hay day he was an absolute beast.
And you remember McNair was incredible in NFL Blitz?
That was the best game of all time!
I have an old PlayStation, we can actually play it!
Football and Blitz, classic day.
It'll be fun, see you soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are your favorite NFL announcers of all time? They don't necessarily need to be current.
Well, I have a special place in my heart of John Madden. He sort of opened up color commentary to a whole new level of fun and insight.
Yeah, he was a total natural. He combined great insight and humor, like you were alluding to.
I would have to say that currently I do like Al Michaels and Chris Collinsworth. I think they are the best tandem and I will tune into games they play just to hear them call the game.
I think that's a first. I don't know if I've ever heard of anyone tune into an NFL game just to hear the commentators.
Well, yeah, it's hard to explain why they are so good. I think they have a chemistry that few can match.
There are other teams that are just as smart or provide good analysis, but I agree, they just have a certain synergy together that is unparalleled.
I completely agree. If we are talking all-time greats, you can't forget Howard Cosell.
Naturally and no doubt. Such a wordsmith -- and that voice and New York accent. Pure genius!
Yes, and he called perhaps the saddest game of all-time, a Monday night game when John Lennon passed away.
Oh, yes, I remember that, he was very classy about how he handled that situation.
Not to switch gears too much but what ever happened to Brent Musburger? He was so good!
Yeah, I don't know myself. He brought a certain sort of calm, analytical professionalism to the games he called.
Yeah, and for awhile there in the 80's, he was THE announcer when CBS ruled sports broadcasting.
I'm not exactly sure what happened to him, perhaps he was phased out due to old age.
In terms of some of the newer announcers, I sort of like Jon Gruden. He was this macho swagger that I sort of like.
Yeah, it's kinda like a military drill sargent calling a game. I think he's an acquired taste, but I think for most football fans, he's a good fit.
I know this is a "hot take" -- sort of -- but I like Joe Buck. I know I'm probably in the minority here, but I think he's professional and calls a good game.
Yeah, I think you lost me with that one. I'm waiting for him to retire. I think he said he's going to move on at a point in the not so distant future.
Overall, I think the sport has a number of good announcers and good announcing teams. It's a good time to be a fan!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite football weather?
I love watching NFL games when it's snowing.
Why snow?
It makes everything more exciting.
How is snow exciting?
It makes it more difficult. So the professionals make more mistakes.
That makes sense. I didn't think about that.
What about you? What is your favorite?
My favorite time to watch an NFL game is in the rain. It also makes it more exciting.
Both rain and snow can make the field and ball slippery.
I think regular weather football is exciting, but there is just something about football in the rain.
Or in the snow.
Yeah! Or the snow.
I hope we get to see some exciting weather games this season.
Yeah, me too. I want at least three of them
If we get lucky there might be at least one.
I guess one special game is better than zero.
Who do you think is the best team in the rain?
That's an interesting question.
Well?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You pumped about less penalties for celebrations?
Oh yeah. It'll be way better. How about you?
Yeah, it's the best way forward. I always feel bad when they throw penalties just for celebrating.
Agreed. It's ridiculous.
And you know Marshawn's still going to get a penalty for some sort of celebration.
For sure. That will be worth it, though. I'm glad he's back.
Me, too. Oakland may just devastate folks this year.
It's possible.
I hope so, at least.
Yeah, I'd like to see them succeed.
What do you think Dak will look like this year?
Cowboys? He'll be good. Really good. Now. As good as last year? I'm not sure. He'll have a harder time, that's for sure.
Yeah. I think he'll do good. Just not as successful. It's just so much harder once defenders really start looking at the tape.
Yeah. And also. Now he's the man. It's just different for the players. To try to bring down the big man. You know, just a bigger famous QB to talk about you sacking?
Yup. It's good times, ahead. Still though, I don't think the Cowboys go deep in the playoffs.
Agreed. Who do you have in the Superbowl?
Man. Hate to say it. Because I hate them. Patriots. Maybe Patriots and Tampa.
Tampa? Man, I think you're dreaming a little now.
Maybe, but that's what I'd like to see.
Me. I want bang-bang. Maybe Steelers and Oakland. That would be good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite player on the Carolina Panthers?
Cam Newton is a funny and talented guy.
Yeah he is also really kind to his fans.
I was really rooting for them during their perfect season.
I wish they won Superbowl 50.
At least Peyton Manning ended his career with a highlight.
Yeah some players never win a Superbowl he got to win two.
One with the Colts and one with the Broncos.
Did you know he is the only Quarterback to reach the Superbowl with four different coaches?
That is something he should be proud of.
Yeah it's so hard to get to the Superbowl in the first place.
You have to do so much to get there then it all comes down to one game.
It isn't fair in some ways.
Sometimes you wonder if they should do a best-of-3 or best-of-5 series.
That would be cool if you kept every game single elimination except for the Superbowl.
Think of how different some of the previous Superbowls would have been.
The results may have been completely different.
Honestly maybe changing something that works is a bad idea.
Good point Football is already very popular.
I am so excited for next season!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XVIII.
Who played in that one?
The Los Angeles Raiders against the Washington Redskins.
Where was it played?
Tampa Stadium.
Who did the broadcast?
Pat Summerall and John Madden.
Who did the halftime show?
There was a salute to superstars of the silver screen.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Jim Plunkett for the Raiders and Joe Theismann for the Redskins.
Who was leading at the half?
The Raiders, 21-3.
What was the final score?
38-9, Raiders.
Who was the MVP?
Marcus Allen.
How did the bookies do?
Washington was favored by three.
I 'm glad an old AFL team won.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite sport again?
I love basketball, but nothing can top the NFL in my book.
I agree! It is the best thing on television in my opinion.
I have very fond memories of watching games with my grandpa when I was little.
I know what you mean, I always watched them with my dad.
Me and grandpa always debated about who the NFL's best running back was.
Did you guys debate about the best of all time?
Yes, we probably had the same debate over and over for years.
Who would you say is the best running back in NFL history?
In my opinion, nobody can touch Barry Sanders!
Barry sure was fun to watch, I will give you that one.
My grandpa always said the best ever was Jim Brown.
A lot of people who watched in those days say the same thing about Brown.
Yea, I understand he was great, but Sanders could not hardly even be tackled!
While we are talking about great running backs, I have to throw in Walter Payton's name.
I feel he is the second best running back ever, with Brown coming in at third.
It sure is a tough debate no matter how you slice it.
There is no denying that! Would you give the nod to Payton as the best ever?
Actually, I think I would call him the best one that I have ever seen.
All three of the guys we mentioned are legends without a doubt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the Redskins will have a good year this upcoming season?
They should certainly be competitive
Do you think that they will win their division?
They certainly have a chance. All the teams are just about even across the board
I like that the Redskins got Terrelle Pryor and DJ Swearinger in free agency
Yes. They are both very good players and will be starters
Their season will certainly rest on the shoulders of Kirk Cousins
Cousins will certainly have to have a big season if he expects the team to sign him to a big contract
The NFC East is going to be tough. The Eagles are being heralded as the favorites.
It is because they done real good in free agency as well this offseason
Who were some of the players they signed?
LaGarrette Blount, Torrey Smith, Jeremy Maclin, Alshon Jeffrey
Their offense then should be very good.
Yes it will. Plus, it will be another year for Carson Wentz to mature.
The Cowboys should be good as well.
The only problem with Dallas is that their defense is lacking.
The Cowboys offense should be just as good as last year.
Prescott and Elliot will certainly be the key. It is just their defense is going to be their obvious weakness
You certainly cannot forget the Giants.
If Eli can keep the interceptions down, the Giants could certainly be in contention.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man, did you catch the NFL draft?
Yeah, I caught parts of it, they had some interesting picks here and there.
Oh, anyone in particular you thought was a good choice?
Well, again, only caught part of it, but I think  Solomon Thomas for the 49ers might be a good choice.
Yeah, could be, he seems pretty versatile Only thing I find odd about him as pick is they already got decent defense men.
Well, you can never have too many defensemen as long as you're not neglecting the other areas you'll need.
Yeah, that's true.
What about you?  What picks did you find interesting?
I thought Joe Williams was a good pick, myself.
Oh, missed that part.. where did he get picked up from?
Utah.  He's got a pretty record with speed he's got like 1,407 yards on 210 carries.
Oh, not bad!  That'll be good for dodging tackles and whatnot.
Yeah, that's what i was thinking.  Did you remember any other picks you got?
Well, not sure about "good" but definitely notable...  Reuben Foster.
I think I heard about him.. did he fail a drug test?
Yeah, that's what I meant about concerns, but lot of his teammates support his character so, the result could have been a false positive.
Well, it's not like there no drugs in the NFL... I mean, if you took out everyone I bet half the teams would have to stay home.
Yeah, that's true, but from what I understand, the guy was really sought after, even got a A+ rating from Niner's wire online.
Wow, they're awfully pick about who they get anything above a "B" to.
So I've been told.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for NFL football to start back.
I am, when does pre-season start back again?
NFL pre season games will start in August.
Who is your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowbys are one of my favorite teams in the NFL.
How did they do last year?
Dallas had a magical season last year winning 13 games and getting the bye in the playoffs.
What was different abou the season?
Dallas started Dak Prescott and he was a phenominal quarterback.
Where did he come from.
Dak played at Mississippi State University and had an oustanding career there.
Is Dak returning this year to Dallas?
Dak was named offensive rookie of the year and went to the probowl so I think he will start for sure this year.
How did they do in the playoffs with Dak Prescott?
They played a great game but lost a close game to Green Bay.
I bet that was disheartening for the fans after having such a great year.
Yes it was disappointing for Dallas to lose the first game in the playoffs.
What happened to the other Dallas Quarterback?
Romo got injured and Prescott took over with a fury!
I am excited to see what the Dallas Cowboys do this season in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey mom did you by chance see my blue button up I always wear?
I haven't seen it recently no.
I really need it today, I am going to my high school reunion.
Oh than I will surely help you look, I want you to look nice.
Thank you mom, I am excited to see some old friends.
Are you gonna see any girls you missed your chance on?
I hope so, and I want to see my old football buddies.
You had so many friends that came over back then to watch the games.
There is a Seahawks game today, I may invite a few people over.
That is such a coincidence, I was reading today that former Seahawk went to your high school.
A player went to Hamilton, who was it?
I think his name was Warren something..
Warren Sapp?
No, it was Warren Moon!
Oh yeah, he was a great player.
It was just cool seeing that someone famous went to your school.
That is cool, Shia Labeouf went to my school too!
Impressive!
Anyways I am gonna get going.
See you later for the game son, I love you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think the panthers will bounce back this season?
cam newton and them?
yeah.
cam had his turn, and he blew it.
new season, everybody's undefeated.
man, the panthers ain't making no noise this season.
i think they are.
tampa bay gone have that division on lock.
tampa bay?
you heard me.
man, you smoking something. the bucs are doo-doo.
naw my dude. this winston's third season.
what that mean?
last year they went 9-7 and didn't get in. this year they get in.
what that got to do with this being winston's third season?
didn't it take cam newton three seasons to make the playoffs?
i don't know.
well like i said, the bucs gone get in this year.
what that got to do with the panthers?
tampa bay gone win that division. panther's ain't getting no wildcard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do the Bills play the first week of the season?
They play the Jets.
I'm going to get tickets to that game.
Can I go with you?
Of course.
I think they'll do better this year.
I hope so, seven wins isn't very good.
The season started so well too.
That's life when you are a Bills Fan.
Yea, losing four Super Bowls in a row is tough.
They had some good teams back then though.
Jim Kelly was a great quarterback.
Flutie wasn't bad either.
Thurman Thomas was amazing too.
I miss those days.
I think we're on the way back up though.
Not until we get a quarterback.
Well, that is an issue.
I think we lose 12 games this year.
I hope not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you going to watch the Chiefs and the Patriots game?
Probably so, when is it?
September 7th
Oh..where are they playing?
Gillette Stadium!  I wanted to get tickets.
I don't know, I'm not a huge fan of the Chiefs.
Me neither, but the Patriots are awesome.
Well they're both good teams, I just don't like watching the Chiefs.
Why not?
I'm not a fan of Alex Smith.
Oh, I don't even know who he is.
He's their passing yard.
Oh.  That's Tom Brady for the Patriots.
Yeah, I like him a lot better.
He is a great player!  I think he does better than that Smith guy.
Well his stats are definitely much better.  He had almost twice as many touchdowns last season.
Wow, that's impressive.
I wonder what new players they will have this year.
I don't know.  I'm hoping to find out at the game.
Well maybe I will watch it after all.  I don't know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I had a dream last night about watching NFL football.
Well that's all we got right now since the season hasn't started.
I'm thinking of trying to go to a game this year.
Where would you go?
I like the Bears, but I'd be open to anywhere really.
You must really want to attend a game.
I do.  I used to have season tickets to the Bears and I miss those Sundays tailgating and going into the game.
That sounds like a fun way to spend a Sunday.
I do enjoy being home too though to watch NFL games.
That NFL Redzone Channel is great to watch parts of all the games.
I know you don't really miss a touchdown on that channel.
Now you're getting me excited to watch my team the Steelers.
I didn't know you were a Steelers fan.
I've liked them for awhile.  I liked Antonio Brown and their running back.
You talking about LeVeon Bell?
Yes I couldn't remember his name.  He is a great runner.
He is very explosive.
Antonio Brown can move too.
Yeah he just runs by defenseive backs and Big Ben drops the ball in.
See why I like the Steelers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember the good old days of NFL Monday Night Football!
The good old days?
With the incomparable Howard Cosell!
Oh, yeah!
And Frank Gifford!
Kathy Lee Gifford's husband?
That's right!
I love Kathy Lee!
And Dandy Don Merrideth!
Dandy?
Yeah. Dandy DOn Merrideth!
You cheer for a dandy Don?
No, Dandy Don is the nickname for the announcer.
Dandy?  Was he a special announcer?
Yeah. He was awful!
THen why did they call him dandy?
He was a great football player before he became an announcer. Dandy was a term of respect and admiration for his skills on the ball field...not his skills in the announcer's booth.
I just never would have thought that all those roughnecks on the playing field would nick name someone "Dandy"!
It's true. Dandy Don!
Dandy Don. Did they have a Pretty Paul too?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How is it that Ryan Fitzpatrick scored so high yet he sucks?
Fitzpartick went to Harvard.
Whoa, what?
yep. he was a math major at Harvard.
But Harvard doesn't have a football team do they?
Of course they do! They play in the IVY league. And they don't have a football scholarship, so people who play for Harvard got into Harvard got in on their academnic merit.
Whoa dude. I wonder how many Harvard football players end up in NFL then
Not many.
How many though>Are they any good?
Fitzpartick is pretty good. I mean he's not the worst.
So one?
There are others. Cameron Brate, TE for the buccs. He'll be a good target for Winston.
He's ok. Not that good as a TE. Who else?
Let's see... Oh yeah Desmon BRyant
No way, Desmond Bryant played for the Crimson?
yep. And let's see whoelse. Oh Yeah. Kyle Juszczyk
The big fullback for bills?
he's with 49ers now
Wait, that's our team, why did we get him?
Maybe he's worth it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up with the Chiefs this year?
Not really sure what you mean by that statement.
Seems like they are a team in transistion.
I don't know, they're pretty solid.
It seems like Alex Smith just can't catch a break.
He's the ultimate bus driver quarterback.
Extremely solid and unspectacular all at once.
You can win a super bowl like that, but have to give him a good supporting cast.
I really like that fast guy they drafted.
Tye Hill?
Yeah, that dude stole the show last year.
He was a one man highlight.  Probably the fastest player in the NFL.
He's a real weapon for them and a great NFL pick.
It will also be interesting how they develop at QB going forward.
Yeah, they burned a high pick on a QB, right?
Traded up to get that guy from Texas Tech.
He's probably a year away from starting I think.
But the writing is on the wall for Alex Smith: you ain't the future.
They might make wild card if they're lucky, but that division is a killer.
I think they'll be bumped out of the playoffs this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Only a little over a month before the NFL season starts. Are you excited?
I am so excited. It seems like a really long time since the season ended.
I know. I'm even looking forward to the pre-season games which are always bad.
Ha ha! I know what you mean. I'll be watching pre-season also.
Who do you think is going to be really improved this year?
I really don't know. It sounds the the KC Chiefs are looking strong and maybe the Houston Texans since they got rid of Osweiler.
Oh I forgot about Osweiler. I wonder what he's doing now.
He's competing for a starting position with the Cleveland Browns.
That's right. The Texans traded him and lost big bucks.
Yes, and now the Browns are paying big bucks for a random quarterback.
I wonder why they traded for him. He was so lousy last year.
Because he came with a second round draft pick. I read that the Browns wanted the second rounder and Osweiler was just thrown in as an extra.
Yes but why would they want to keep him.
They put him on the market but no one was interested so they kept him on to see how he played before pre-season starts. They have to pay him so they may as well see what he can do.
Hopefully this will teach him some humility.
Yeah, that was his biggest problem. He thought he was better than what he was. People learn so he can too.
Do they still have Robert Griffin III? He's gone, isn't he?
Yes, they released him. I'm not sure if anyone picked him up. He's been hurt so much during his career, it's probably over.
That's too bad. Of him and Andrew Luck, I liked RG3 better.
Same here. I hope he heals up and plays again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like most about the game of football?
That's a really hard question because there are a lot of elements that are really engaging.
If you had to pick one, what would it be?
I think I would say that I really like the physical contact the most.
Big hits are always entertaining.
Not just big hits, but even just two large men trying to push each other around.
A lot of injuries result from those big hits though.
A lot of injuries happen without big hits too.
Most of the injuries I see are the result of some type of hit or tackle.
When you see a player injured in baseball or basketball is it because they got tackled?
No, but players in those games aren't frequently receiving head injuries.
Would you say football players receive more head injuries than boxers?
I would actually have to look at some statistics on that, but I feel like boxers probably have more head injuries.
And Muhammad Ali is a pretty good example of how debilitating they can be.
It sounds like you're defending football injuries.
No, I'm not defending them.  I'm just stating the fact that many sports have frequent injuries.
So do you think the NFL should do more to protect players from injuries?
I think they should always be pushing for that, but you also have to realize that everyone involved with football knows how dangerous it is.
And yet many players are quite vocal about their love for the game.
Indeed, some things are so physically and mentally rewarding that they're worth the risk.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I sure like the potential for Carr with the Raiders!
I agree, he seems poised to be a great one.
He may already have passed Andrew Luck on the food chain.
Maybe, but I still prefer Luck.He did't close his atrocious offensive line, the newly fired GM, Greyson did!
Well, he certainly didn't do Andrew any favors.He is still young.He has amazing physical tools.
His stats are trending down.At one time, people would have taken him over Brady.
That was then..this is now!
Dak Prescott! Was he a one-hit wonder?
Well, he just got hemmed up in a fiasco with an autograph machine.
Poor decision! His people should have known better.If Prescott plays like he did last year for the Cowboys..
..They will need a Brinks Truck to carry away all his cash.No unnecessary distractions!
I think he is the "real deal". Jerry Jones, the Boys Owner, does as well, and he signs the paychecks!
Romo retired to the color booth.He got the message.
Yeah, Phil Simms got kicked from the top CBS broadcast team.
Phil HAD to go.He has been ragtime for years!
I agree and then some!
How about the Broncos.What do you think?
Well, i am not sure, but I think Andre Ware retired. They need more ballers.
I also like the potential of Houston, with a healthy Watt, and Brian Cushing.
It is still not enough to topple the Patriots.Let's not even talk about those cheaters!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team?
The Dallas Cowboys are my favorite.
That seems to be a common answer.
They are called America's team.
They are doing good now.
Yeah, they were bad for a while.
I like their running back.
Oh yeah, what's his name again?
His name is Ezekiel Elliott.
He's a very big and fast player.
They like giving him the ball alot.
If teams can't stop him, that's a good idea.
They have a good defense.
It's always good to not allow the other team to score much.
Some teams can't play any defense.
The Saints give up a ton of points a game,
They score a lot of points as well.
It doesn't matter because the other team scores more.
It's always a fun game to watch.
Yeah, I like high scoring games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm looking forward to seeing the New York Giants this season!
Yeah, they have a really good wide receiving corps, don't they?
Odell Beckham's gotta keep focused, if he can I can't see any other team that can match their wide receivers.
Brandon Marshall was a huge pickup.
Yeah, he knew he wasn't going anywhere near the playoffs, so he went to a team that has a good shot.
They'll be good, provided the offensive line can keep Manning protected.
That's the one big Giants weakness. Nobody on that offensive line can protect the quarterback.
It's time to end the Erick Flowers experiment, huh?
Yeah, he's a turnstile. I thought Will Beatty was bad, but sheesh Flowers is a bust.
Beatty got paid and decided that the big paycheck was good enough for him.
Yeah, if the Giants could have upgraded in the draft, I think they may be a Super Bowl contender.
Who did they pick?
They took a tight end in the first round. I didn't like the pick.
Could he at least block?
No, he was more known for being a pass catching tight end in college.
Oh, so no Jake Ballard/Kevin Boss type that can do both?
Nope, sometimes I think Reese just can't evaluate certain kinds of players that well.
With the NFC East like it is right now, the Giants have to be strong, he's gotta be on the hot seat.
I imagine if they miss the playoffs this season, he's gone.
A shame since he did help build some of those championship teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is the best QB in the league?
Man, tough decision.  Tons of good ones to choose from.
You must have a favorite though.
Well, I'll have to go with Tom Brady.
I said best though.
I know you did.  I'd still go with Tom Brady.
The guy is like 40 years old now.
But he's still winning Super Bowls.  He would have been MVP last year if he had played all year.
I'm not saying he's not a great QB, but not sure he'd be my pick.
Alright then, who would you take?
I would probably go with Aaron Rodgers.
You could make an argument for him.
I don't really need to make an argument.  He's probably the most talented QB in the NFL.
His arm strength and accuracy is good no doubt.
He basically beat the Cowboys on his own.
If that's the condition you use, why not go Brady though?
Because Brady's talent seems to be mostly in his head, not his body.
That's a really dumb argument.
All I'm saying is if I'm choosing a QB, I'll go with Rodgers.
And me Brady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for football season?
Hell yeah. Raiders are going to win it all this year!
Why do you think that?
They would have won it all last year if not for Carr's injury.
Still would have been tough to get by the Patriots.
True, but we also upgraded in the off-season, especially at RB.
Yeah, I'm excited to see Beast Mode back in action.
The entire NFL has to worry about the Raiders.
Still, I like the Patriots over them.
We'll see what happens in the playoffs.
The Cowboys will be tough too.
Let's see if Prescott is the real deal.
I think he proved he is last season and so did Elliott.
I'm still not a believer.
I also think Carolina can return to Super Bowl contenders this season.
It all falls on Newton's shoulders.
Yeah, he just didn't have it last year for some reason.
I think he'll bounce back this season.
Any team that you think will be a big surprise?
I think the Titans and Bucs could be playoff teams this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think NFL football is too violent?
Well, hard contact is what appeals to many fans--that's the game.
But what about the concussion issue?
Very serious, obviously.
And the concern for injury is trickling down.
I read that high school fooball participation is down.
Yes, over a million high schoolers still play, but there seems to be a downward trend.
That has to concern the NFL.
For sure--that's where the future players and fans come from.
Is the NFL doing anything about it?
Well, as you know there have been rule changes.
Yes, specifically penalizing the helmet to helmet hit on defenseless players.
And protecting the quarterback.
Can they do anything about the helmets?
Well, yes, there has been a lot of research to develop safer helmets.
But it's still a violent game--if you limit the violence, can the NFL survive?
I think a less violent game would deter many fans.
Yeah, what would be the attendance for a flag football game?
It's a tough situation.
It will be interesting to see how it plays out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so excited for NFL football to get here!
Me too, it seems like it's been gone forever.
There's a lot of good storylines in the NFL this year, what are you watching?
So much, as always, the Patriots will probably win it all.
They're the worst!
Yeah, but no matter what, they have to be the favorites.
Marshawn Lynch with the Raiders is also an interesting one to watch.
Yeah, that's a match made in heaven: crazy and crazy.
It's always fun to see the rookies that surprise you.
My dark horse for rookie of the year is Derek Barnett.
Garrett got all the press, but Barnett was more productive against top competition.
Plus, the Browns are a mess, while the Eagles have some players.
I'm also excited to watch Trubisky crash and burn.
He was overdrafted for sure.
Who's your preseason MVP pick?
Hard not to pick Brady, but wouldn't shock me if it was Matt Ryan.
Yeah, last year could be the stepping stone on the way to greatness for the Falcons or the high point.
Time will tell.
I'm picking the Cowboys to win it all this year.
Bold pick, we'll see if they have enough experience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the Best QB in the NFL?
Hmmm.  I'm going with Brady because of that comeback.
Good choice, although I think he's a little over the hill and Rodgers or Ryan might be better now.
Yeah they're all lights out.  I can see either one of them.
Yeah, Ryan hasn't done it year in and year out though.
I hear you.  Last year he was boss, but Rodgers every year is awesome.
You know who's not elite but overlooked?  Stafford.
Oh man heck yeah.  He always has good numbers but his team can't seem to win.
Not consistently at least.  Plus us seems to make bad decisions in the playoffs.
That seems to be the same for lots of guys.  Like Andy Dalton.
I agree, Dalton is really good.
He had an off year though.
You know who's over rated?  Flaco.
Yes!  He's what I would call above average.
Same with Wilson.
Yeah, good enough to stay, but can't carry a team.
Not like Rodgers, or Brady.
Yeah, Eli too.
I knew you would say that you Giants fan.
Have to remind you every once in a while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what team do you think is favorite for this NFL season?
I think that theres no clear favorite yet but the Patriots are always in the fight.
I dont know, it seems unlikely to win the Superbowl two times in a row
Yeah its hard and dont think many teams have done that but it would be great.
Actually theres 7 teams that have that, no team has won 3 in a row though.
Oh that fact is interesting I thought the number was way smaller.
So do you like any other teams for this season?
Well I always liked the Broncos but generally I just like to watch the games without a favorite, what about you?
I like the Steelers, since I was a child I liked them.
And do you know it they recruited any interesting players this season?
Yeah theres actually a few interesting players im exited to watch this season.
Oh I see, looks like you really know about football.
Well I do like it a lot and plus I play a lot of Madden that helps!
Im not much of a video game person myself but Ive heard its a great game.
Yeah I like it because you can use different teams and alter their tactics.
Sounds like a lot of work, do you also use the Steelers in that game?
Yeah I use them all the time I just like all about that team.
You really are passionate about that team!
I am, hopefully theyll win this season althought theres a lot of good teams this year.
Yeah the competition is hard but we will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL team do you think has the best mascot?
Whatever the Colts mascot is called seems to be pretty entertaining to watch
I do always see him behind the end zone during games reacting to plays on the field
That's what mascots are supposed to do to entertain people, even if the mascot itself isn't all that interesting
Didn't the Jaguars' mascot parachute into the stadium once?
Someone did, and I would put it past Jaxson to do something like that
Florida's teams have pretty cool mascots, like the Buccaneers guy who is literally just a pirate
And it's too bad the Dolphins don't use a real dolphin as a mascot, but I suppose that wouldn't be a great idea
Remember the Seahawks' live hawk that landed on someone's head before a game?
I wouldn't expect a dolphin to do something like that, but I get your point
The Ravens have a pretty cool mascot named after Edgar Allan Poe
That makes sense, since he wrote The Raven and both the team and mascot are based on that
There used to be three mascots named Edgar, Allan, and Poe, but now there's just Poe
I wonder why they did that, but I imagine it saved money and was easier to manage
Do the Green Bay Packers have a mascot, or is it just cheese?
I think the fans are the mascot, since the team is community-owned
They don't have cheerleaders either, if I remember right
Well some people might argue that NFL cheerleaders don't really serve a purpose
They do a lot of work in the community, though, so I still think it's a good idea to have them
And I'm sure the NFL is glad to have people who will help sell merchandise, if nothing else
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why hast Kaepernick been signed yet?
Thats a question we wont ever answer!
Why not?
Because he isnt that good I guess.
I think the league is racist
Now thats a terrible take.
Why is Glennon getting money but he cant get a backup job?
Glennon hasnt shown that he is terrible.
Not yet.
Right, so you pay for potential
And Kap?
He has shown he cant handle an offense.
He was in the Super Bowl
Yeah with a great defense.
Running QB can succeed in todays game.
Sure they can but they wont
Why do you say that?
The beating they take is too hard.
Yeah but they are use to it
No conditioning will withstand that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo! How are the Ravens looking this season?
Pretty good, pretty good.
I'm ready for the season to start. It's been too long.
Yeah, I know. They need to add two more games, if you ask me.
Tell me about it. Or at least make the playoffs longer.
Yeah, I could dig that too.
Who do you think an underdog is this year?
I don't know, but I think the Falcons are gonna be worse than last year.
Yeah, me too, actually. I think the Panthers take that division.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
They say Cam's not going to run as much.
Yeah. He needs to calm down with that.
He needs to become a pocket passer. That would suit them well.
They don't have any receivers though.
That's true. They need someone to step up.
You know who else looks good? The Patriots.
Oh yeah, definitely.
I think they're gonna win it all.
I wouldn't be surprised. Their pick ups this offseason have been nuts.
Yes indeed. Gonna great a great season for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is going to be interesting to see who challenges New England this year. Someone has to step it up.
They are in an easy division. They are already in the playoffs.
There were some teams that had down years in the AFC last year that will probably do better this year.
Like who?
The Colts and the Steelers are good teams.
Colts have no offensive line. Andrew Luck is one hit away from being Steve Young.
What about the Steelers?
Ben is getting old and a shadow of his former self.
There is still the NFC, Green Bay, Dallas and Seattle are all good competition.
Green Bay puts up points but it has a suspect defense New England will take them apart.
Well in Dallas the quarterback controversy is over so they can focus on winning now.
Dak is a second year quarterback do you like your odds against five time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady.
What about the fact that Seattle still has the Legion of Boom to stop Brady.
How did work out last time they played them in the Super Bowl.
Are you one of those people who actually believes that the deflater was talking about losing weight?
A kid did a science fair project about it and he proved the science where it could have deflated naturally.
Now you are just being naive. I suppose it doesn't bother you that Roger Gooddell destroyed all the Spygate evidence.
Competitive advantage every team cheats a little bit.
How come they are team we are always talking about in the controversy. It is not because they are better than everyone else it is because they cheat more effectively.
Haters gonna hate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think Gonk is going to do this year.
I hope he stays healthy.
Watch out if he does he is a heck of a offensive weapon.
He adds an extra dimension to a already great offense.
When he is the second tight end watch out.
Yeah the Patriots have so much to choose from they are hard to defend.
Did you know he's the highest paid tight end in the league.
Yeah, Brady takes pay cuts to keep guys like him around to make the team stronger.
Smart move with him in there it keeps Tom healthy and he doesn't get hit as much
That's another secret to his longevity.
I think Gronk has a couple more seasons in him if he stays healthy.
That's the tough part when you are a huge target and your job is to run over people if you have to.
I love to see him do it and then slam the ball though.
Have you heard the controversy about his logo though.
No what's that about.
Some basketball player is complaining that he stole his logo
You mean the silhouette of him slamming the ball down on apparel and stuff
It was pretty similar though.
And he's also said Goodel wouldn't be welcome in Foxborough too.
Can't blame him for that.  I hate Goodell too.  Who doesn't
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dez Bryant is an amazing receiver.
He is amazing.
I hope he stays away from injuries this season.
Yes, that's tough to do but I like his talent.
He keeps the fans on their toes.
Also, he keeps the players on their toes.
He has speed and determination.
I would love to see him play in person.
That would be incredible.
Do you think that their will be some great rookies this year?
Yes, indeed.
Who are you looking out for?
I hear that DeShaun Watson is going to really provide a solid game.
He's quite a player.
Also, Dalvin Cook will help the Vikings I bet.
Wow, sound like they have it made.
The rookies always add some spice to the game.
I don't know how the rookies do it
It must be tough, but they sure work hard.
They are good at showing what they've got.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest receiver in NFL history?
Jerry Rice is on the top of my list.
I agree with you that is a good one.  Anyone else in contention?
What about Lynn Swann?
He was great for the Steelers in the 1970s.
I enjoyed watching the acrobatic catches when I was a kid.
I knew him well because of that.
Anyone else come to mind?
What about Randy Moss?
Randy was great but I guess he is just old enough yet.
What do you think of Terrell Owens?
Terrell Owens was a great receiver but there were always drama issues.
I think the press hounded him too much.
He brought it on himself with all the antics instead of just playing the game.
Still, I think he deserves a place in the Hall of Fame.
He did change the direction of any team he played for.
What about Michael Irvin?
He has got to be up there on the list.
The Dallas teams in the 1990s dominated.
He was a big part of that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do think about the Raiders this year?
Oh wow, I am not sure
I think if Carr can stay healthy they have a real shot
I agree actually.
That D is just unreal
I know! Its brutally though
Speaking of tough have you seen their schedule?
I know!
And they are on TV a ton.
Really? I hadn't known that.
I think its like 4 times?
What, no way.
I think so
And of course they are moving to Las Vegas
That has nothing to do with anything.
No but it might be on their minds
I guess.
Needless to say its going to be a great year I hope.
Raider nation back!
I sure hope so
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL football is my favorite sport
What do you like about it?
I love throwing my support behind a team.
What do you like about the sport?
I love how organized it is and how at any moment a big pass or big run can happen.
I agree those are thrilling moments.
What is your favorite sport?
My favorite is NFL football too.
I plan on going to the Superbowl this year if Tampa Bay makes an appearance.
So you are a Tampa Bay fan?
I have been for the last few years. What about you?
I grew up a Miami Dolphins fan.
I am glad Nick Saban gave up the Dolphins to come back to coaching college football.
If he had stuck around he could have made something of Miami.
The Dolphins haven't been relevant in years
Alright alright enough trash talking.
Now I am fired up for the season. Trash talking is one of the best parts of being a fan.
Do you play fantasy football?
Of course I do!
Want to join my league?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose your favorite ex-footballer?
I liked Ochocinco!
But he wasn't a great player.
He had personality and style!
Now that, he definitely had.
He has lots of personality, if nothing else.
He became a celebrity!
Yes, they let him in Hollywood!
He belonged there.
But he wasn't that crazy while still playing!
Yeah, he flourished.
Whose your favorite?
TO. Terrell Bryant!
Another reality star.
I got to see his personality on his show.
The show was short lived!
Maybe he can play ball again.
I doubt it.
Is he that out of shape?
I'm sure he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the drama in Seattle?
NO what is going on up there?
They are gonna have a running back battle for the ages.
They already had Rawls and he was really good.
They did but he kept breaking that leg.
That was brutal! I am glad Carroll is sticking with him so many would not.
Well  in free agency they got Eddie Lacy and he is really good.
Lacy came from Green Bay right?
Thats the one!  I guess he has shed some pounds and they expect good things from him.
Well that means Seattle will be pounding right down the middle then, huh?
Having two guys they can rotate thru and keep fresh all year is a coachs dream.
Isn't that the truth? That is gonna make Seattle a powerhouse.
Yea when Rawls was heathy and was in beast mode he was so quick.
He was like a firework shoothing thru everyone!
So Seattle is gonna be one to watch out for.
I can not wait to see how everyone does in the preseason.
I think it starts early August so we just have a few weeks to go.
Lets plan a watching party at my house when it gets rolling.
Sounds good to me. I will bring the drinks and you supply the football on TV.
You know it will be on the big screen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, your a Cowboy fan.  Who is your all time favorite Dallas player?
Tony Dorsett.
Good runner.  What do you like most about him.
His greatness.  His amazing running and catching ability.
Alright, who is your favorite Dallas Coach?
Tom Landry of course.
What's your favorite Cowboy moment?
The 95 Superbowl victory over Pittsburg.
Have you ever gone to a Dallas game?
No, but I did go see the Seahawks once.
Oh, who did they play against?
San Frisco and they beat them soundly.
Do you like Dallas's home or road uniforms better?
I don't have a preference on that.
What team do you like the least?
Pittsburg Steelers.  But the Raiders run a close second.
Not any NFC East teams?
Oh, yeah I'm not an Eagle fan.
Who do you think will win the Superbowl this year?
Dallas Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the preseason?
I heard they grabbed him in the first round.
I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno.
I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field.
Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?
Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere.
You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round.
Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them.
Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get.
He did have some impressive plays. None of them got Flacco to the finals.
I think they are rotating rookies until his return.
He wasn't awful, but definitely not worth writing home about.
He started in 2011.
For some reason he remind me of Vick, classic Vick.
Again, that's a team effort. Brady does not stand out of the pack.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
Ben, Brees, Romo, these guys would kill to play alongside Manning not Brady.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?
Now there is a biasis opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the idea of more regular season games?
I would love if they would cut out one or two preseason games for regular season games.
What about risk of injury and health concerns for the players?
Well, on one hand, they are signing up to play a rough sport, so I think they should be aware of that.
Right, but as it stands 16 games in 17 weeks is a rough schedule.
It is. So, lose two preseason games, add an extra bye week, expand the roster.
Do you think NFL would ever consider a rotation for key positions? Like the MLB does with pitchers?
That would be an interesting idea, and would open up spots for more players.
I think fans would be concerned about the quality of play from their team, though.
That is a concern, like if you have a Tom Brady and then a bunch of backups who play.
NFL season isn't as long as an MLB season, though, so maybe they'd only need to rotate and rest their star once or twice.
Yes. And MLB teams still manage to dominate even with pitching rotations, so I think NFL teams could too.
So you'd only add one or two extra games to a season?
Yes. There comes a point when a season is too long and it feels like there are pointless games.
Again, like MLB and their 162 games per team per season.
Exactly. I think no more than 20 games, max, for NFL. Long enough for a decent season, but not enough where games feel pointless.
That's a good point. You don't want players in a rough sport playing games that don't matter much in the end.
Right. And I like the current length of the NFL season. It doesn't overlap other things too much.
Right between NBA and MLB, for the most part. And the season doesn't drag into too much extreme weather.
Yeah, I wouldn't want it starting too much earlier than it does; too hot for players in all that gear in summer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sunday night football is at my house this week.
OK. That works for me.
Do you want to do dinner or snacks?
I will bring pizza.
Sounds good to me.
Good. See you then.
Wear your jersey. I want a picture of us together.
Ok. I will. Just for you.
Thank you sweetie.
Are you ready to see me in my element?
Yes, I love seeing you excited.
NFL football definitely excites me.
I am glad we found something we can do together.
Me too.
Who would have every thought football would be my favorite kind of date night?
I told you that you would love it.
You did. I do love it now that I am understanding it.
You have caught on quick.
I am trying. I still have a lot to learn.
That just means we watch more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am a football fan and a bit of a historian on it.  Do you like football too?
Yeah I liked all the old players and about some of the old games.
Some of the guys were so tough back in the day.  They played both offence and defense for the whole game.
So they were.  One time in a championship game the field was really slippery so they went out at halftime and got sneakers and changed shoes which gave them the edge for the game.
I saw the first Super Bowl and remember that it was really cold and the Packers won the first two Super bowls.
Vince Lombardi was the coach and the trophy won at the Super bowl was named for him.
They had so many tough guys playing, like Jim Brown who rushed for so many yards.  He was amazing.
I love the running backs like O.J. who was such a great player but so sadly fell and became criminal after his career was over.
George Blanda was a great player.  He was a great quarterback and kicker and extended his career by becoming a kicker.
Sure.  He was the highest scorer when he retired and held the record for so many years.
I remember Super Bowl 3 when Joe Namath assured a win when he was the underdog.
And then they beat the favored Colts.  Soon after the NFL and AFL merged.
The player I loved for his play and presence was Joe Montana.  He was the comeback kid.
There was no one like him when his team got behind and needed to score in the waning moments of a game.
He did it about 30 times if I remember right, how awesome is that.
He was a good role model too.  They are hard to find, so many players receive so much for playing and seem so selfish.
I liked that Tim Tebow.  He seemed to play well with Denver but the sent him off to take Peyton Manning  instead.
That was the end of Tebow.  He floated around a bit but never caught on anywhere else, almost like he was a joke or something.
I guess my favorite player was a real rebel.  Jim McMahon of the Bears.
They had good chemistry with coach Mike Ditka.  It was a flash in the pan but a remarkable time in football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the first head coach to go this year?
I mean is it always Marvin Lewis?
I know what you mean but I think he has the best job security
Why do you say that?
He should have been fired years ago.
Yeah besides him though who do you think gets fired first?
Its a tough one because I think the league is trending on patience.
Pederson in Philly?
They definitely give him the year.
When do you think they would fire him?
Midseason next year
Thats a rough time to fire a coach.
Yeah but they need to see what he does when Wentz has weapons
Well what happens if he does well but the defense still plays poorly
Then the defensive coordinator gets fired.
And Pederson is off the hook?
Until they miss the playoffs, yeah
Thats an easy out I believe
Not really you want to stick with a head coach and franchise quarterback
Yeah I guess I never think they are patient enough in the NFL
XXXXXXXXXXX
My brother is a good friend of one of the Denver Broncos
Really? Which player?
It's Mikaila Ulmer, he's really a nice man.
He's one of their best players too, much better than their older seasoned players
I agree.
So what does your brother and he talk about
Mostly football stats
Does he talk about his stats or the team's
Both. And he likes talking about the rookies
Which ones do he think are the team's MVPs?
According to my brother he really likes DeMarcus Walker, and Chad Kelly
Didn't they both just sign contracts
Yes. Four year contracts to be more exact.
How long does Mikaila think he will play for the Broncos?
I don't know if he asked him that
He's really good, I doubt they will let him go
My brother has gotten free tickets to at least two of the games too
No kidding? Did he get good seats?
Front row.
Wow how lucky to be friends with one of the players
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the next NFL season will go?
I mean, I hope it is less drama.
What do you mean?
Well, there was the whole deflate gate thing.
What is that?
A NFL controversy.
What happen?
At the 2015 playoffs, some one supposedly purposely deflated the football.
Who was the guilty party?
New England.
Was Tom Brady involved?
Yes, that is why I mentioned it.
Did he get in trouble?
He had a four game suspension last year.
Wow, I missed that whole thing.
Yes, I think they will have a good year now.
I hope so, he is a good player.
The Patriots always have a good chance at winning.
You think so? I have a feeling the Steelers will make it to the bog bowl.
I think they have a good as chance as any one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are the Bears gonna be this year?
Terrible.
You think?
They're a terrible team and have been for a long time.
You don't have faith in Trubisky?
I don't have faith in the organization.
Why not?
For one, they can't retain talent. Marshall, Forte, Jeffrey, all gone.
Cutler too.
Cutler wasn't great but face it, he's the best QB they've ever had.
Better than McMahon?
Way better. That team got by on its defense.
All Bears teams have.
And this Bears team has a terrible defense as well!
They're pretty sad.
What's even sadder is how they think they're this legendary franchise because they won once.
They're an old team, though.
Yeah, with a long history of futility.
They have the Ditka sketch though.
And that's about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think anyone can beat the Patriots this season?
I'd like to think so, but they always seem to come through.
True. That huge comeback against Atlanta in the Super Bowl was infuriating.
Yea, Tom brady isn't going anywhere any time soon, either.
Nope, and they should have Rob Gronkowski back at tight end, also.
Yep, plys they added Mike Gilleslee from the Bills for backfield help.
Yeah, I am not sure anyone in the AFC can challenge them.
Definitely not in the East. the Dolphins may win 9-10 games, but the Bills should only win 8 and the Jets may win none.
Right. And other than the Steelers, there's no one else who could post a threat in the conference.
Well, maybe the Raiders could. if Derek Carr didn't get hurt before last year's playoffs, they may have beaten New England.
Probably not. But with Marshawn Lynch getting some carries now, they could maybe do something.
It would be hard for Brady to get away from Khalil Mack on the pass rush.
Yep. But no one else has the talent to beat them in the AFC.
And who knows if the Falcons can soar again in the NFC?
Yeah, that felt like a lucky run. Dallas and Green Bay could emerge from that conference.
True. And the Buccaneers are vastly improved. But could the beat the Pats?
I doubt it. As annoying as it is, we may be loking at another New England Super Bowl.
Unfortunately. Kinda takes some of the fun out of the season.
But at least there won't be any more Deflategate stories this season.
True, but I'd just assume never hear about The Hoodie again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready for football?
Heck yeah i am ready.
Did you see where Marshawn Lynch went.
He is with the Seahawks right?
No he got traded!
Wow he did?
Yes he is with the Raiders now.
Oh wow really?
Yes
I think he will do good with their team.
He is a good player.
I agree.
I think the Seahawks were saying because of his age.
That is sad
He is good he will fit in with the team great.
Derek Carr is good too.
He will be healed by the time it starts.
Good they will be a scary team.
They will do some damage.
I agree. Can't wait to watch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Superbowl XIV.
Who played in that one?
Steelers against the Rams.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Terry Bradshaw for Pittsburgh and Vince Ferragamo for Los Angeles.
Where was it played?
The Rose Bowl.
Who was the favorite?
Pittsburgh.
Who scored first?
Pittsburgh on a field goal.
What was the score at the end of the first quarter?
7-3, Rams.
And at the half?
13-10, Rams.
Surprising.  Who did the halftime show?
Up with People, saluting big bands.
Thrilling.  What happened in the end?
Pittsburgh won, 31-19.
Wow, they won a lot of Superbowls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So i see Ryan Griffin is going to be the Second String QB for Tampa
And Sefo Liufau will be third string.
Right on, sounds like a good QB line up.
Bryan Anger is coming back as the Punter.
He's good, who re the other two?
Dunno, i do know we got Deshaun Jackson as a wide reciever tho.
Oh, very cool.
Yes. Chris Goodwin and of course Mike Evans are returning this season.
Mike Evans stood out last season, very good to have this year.
Speaking of Wide Recievers, Josh Huff i hoping to make the cut as well.
How are his stats?
I dunno, he's fresh to the scene
Ah, well, i'll wish him luck.
Same here.
Oh, very cool. He put points on the board last season.
Yes he did.
Isiah Johnson is returning this season as well.
Right on. He was another poins earner from last season.
Yes, i think we got a good crew, hoping they make playoffs this season.
Same here!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who's going to the Super Bowl this year?
Patriots for sure, nobody can stop them in the AFC.  Maybe the Cowbows in NFC?
Cowboys?  Seriously?  Come on, Seahawks in the NFC!
Yeah right.  Their defense is getting old, and Russell Wilson is one sack away from their offense being a bust.
No way.  Yes, the defense is getting older, but come on, they're still one of the top defenses.
Ok, but I still think it's the Cowboys.
Dak Prescott over Russell Wilson? You must be kidding.
Nope, Dak Prescott is the man!
Russell Wilson, any day.  Dude might be shorter, but he has more heart and can do crazy things with the football.
Now if only he could play defense too...
Stop with the defense thing!
But it's true, they are getting old.
Richard Sherman is still a shutdown corner.
But wasn't he almost traded?
But he wasn't, he's still there.
True.  But I bet he doesn't play as well this year, knowing he's probably done with the Seahawks.
And don't forget the rest of the Legion of Boom...Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas?
Aren't they both brittle with injuries?
Whatever dude, we'll see who's laughing at the end of the season.
Yes, we will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXIV.
Who played in that one?
San Francisco against Denver.
Who were the coaches?
Dan Reeves for the Broncos and  George Seifert for the 49ers.
Where was it played?
The Superdome in New Orleans
Who were the broadcasters?
Pat Summerall and John Madden.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Joe Montana for the 49ers and John Elway for the Broncos.
Who scored first?
San Francisco, touchdown pass from Montana to Rice.
Did Denver score?
A field goal.
What was the halftime score?
27-3, 49ers.
What happened in the rest of the game?
A 55-10 blowout by the 49ers.
I believe that was four SB losses for the Broncos.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the NFL should have more games?
I'm not sure why they would want that.
Well, there is always more money in 18 regular season games
That is true, but would the players  like Tom Brady allow it?
I am sure they could change the rules to make them happy.
How would that be possible?
Well, maybe the rosters could be expanded.
Is there enough talent to go around?
I think so.    After all most teams carry three quarterbacks now.
Really?     Give me an example.
Well, the Cowboys have Dak Prescott, Appleby and Rush.
OK, I guess that makes sense.
I think they could also change the rules to help out the players.
How would that work?
Well, maybe a rule that each player must be given a week off during the season.
How would that help things?
It would keep the amount of contact level, and a week of rest during the season.
Would the coaches go for that?
I think they might.     It would help everybody out to some extent.
Yes, I guess I agree, particularly if they reduce the preseason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Dak Prescott can get Dallas to a championship this year?
I hope so. It has been a long time since we have been there.
He looked really good last year.
True. I think he was just too inexperienced to get as far as we wanted him too.
I think so too, and the fans leaned too hard into wanting Romo back.
I don't think Romo is as good of a quarterback as Prescott is.
He was when he was younger, but he gets injured too frequently now.
He really has had some serious injuries. He probably should have stopped playing a few years ago.
If their defense can do better this year I think they have a real shot with Prescott in as lead now.
Yeah the defense has been pretty bad the last few years.
They also need some more action from their receivers. I think Beasley should get more play time.
They don't use him much because he isn't a big guy.
He does really well when he is in though.
Except for the fact that he tends to turn over the ball during key moments.
That hasn't happened often though and he has definitely scored more points than he has lost.
He is an important part of the team. I don't think the give him the credit he deserves a lot of the time.
He has had some key plays that have won games but they always focus on the star wide receivers.
They definitely can't afford to lose him.
That's true and they might want to give him a better contract so they don't lose him to another team.
It would be a shame if they lost him to another team because they don't appreciate his talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember early in Russell Wilson's career when he used to go down field and lead block for Marshawn Lynch?
He still tries to run down field and block for his guys. I love the attitude, but it's not exactly something I want to see my franchise QB doing.
Hasselbeck used to do it too. I kind of like the tradition. His most notable was the Beastquake run, but that wasn't nearly the only time he did it.
What's the beast quake run? Never heard of it.
It's not a story Sean Payton would tell you.
unless it's in a big game like the sb. Cam newton didn't go for that ball when someone who wants to win like Wilson or Brady would have dived for it regardless.
Hundred percent, but I'd argue diving on a loose ball is significantly different from blocking much bigger defenders downfield when your block (as the quarterback) really isn't most likely gonna do much. Same sentiment tho so I get your point, I'll never understand cams reaction in the super bowl
Tell that to Drew Brees
I don't exactly know what you're reffering to but I can pretty much guarantee Easy Breesy would dive on a loose ball in the big game
Just saying I think they both take balls. Blocking and diving on a ball. Hats off to any QB that does either. Brees is the man
I wouldn't say Cam is scared to block or take a hit
The broncos rocked him all day. Great day.
He was demoralized. I recall him not having a real challenge that entire year until that game. Every game before that was all smiles and dabs.
That's what made their loss so great and I guess being division rivals
What are some great years for Football fans you can remember?
The 2003 Cowboys have a special place in my heart being I missed the championship years.
Who's the common predicted division winner that you don't see winning their division?
Packers. The NFC north is weird right now. Rodgers will probably carry them tbh, but who knows.
It will be similar to last year in which 9-10 wins will win the division.
The Packers are going to be a lot better, we had injuries early which destroyed us. I see us as a 12-13 win team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It seems like many of the executives for the NFL are former players.
That makes sense, though.
How so?
Who can better understand the game than someone who has played it?
True, but they often don't have business experience.
They seem to learn on the job.
Can you think of some success stories?
Sure, consider the career of John Elway.
What did he do?
As a player, he won two Super Bowls as an all-star quarterback.
And, what did he do as an executive?
As a general manager, he put together a team that won Super Bowl 50.
Both of these feats were done with the Broncos?
Yes, that's correct.
Can you think of someone with similar accomplishments?
Definitely! Jim Thorpe was an amazing football player and one of the founders of the NFL.
Yes, and George Halas took a similar path.
You're correct. In fact, George Halas played and coached at the same time!
Wow!
And, it wasn't just that he played and coached. He was also the owner and ticket seller!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Russell Wilson has recovered from those nagging injuries he had last season?
I hope so and so do the Seattle Seahawks. They'll need him to be 100% again this season if they hope to compete.
They made it through the regular season last year and just got destroyed by Atlanta in the playoffs.
I wouldn't say they got destroyed but they definitely looked a lot inferior.
That's true Atlanta was on fire to end the season and that offense was nearly unstoppable.
Not to mention it but Atlanta's defense stepped up in the playoffs, so you couple that up with their offense and Seattle had no chance.
I think a healthy Russell Wilson would have made a difference.
I don't think it would've mattered. The Seahawks last season had so many holes to fill on their team.
Does it seem weird to you that Marshawn Lynch is going to be in another NFL Jersey playing for another team next year?
It doesn't really surprise me that much, people forget that Marshawn was on the Buffalo Bills before coming to the Seahawks.
Right, but with the Seahawks, that's when Marshawn became the BEAST and was really a public face people recognized.
I think winning a Superbowl does that. It puts you into the spotlight.
Oh no doubt about that. I think it'll be strange seeing him in a Raiders jersey next year.
I'm excited about that! The Raiders are on a climb and I think they'll really challenge the Patriots this year and might even make it to the Superbowl.
That could happen if Derek Carr is back and fully healthy. If not I don't like their chances.
They're one of the favorites this off season and Carr is young, he's going to recover.
I hope he does, they looked great last year with him!
I think it'll be even better this year with Marshawn to take pressure off of him.
The Seahawks should be able to take the NFC West this year I think. Arizona looks weaker.
We'll have to see. Things change so much each year in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, are you still a really big NFL fan?
Yes, it is pretty much the only sport that I follow very closely these days.
I thought so. Me and a friend was having a debate at work the other day and I thought about you.
What was the debate about exactly?
We were debating who the best NFL team of all time was.
That is debate that I am sure has taken place millions of times in offices all over the country.
I love talking about the NFL whenever there is down time at work.
So who did you say the best team ever was?
I strongly believe that the 2007 New England Patriot were the best team ever.
Are you serious about that?
Yes I am serious! They got all the way to 18-0 and had Tom Brady and Randy Moss together.
That is true, however, they did not win the Superbowl!
I understand that; but you can not let that undermine what a wonderful season that they had.
They did have a great year, but you can not put them in front of any other team that won the Superbowl in my opinion!
I guess we will have to agree to disagree on this one!
So who did your friend have as the best team ever?
He said it was the 1972 Miami Dolphins.
I am not sure if I agree with that one either, but he is way closer than you are!
Hey! Who would you say is the best team ever?
I think I would have to go with the 1985 Chicago Bears.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you catch the game between the Buccaneers and the Falcons?
Yes, it was a good game.
Who was the winner of the game?
Tampa Bay won the game 31 to 24.
How many yards did Winston throw for?
Winston threw for 281 total yards.
How many passing yards did Matt Ryan have?
Matt Ryan had 334 passing yards.
Who led Tampa Bay in rushing yards?
Tampa Bay was led by Doug Martin who had 62 rushing yards.
Who led the Atlanta Falcons in rushing yards?
The Falcons were led by Tevin Coleman with only 22 rushing yards.
Who was the top receiver for the Buccaneers?
The top receiver for the Buccaneers was Mike Evans with 99 receiving yards.
What about Atlanta? Who was their top receiver?
Atlanta's top receiver was Tevin Coleman. He led the team with 95 yards.
Were there any fumbles for this game?
No, there were not any fumbles at all.
Okay, thanks. I appreciate you giving me those updates.
No problem. Anytime, you need to know something, just let me know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how well do you think the Redskins will do this year?
Hopefully alot better than last season.
Yeah last season was a heartbreaking disappointment.
True, they really should have made the playoffs.
Well, if everyone stays healthy they may have a chance.
True, especially if Kirk Cousin's has a solid year.
Not only that but seeing that they lost Desean Jackson the other wise receivers need to step up.
Yeah, Jackson was so good it is hard to replace him.
The defense needs a overhaul.
Yes, the defense wasn't bad but needs some help.
Oh and the kicker was sub par as well.
I mean he tried his best but missed a few key opportunities.
This may be a semi rebuilding year for the Skins.
I have faith in them turning things around.
What do you think there record will be this coming season?
Well I would say maybe 8-8.
Hmm that seems a little low!
Well, ok then maybe 10-6.
I guess only time will tell.
Very true and i'm very excited to see what happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think a woman will ever play for the NFL?
No, no way, never.
Why not?
Biology.
Not sexism?
No, basic biology.
Ok, Doctor. Tell me why not.
The only position women have been able to do somewhat well in in high school and Division 3 college is the extra-point kicker.
So? Put them there!
I worry the defensive tackles won't want to tackle them out of fear of hurting them.
So then they get a free extra point.
Yeah, but here's the other thing. The male kickers can kick it farther.
Not more consistently, though. Gender and aim don't go together.
True. But a 60-yard field goal? No way.
That's probably true.
I'm not saying don't use them for short extra points or field goals, but I don't see them competing anytime soon.
This still reeks of sexism. Give them a chance.
A woman wouldn't succeed in the NBA but that's not sexist. Baseball is possible, but not the NFL for sure.
I hope one day you're proven wrong.
Me too. It'd be fun to see but deep down seeing a female get tackled full-force by a 350 pound lineman hurts to think of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you heard any word on who might be starting this year for the Dallas cowboys??
Well i heard Tony Romo was quitting and gonna try his hand at coaching.
yeah he is getting old and way to injured to just keep dragging the Cowboys down
Daq Sheppard looked real solid last year.
pretty sure he surprised everyone last year wth those stats.
Yep sometimes the unknowns are who can bring back a team
This year is the dallas cowboys year
Lol dont you say that every year pre season???
The seattle Seahawks coach if moved to the cowboys would be a super asset.
yeah the cowboys really need to gain ground with a first run coach.
Dont matter who the team players are if the coach cant keep a team united then the team will fall apart.
I was sad to see the ex head coach of the oregon ducks being fired from lack of game wins last year
Evweryone has stats to keep coaches are really no diffrent.
the owner of the teams dont want any kind of looser. Team members change as frequently as a season coaches are known to become the teams family.
Honestly i dont care who goes to the super bowl this year long as its not the patriots.
ha still hating on the team or what??
well tom brady has been csaught red handed cheating. we all know that without the cheating the patriots would never made it to the superbowl that year
yep they lol stole the dallas cowboys chance to go to the superbowl
that is one case that cheaters never prosper
true to point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if the Patriots will be able to hold their title this coming season.
I doubt it, they've got big egos now.
I really wish the Packers could make it to the SuperBowl again.
Yeah it's been a while, but I think they still hold a record number of titles.
That's cool.  What commentators do you listen do for game-day coverage?
I don't, I usually watch the games on mute while I get some homework done.
So did you actually watch when the Patriots beat the Falcons?
Yeah, went to a local sports bar to watch the game.
You like Tom Brady?
Yeah, he's a great player, but he doesn't seem too bright.
I don't think being smart is a requirement for playing in the NHL.
True, some of the other Hall of Famers aren't working with a full deck.
I don't think Tom Brady is in the Hall of Fame.
No, not yet.  But I bet he will be.
True, he'll probably be the most notable Patriot in the NHL Hall of Fame.
There was Troy Brown back in 2007.
I'll tell you though, I'm really not a fan of the Patriot's uniform colors.
How come?
I just expect more stars and stripes for a team that calls themselves Patriots.
Haha, I think that would be distracting on the field.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the top wide receiver in the league?
We can argue all day about that one.
Okay, who do you think are the top tier receivers?
Antonio Brown from the Steelers is top I think.
Don't you think Julio Jones from Atlanta is better?
Julio still has a little bit to work on in his game.
It seems like the guy breaks open every game.
What about Odell Beckham from the NY Giants?
I see him in the top ten but he does not have great top end speed.
Like DeSean Jackson?
He is a great over the top receiver but not overall plus is getting older.
Plus he has the big ego and occasional dumb play and doesn't do the possession receiving well.
I like the bigger body receivers who seem to do better overall.
Like Dez Bryant from Dallas?
He has the kind of build I think a prototype receiver should have.
Or like Alshon Jeffrrey?
We will see what kind of year he has after coming off of an injury year.
He was a big threat in the games I've seen him in, though.
And Jordy Nelson paired with Aaron Rogers is great.
Nelson makes Rogers all the more dangerous when he is on the field.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a football fan?
Yes, I grew up watching the Cowboys.  This got interesting when I was in Nashville.
So did you become a Titans fan?
I've never rooted for an AFC team in my life!  But my boys on the other hand...
You mean the didn't cut their teeth on Romo and Co?
I wish!  They'd watch the Titans game at noon, then go mow the lawn when the Cowboys kicked off at 4:00.
Disgusting!  How did you lure them back?
Football snacks.  I thought about forcing them to watch the Dallas games, but...
A plate of taquitos goes a long way.  It had to help that the Cowboys had a consistently good team.
Sure, but the media was all about the Tennessee Titans.  It was hard for Jerry Jones to compete.
I'd imagine, but they enjoy the game just the same.  You follow the NFL draft, keep up with who's on waivers?
I mostly just enjoy the season.  I used to know those things when Dallas was at Valley Ranch in the old days.
And now that you're in Michigan.  I bet everyone is a huge Detroit Lions fan.
We prefer Eli Manning--since Payton's retired.  Never cared for Archie professionally, though.
The ol' Cowboy-Saints rivalry, eh?  I know how it is.
Don't make me laugh, but yeah.  Archie Manning is a stand-up guy; love his sons.
And football, though it's become politicized these past few years with that Colin Kaepernick kneeling stuff.
Yeah, but maybe we should change the subject.
We could talk about the Red Skins and Supreme Court cases...
Washington?  Don't get me started!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How excited are you for the Patriots this season?
Oh man, I am so stoked.
I am too! What's your prediction for their record?
I think they could go anywhere from 10-6 to 16-0. How about you?
I think they're going 16-0!
I think they have a chance! Back to back Super Bowls?
That would be so awesome. They've added so many players.
I know. I'm most excited about Brandin Cooks. How about you?
Cooks is gonna be nasty in this offense. I'm excited about a healthy Gronk.
Yeah. Bennett was good in his absence last year but Gronk is the best.
I'm also stoked about our new running backs.
Yeah. I think Gillislee is going to be great. I don't know much about Burkhead though.
I think Burkhead will be just fine. They can't keep all those backs though, who do you think gets cut?
I think DJ Foster is gonna be the odd man out.
Yeah I do too. I'm also excited about the secondary. Two number one cornerbacks?
Gilmore and Butler are going to dominate.
Where's the Super Bowl this year?
I think it's in Minnesota.
I've always wanted to go to Minneapolis. If the Patriots get in, wanna go?
I'd love to. We'll see though. Hopefully they make it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Super Bowl XIX?
No not really.
It was one of the greatest QB matchups of all time
Really? Who was playing?
The SF 49ers and the Miami Dolphins.
Oh wait, Joe Montana and Dan Marino?
You got it.
Wow, I had no idea they played against each other in a super bowl.
Yeah, it was quite the shoot out as well.
Was Marino a rookie that year?
No, it was his second year.
Oh wow, who ended up winning?
The 49ers by quite a bit.
Did Marino go on to any other Super Bowls
No, that was his only one.
Oh man, what a disappointment.
Yeah, could never get a strong supporting cast to support him.
That's too bad.
He's still one of the greats though.
Yes he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bro! Ready for the season?
Yeah I am!  The Eagles are looking good this year.
Yeah they are, we made some good pick ups this year.
Yes sir, I'm excited to see how Alshon Jeffrey does.
Me too man, between him, Jordan Matthews, and Green-Beckham, I think we're looking solid.
Can't argue with that, our Running backs are looking pretty good too.
You're not lying, Darren Sproles is a little beast for his age.
What do you mean for his age?  He's a top 10 running back in the whole league.
Alright, I guess you're right.
You know what was most surprising to me?
What?
That we picked up Foles again.
Really?  I didn't see that, when did that happen?
In March man! How'd you miss that?
I have no idea.
Get with the program man, he's probably going to move in front of Daniels.
That's not saying much, I don't think we'll need anyone besides Wentz.
He's definitely the best QB we've had in years.
Yep, every since good old Donovan Mcnabb.
The greatest Eagles QB of our time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your most memorable Steeler game
2008 AFC Championship against the Ratbirds.
Why? It wasn't the Super Bowl!
My brother-in-law and sister are fans that crappy team
Wasn't that played in Baltimore?
Yup. Nosebleed seats surrounded by Rats.
So what happened to your family?
Well, they left when the Ratbirds got the ball with us leading 16-14. Superstition ruled their motives.
Scarey McScareys, huh?
Yup...lol.
Everytime they went to the bathroom during the game something good happened for us, so...
So when Pittsbugh intercepted the ball, where were they?
They were on the ferry going home.
Wow...unbelievable
Me, I was waving my towel wildly amongst all those Rats.
That had to be dangerous...
Nah. They were too depressed to do anything to me
True, had to be. I would have been to scared to do that
You only live once man,,,lol
Goodness gracious man, you're dangerous
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the redskins
Yes
They are a good team
They do have some good players
When does their regular season come out?
September 10
Im ready
Me too
Who do they play
Falcons
Oh alright
Should be a good game
Yes it should
When do they play cowboys
October 29
I really want to see that game
Good teams
Yes it should be a great game
I wish they played them earlier
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Looking at the upcoming schedule for the NFL, what games interesting games stand out?
Patriots and Raiders in Mexico City.
Good one. Those two teams in Mexico City with the high elevation and pollution thick enough to chew. Interesting to say the least.
The Cowboys have a string of games heading into Christmas that are insane.
Which games?
They go to Giants stadium for a rivalry, they play in Oakland, then they have the Seahawks coming into Cowboys stadium.
Oh wow. That is a rough patch. Giants have had their number and should be even better, then a rejuvenated Raiders in Oakland, then licking their wounds back home against a team like Seattle. Man.
That sandwich game in the middle with the Raiders is interesting. Cowboys will be coming in after their rivalry and Raiders will be off of a rivalry in Arrowhead vs. Kansas City.
Who does Oakland play after the Cowboys?
They go to Philly. Never know which Eagles team will show up year to year. I know they don't like Christmas though lol.
So the Raiders have to face their rival, the Cowboys, and then go into Philly on Christmas Eve where they boo Santa Claus and throw snowballs at him?
Yep. Should be a real interesting stretch late in the season with teams that are already fighting hard heading into the playoffs.
That is some insane scheduling.
Yeah the AFC West and NFC East playing each other this year makes it extra brutal for those teams in particular.
Patriots @ Broncos. Patriots struggle in Denver in the thin air. This is the week before they go to Mexico City in the Raider game.
So they'll have the back to back road games vs. tough teams in high elevation environments. The scheduling seems extra harsh this year.
A lot of good games though.
Great games, actually, but rapid fire. I shouldn't be this excited about football this early.
I know. I've barely flipped through the schedule myself and this just seems like a really intense season.
Can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Peyton Manning?
I loved him! He was such a great player.
He was such a good person off and on the field.
Yeah, I love his commercials.
He trained very hard, did you know that. Every summer, he would go with his brother to train at the Duke University.
oh wow, really? that sounds amazing.
Well, he couldn't just be good out of no where.
I supposed. But then tell me, why isn't Eli so good?
I think he's good. He won a superbowl after all.
Well, he got really good receivers.
No, I think he just need a couple more years and he will be in top shape.
If you say so.
Do you even like football?
Of course I do, I watched them since I was a kid.
Oh really? What's your favorite team?
Umm I like the Browns.
Haha, you like the Browns and you are making fun of Eli Manning.
Well yeah, he play for one of the worst team in the League.
You think the Giants are bad!?
Oh I though they were playing for the Jets...
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think is the NFL team of the future?
Well either the Cowboys or the Texans.
Yeah, with Dak the Cowboys seem to have a good future.
The Texans have a good coaching system, and with Watson who knows how things will look a couple years from now.
Lets not forget they have a lights out defense.
Oh man yeah they do.
Would be nice if they could get set at Quarterback too.
Yeah, hold on to that defense for a few years and they will be a real threat.
Cowboys are already there.
Yeah, some people say Dak is the new Brady.
A lot like him, overlooked then lights out.
Lets just see if he can keep it up.
I think he can.  He looked pretty good out there this year.
Yeah he did.
What about Tampa Bay?
Yes!  Winston is pretty good and next year might be a sleeper.
Titans too.  Not too long ago these teams were trash.
Yeah, and then drafted franchise QB's.  But Tampa has made the bigger turn around.
Yeah, I think Winston is the better one.
I think one or both of those guys might make the playoffs next year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get your BUCS tickets yet?
Yes, I renewed the tickets.
Me too. I loved our seats last year.
Plus, the team is actually better.
I agree. I think they did well in the draft.
I hope Jameis can keep getting better
Well they focused on D this year so that should help
Well it cant be any worse
Good point.
Ugh, that was painful to watch
No kidding
I thought this was going to be better, not worse
Maybe it will take a few years?
I am not sure but they better get it resolved
At least we have good weapons
True, there isn't much excuse now
Also, we are in a weak division
Hopefully we just don't play down to the competition
I know
That said, I am excited
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I am a big Carolina Panthers fan!
How long have you liked them?
Since they came to Charlotte over 10 years ago.
They went to the super bowl a few years ago didn't they?
Hell yeah they did?  They should have won it.
Their quarterback Cam Newton is really good.
He's a little eccentric but he's a hell of a football player.
Are you guys going to be good this year?
I think we have a chance to have a pretty good team. We made some moves in the off-season and got better.
I heard you guys picked Julius peppers up.
Yes, he played for us years ago and now we've got him back.
Any other team  that you pull for?
I pulled for the Seattle Seahawks because of Russell Wilson.
Are you a big fan of his?
Sorta, my bill for him because he went to my almamater, NSCU.
That's pretty cool. Any other team do you like?
I'll pull for the Colts as well because my wife is from Indianapolis.
Have you ever been to an NFL game?
I've been to a couple Carolina Panthers game. It is a lot of fun to go to a live game
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the superbowl this year.
I hate to say it but the Patriots.
Those cheaters?
Yep. Tom Brady is still pretty good
And they have Gronkoski still too.
And that evil cheating coach Bill Bellichick
Tom Brady is 39 years old though
That might slow them down
I think the Falcons also have a chance though
I don't like Matt Ryan
Me either, but he's a great QB
Who else is good for the Falcons?
They have a new tight end
The rookie?
Yeah Eric Saubert. He's going to be good.
I hate to say it but I think Dallas might do well this year too
I love watching Dallas lose
Who is their QB?
Dakota Prescott so far
And a bunch of back ups
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about the NFL.
Okay.
What team is your favorite?
I like the Buffalo Bills.
Oh nice.
Yeah my favorite player is Charles Clay.
Oh cool.
Yeah what is yours?
My favorite player is Jeremy Butler.
Oh nice!
Yeah I loved that touchdown the other day.
Same!
I kept cheering over and over.
They truly are the best.
You don't hear too much about them nationally however.
Yeah it is rather unfortunate.
Well anyways nice talking to you.
Same!
Until next time!
We will speak again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that tackle
I did, I can't stop rewatching it
I can't believe how hard he hit that guy
I thought he was dead
he probably did to. I'm surprised he got up
I have never seen someone get hit that hard
Like a truck
his helmet flew halfway across the field
he probably has a concussion.
yeah, I hope he is okay, but what a hit
he didn't drop the ball though
I don't know how he held on to it
don't drop the baby
i guess not
that is going to be a top play for sure
yeah, be ready to see that clip again and again
I don't mind, I can watch it all day
this guy is crazy, he is going to go a long way
I need to draft him for my team
yeah, not if I do first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When do you think Tom Brady will retire?
I mean at this point, probably 50.
You think he can hold up that long?
No not at all.
So why would he do that?
He could probably back up for the last part of his career.
So we still have about 10 more years of Brady?
I wouldnt be shocked if we did.
He has still been competitive.
But how many Super Bowls can you win?
For him he might want to have the most ever
Doesnt he already?
I think there have been a couple of players that have won 6 or 7
But no quarterback
No these were players who were role players on their team
But he already has his legacy cemented
He wants to make sure he cant ever have his records broken
Do you think he wants to overtake Peyton's records?
Yeah that plays a role too
So his drive is really to leave no doubt he was the best ever.

Hi there, I am gettin really excited at for the upcoming season!
Me too! Go RAMS.
Oh, man. I like the Rams but I am a Packer fan!
Okay, nice. Rogers is one of the best Quarterbacks of all time so I watch the Packers too.
Yeah, I was not always a Packer fan but I have been since 1991.
Who did you like before that?
I was an Oakland fan. But it was because I was raised that way.
Okay, got it! My dad raised me a Steelers fan and I switched when I was in highschool too.
yep, exactly!
I just love football season in general, man.
Agreed! I want to see the Patriots line up this year and see if we can see any change up in the solid program they have.
Yeah, I have not heard about much. I also wanna see where Tony Romo goes this year.
Oh, I heard he might be going to the Broncos actually.
What! Oh wow that would be crazy.
I used to love the Broncos when they had Manning.
oh, yeah the good old days!
I know it, the rules have changed so much and the regulations are such that it feels like a different game sometimes.
Right, the game we grew up on has evolved so much.
The best part is that the players are safer now days.
I agree with that! I like knowing less concussion on the field!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you watch NFL football?
Of course! What's your favorite time?
Mine is the Detroit Lions!
Seriously? Why, they're not very good.
Sure, but I like going to Ford Field, it's one of the best in the NFL.
I'm not sure about that.  Part of the fun is watching a winning team.
That's true, but the Lions have been doing better lately.
That's funny. I heard someone say that the Lions may be the only Michigan team to go to the playoffs this coming year.
Well, I've been watching the Lions since they played in the Plontiac Silverdome.
The Pontiac Silverdome? Is that even still around?
Sadly, no.
What happened to it?
Once the Lions left Auburn Hills for Detroit, the Silverdome became a ghost town.
Well, that's fine, Ford Field is a lot better, anyways.
I like the new home of the Lions.  Ford Field is near a lot of other stuff.
Well, hopefully, the Lions will make it even better by winning.
You're absolutely right!
Go Lions!
Go Honolulu Blue!
I hope they win something this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Raiders seem like the team to beat.
I was surprised when they added Lynch.
Carr could be the best QB in the league very soon.
Yeah, he's already the highest paid.
I think it's a bad idea for them to move to Las Vegas.
Agreed, they've got a lot of momentum and now this is a distraction.
Do you think they can get past the Patriots?
Yes, Brady is getting old and they are due for an off season.
Not sure if the Raiders defense will be good enough.
Mack is a great young player, but their secondary had issues last year.
They're a
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are footballs really made out of the skin of pigs?
No,
Then why are they called pigskins?
There was a time when pigs bladders were used in footballs.
You're joking, right?
No I'm serious.
That's really gross.
I think so, too. But, then they were replaced with a type of rubber.
So no animals skins are in footballs?
Cow leather is used as the skins of the footballs.
I wonder how many cows are used to make footballs.
I read where it takes 600 cows a year to supply the skins for the footballs.
So then one lucky cow might actually have its skin make it to the Superbowl?
It could happen.
I wonder what the odds are.
The odds are 1 in 17,420,000.
Have you been reading up on football trivia again?
I confess that I have.
Well, you've come up with some interesting stuff.
Thank you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Oakland Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
I think it sucks, and that type of move is a huge reason why I'm largely turned off to the sport.
Why do you say that?
I think the NFL really thumbs its nose at its fan base when it uproots a team from a devoted community like that.
But the San Francisco 49ers are also in the Bay Area, no?
Yes, but fans typically pick a favorite - Cubs vs. White Sox, Yankees vs. Mets, and 49ers vs. Raiders.
But don't you think Las Vegas is a big enough market to support a team?
I don't think so, because Las Vegas' population at any given time is made up largely of tourists.
Well, wouldn't tourists come out to watch a football game?
Not really, because they are not loyal followers of the home team.
Have you heard whether the Raiders will substantially change their uniform following the move?
I haven't heard, but I would expect so.
I wonder what stadium they will play in.
My guess it will be a new stadium built with taxpayer dollars.
Wow, that sounds like a total racket.
It certainly does.
It is almost as if any city willing to tax their residents to pay for a stadium can poach an NFL team.
Yes it does, and just goes to demonstrate that the NFL is really a corporate business, not fun and sport.
This isn't the first time the Raiders has moved is it?
I don't think so, but I don't recall all of the history off the top of my head.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Dolphins are going to do this year?
Not too sure they are in a tough division.
They made the playoffs last year.
They caught some breaks and depended so much on their running back.
What was his name again?
Jay Ajayi, he helped them out a lot.
Have your seen there schedule this year?
Ya it is going to be a lot tougher.
Tannehill might mature and do better under the new offense.
Here's to hoping.
When you are in the same division as the Patriots you can't expect to much.
Ya they are beast to contend with.
Adam Gase's offense might finally be able to bring down the Patriots.
The Patriot defense isn't what you need to worry about it's their offense.
The Dolphins are going to have an uphill battle for those two games.
Tell me about it.  I got tickets to one of the Patriot games.
How did you swing that?
Bought them from a guy at work selling them.
Have a great time, Hopefully the Dolphins pull out a win.
That's what I'm hoping for.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that NFL show on Amazon?
No I haven't, what's it called?
It's called All of Nothing. I really recommend it.
Sounds good. What's it about?
Well, they go behind the scenes of a team, and follow them for a season.
Really? And show everything?
Yes - the arguments, the celebrations and the heartache too. It's a real insight.
What team do they follow?
Arizona Cardinals. Even if you don't support them you should watch it.
I definitely will. I'm a big fan of the head coach Bruce Arians.
He comes across really well in the show. I didn't know much about him before, but respect him a lot now.
What do you mean?
He works his players hard but always with their best interests in mind.
That's true, and he's got a reputation for helping the ones who are in difficulty too.
That's something you see a lot of. I'm not going to give any spoilers though!
Fair enough. Is it something the whole family can watch?
I don't think so. There's a bit of swearing in it.
That's a real shame, but I guess it's part of what makes it authentic.
Absolutely right, they don't put anything on for the cameras, it's all real and as it happens.
I can't believe I've never heard of it before! I'm going to download the first episode right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL team do you like to root for, despite not needing to?
Not needing to?
You know, like not rooting for a regional team, or someone you grew up a fan of, or someone you know.
Oh, like rooting for the Giants like you do, despite being from Chicago.
Right.
You're silly. And, probably the Packers.
Why them?
They have an insanely-long waiting list for season tickets, meaning every game is a sellout.
Right, that's true.
But the best part is the city.
How so?
Green Bay is tiny, especially compared to other football cities.
Isn't it the smallest?
Yup, by far.
Right, I forgot.
So they have the best fans, I think, due to population and attendance.
Does it matter that they've been winning recently?
Nope, I always admired their fan base.
Big fan of Aaron Rogers?
You know it. Great guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am ready to watch me some NFL football!
Me too. I love watching my favorite teams.
They had a rule change.
Really what was it.
When they celebrate from scoring they have to be easy on the flags.
Good I am glad that rule changed.
I am too. I would be excited to score a point.
I think everyone would.
Agreed. Roger Goodell announced it would be less harsh.
That is good.
I hope a few other rules change too.
I do too.
So many rules change every year.
It is hard to keep up sometimes.
Yeah I would be watching and think something is wrong but it wasn't because of a rule.
I agree. Sometimes it gets so confusing.
They need to be firm in all teams though.
I agree. Refs should not take sides.
Sometimes you can tell who the refs are for.
I agree. I hate when they are one sided.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Aaron Rodgers?
He is talented and entertaining to watch.
His Superbowl win in 2011 was incredible.
That was a great year for the Packers.
How many more years do you think he will play?
That is hard to answer.
Try and make your best guess.
Ideally he must want at least 5 more seasons.
If he gets seven or more that would be impressive.
He will need good protection from his linemen when he gets older.
It all comes down to that.
Right because it is easier to get injured once you are older.
I am sure the linemen will realize that and try their best.
They won't want him to get hurt.
Beyond injury it all depends on if Rodgers continues to perform well.
He improved a lot from 2015 to 2016.
How did his stats improve in 2016?
He had nine more touchdowns then 2015 and only one more interception.
I am sure the nine extra touchdowns made the one extra interception worth it for him.
It definitely did make it not as bad!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XIX.
Who played in that one?
Miami against San Francisco.
Where was it played?
Stanford Stadium, California.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Dan Marino for the Dolphins against Joe Montana for the 49ers.
Who won?
San Francisco, 38-16.
What was the score at halftime?
28-16, 49ers.
Who was in the halftime show?
Tops in Blue, an Air Force group.
Who were the broadcasters?
Frank Gifford and Don Meredith.
Right, ABC's first SB broadcast.
Joe Theismann was there as well.
Who won the MVP?
Joe Montana.
Sounds like not too thrilling a game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Aaron Rodgers?
I love Aaron Rodgers. He's one of the best quarterbacks in the league.
Do you think he's better than Drew Brees?
Yes, a lot better. Aaron Rodgers can do just about anything. I wish we had him.
He's only been to one Super Bowl.
He doesn't get there or NOT get there on his own. They've had so many injuries these past couple of years.
Everyone has injuries.
Last year they had so many people out, they were using their 3rd and 4th string players in some positions.
I didn't know that.
Well, he's infinitely better than Brett Favre ever was.
I wasn't a Favre fan. I'm not a Green Bay fan either.
There are teams I like and others I don't for various reasons. I like Green Bay.
I like the Saints.
I used to like the Saints until that whole deal with the bounties. Turned me off knowing Brees and the coaches went along with it.
They said they didn't know.
They knew. Even the players who admitted it said Brees and everyone else knew. Heck, the coach instituted the bounty and on film.
I forgot about that.
Yeah, it was sickening. They had a bounty on Peyton Manning but didn't get him hurt. They got to everyone else.
That sounds illegal.
I think it should be punishable by law. At least Coach Williams got fired and suspended and Head Coach Payton got a one-year suspension.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!  Season ticket holder!
Season tickets!?
Yea, I went to so many games last year that it just made sense
How many did you go to exactly?
All of them!
ALL OF THEM!?!?
Yea I'm a diehard fan!
I guess you are!
Let's go Buffalo!
...
What?
What a waste of season tickets!
Not a fan I take it?
Of the Bills?  Nope!
Well to each his own then!
I guess you could say that...
...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you a Chicago Bears fan?
Yes, my family is from Chicago
What do you think of their moves this offseason?
I'm a little bit puzzled by them signing a QB and then trading up to draft Trubisky with the third pick.
I agree, it almost seems like their GM didn't plan things out very well
Yeah, but I'm glad they got rid of Jay Cutler.
For sure, Cutler has been a burden on the team for years now
I agree, I liked him at first but the more he played and the more I saw him throw intercepts and then pout on the sidelines the more I knew he wasn't the guy
As Greenbay Packer fan I felt the exact opposite when I saw him throw a pick.
How do you think the Packers will be this year?
I'm expecting a season similar to last year.
Do you think they improved over the offseason?
Possibly, I think their running game will be better but their defense will be about the same.
So that means their defense will be bad right?
Well I know Bear's fans have seen lots of examples of bad defense the last few seasons, but I don't think it will too bad.
Hey! The Bear's defense wasn't that bad last year
Only bad enough to net the Bears a top five draft pick.
You can't blame that all on the defense.
But you can't say that the defense was very good either.
That's a fair statement.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Bears are going to be bad this year.
Yeah, they have no quarterback.
I like the running backs that were drafted.
Yeah, I can't wait to see them play this year.
I think the Giants have a good chance at winning the superbowl this year.
It looks like they have the best team out there.
The patriots are getting pretty old but still could have a chance.
They are coached pretty well so they do have a chance.
The raiders put a lot of money into their quarterback.
Yeah, I'm not sure if that was the right decision.  They should have got a better running back.
The bears defense looks strong.
I think that is the only thing that will keep them in the games this years.
I don't know if the the dophins should stay with Tanehill.
I don't think so either, he is not that good of a quarterback.
Rogers will be strong for the packers this year.
He will come out throwing for sure.
The Steelers have a pretty good squad if everyone can stay healthy.
They look like they have a few all pro players.
I dont think the bears are going to win more than 5 games this year.
If they do its because their defense won it for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how do you think the Bills will do this year?
Probably suck as usual.
Hey don't be so pessimistic, have some hope!
I lost hope years ago.
How could you??
Well they haven't made the playoffs in what, 17 years?
Yeah something like that...
Yeah...it's pathetic
Well their luck has to turn around some time, don't you think?
Probably, but I've learned not to get my hopes up.
Well the games are still a good excuse to get wasted!
True!
So you see no chance of the Bills even making the playoffs??
Maybe, i don't know..like I said I don't get my hopes up.
Well i shall remain hopeful!
Good for you.
So who do you think will be good this year?
I don't know, The Lions?
Because you like cats?
Yep!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you say the NFL has gotten more or less fun to watch in the last ten years?
In my opinion it's a lot more fun to watch.
What do you think that's attributable to?
I think the game is just constantly evolving.
I agree. That has a lot to do with it.
I also think that players are constantly setting the bar higher for eachother.
I agree there, too. It seems like players are way better than they were ten years ago.
Also, coaches and their staff have a better understanding of the game than ever.
Definitely. I feel like NFL football is a lot faster paced than it used to be.
I totally agree. In my opinion it makes it more entertaining.
Some of the passes that they land seem completely unreal at this point.
Yeah, throwing into 3 man coverage and landing it perfectly.
Landing it perfectly from 60 yards back, too.
That's definitely not something you would have seen some years ago.
I think the plays and formations are becoming more unique too.
That's true. In some cases, teams are running completely different styles of play.
The Patriots have very interesting and unique offensive formations.
Yeah, the Colts do also.
Do you think the changes in game rules have made a difference at all?
Not much of one. The rule changes have been very minor as far as I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The preseason starts soon!
Yeah!  I can't wait!
Who looks good to you this year?
Patriots always look good.
Unfortunately you are correct.
"Unfortunately?"  Why do you say, "Unfortunately?"
I'm a Jets fan.
That is unfortunate!
Ha ha funny boy.  Who do you want this season to go all the way?
I think the Seahawks are going to make a come-back!
I can't stand the Seahawks!
Why?
It's the whole "12th Man" controversy.
What is that?
They stole the slogan from Texas A&M.  It dates back to when A&M was one player short, and one of the fans came out of the stands to take a spot on the field with the team.
That's awesome!
Yeah, and everyone that has every been a Texas A&M student or Alumni member knows about this story. It is a tradition that dates back long before the Seahawks were even a team!
That's so cool!
And the Seahawks have stole this slogan and tried to make it their own! I can't respect a team that would do that
This from a man who says that his own personal theme song is the 007 theme song?  I think you need to get over it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your opinion on the Broncos?
They are a good team, I like them.
Yeah, but do you think that they have been slipping since Peyton left?
Well yeah, Siemmeins might not have been on his caliber but just give him a year or two.
That's true, it can be little hard for a rookie to be good on the spot.
That's correct, just look at Jameis Winston, he's doing good, but he can be better.
Haha, but the Dallas Cowboy got the best of both work, no?
Oh yeah, their Quarterback and Running Back are doing great.
Yeah Ezekiel and Prescott carried that team.
They sure did.
Yeah but I think that the Broncos can become every good in a few years.
Yeah no question about that.
They have a good defense, just need to make some play on the run and the throw.
You are talking my mind man.
It's not like they have never made it into the playoffs.
Haha, that reminds me of the Chief.
Why?
They always make it into the Playoff but the can't never win a title.
Really? That's very surprising.
Yeah and they were in the first Super Bowl!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm marking off the days on the calendar to the most exciting day of the year.
What day might that be?
The 2017 NFL season!
I though you said before that Superbowl Sunday was the most exciting day of the year. Changed your mind?
OK .... second most exciting day of the year, second only to the Superbowl.
I'll make a note of that.
Hey, didn't you tell me before that you worked on a Superbowl when you first graduated from college and got a job at an ABC affiliate?
Yes, that was me.
I so envy you! I wish it was me who got to be on the field during the game.
That wasn't the best part for me.
What was?
A college friend of mine who lives in Florida is a team doctor to a football team. They gave him two 10th row tickets but he didn't want to come to Minnesota sothey sent them to me.
Why did you need tickets for, you worked the game?
I didn't use them ... I scalped them.
Did you stand on the street yelling "tickets for sale?"
No. This was pre-internet so I looked in the want ad and found an ad from a professional scalper. I called and they told me what hotel they were in.
You, a college girl went alone to a scapler's hotel room?
NO! My dad took me. He was only 5 ft 6 in so he wouldn't have been much help had anything gone wrong.
So what happened?
I knocked on the door, they opened it with the chain still latched, asked me to show them the tickets, I showed them, he closed the door and came back and slipped an envelope stuffed with $100 bills. I made $1,500 in 1991 money. Fun times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team in the AFC can beat the Patriots this season?
In a playoff game, I don't see it happening.
On paper, that's probably the right answer.
If I had to pick a team, I'd go with the Raiders.
They do have a lot of nice pieces.
I'm a little concerned about the running game, though.
They have an elite offensive line, between Donald Penn, Kelechi Osemele, Rodney Hudson, and Gabe Jackson.
True, those guys can help open up holes for Marshawn Lynch.
The key will be to make sure Derek Carr is healthy for the playoffs.
Not going to the backup quaterback seems like a requirement for all teams.
That's fair.
Oakland's defense is improving too.
It helps to have arguably the best defensive player in the game, Khalid Mack.
He should theoretically improve too, since he's still so young.
Yeah, but I'm still concerned about the rest of the pass rush.
Oakland had the fewest sacks in the league last year, so I get the concern.
Hopefully one of their young players will step up, most likely Mario Edwards.
The passing game should continue to grow, as well.
I like the additions of Cordarrelle Patterson - who will also help in the return game - and espeically Jared Cook.
I'm interested to see how the team does in 2017!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a football fan?
I am. I follow pro, but not college. I can't keep up with college...there are too many teams.
I'm the same way. Who is your team?
I really like the Broncos.
Ow! They are our number one rival!
Who is your team?
Arizona Cardinals. I've been a fan since they moved from St. Louis.
yeah, we kinda have love hate relationship...but I thought your rival was Seahawks?
Yeah...maybe. I can't stand the Seahawks!
Russell Wilson is good though. Isn't he?
I think he is over-rated, honestly. Same as Arron Rogers.
Well, they do win a lot of games though...
You know who's good? The new QB for the Vikings!
Oh, yeah...I can't think of his name...he's good!
They had a good season though.
I know, I would love to see them beat the packers!
Ha ha! Cheeseheads hates that.
My husband is from St. Paul, so we root for Minnesota against Packers.
It will be an interesting season, I think.
Yeah, I'm keeping eyes on the Raiders, too...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about NFL teams moving cities?
I think it is kind of strange.
Me too.
I can't imagine leaving a local fan base.
I wonder if they lose some fans by moving.
I'm sure they do.
There have been a few moves recently.
I remember the LA Rams.  Who else?
Well the Raiders have been approved to move.
They have?
Yup, they will be playing out of Vegas.
Vegas?  Really?
NFL approved it.
That is pretty cool.
Yeah.  I think they will gain a good following.
It would be fun to go to a game in Vegas.
Yes, it would.
You could watch the game and then gamble afterword.
It is a party town too.
Very true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, did you hear what Brady's wife said a few weeks back?
About the concussions?
Yeah. She said like he comes home with them or something like that.
Yeah, there was a story on NFL.com about it i think.
It seems that no one asked him directly about it.
And it seemed like either Billachek or the Patriots tried to cover it up.
I think they were moe like trying to sweep it under the rug like it never happened.
Well, he looks fine.
True and he seems coherent.
I guess it's really up to Brady to deal with this problem.
I thought there was a commission that looked into concussions.
I think there is.
Wonder what they think about this.
It's tricky. the NFL is a multi-billion dollar industry.
True but if you have no players.....
There will always be players.
Yes, but not good ones if you got to get new ones year after year.
Again, it really is Brady's problem. He knows when he is hit or not.
I agree, but he may just want to push thru the pain.
I dunno. It's a unique world in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi there.
Do you like football?
Yeah sure do.
NFL or college?
Both really, but probably the NFL a bit more.
Oh really, why is that?
The professionals are better and the games are more exciting.
I see what you mean.
What about you, watch a lot of nfl?
I watch a few games here and there.
Do you have a team you support?
I like the Ravens.
Oh okay, you from that area.
That is where I grew up, but I don't live there any more.
I see.
Do you have a team that you go for?
I like the Jets a lot.
Man the jets are bad.
Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe there is only 2 months left before the NFL Season?
I know I am super excited, are you going to opening day?
No I cant its on a Thursday September 7th I have school next day. Are you?
Yes my family goes to Gillette stadium every year for opening night, its a tradition.
I think the Patriots are loading up this year as rumor is Brady is retiring.
Oh no way I don't believe it, I know the papers mentioned it but he said he wants to play 5 more years.
Yeah but did you hear his wife Giselle mention that last year he played with concussions?
Yeah that was crazy. What do you think about the Jets horror show this year?
Oh man I cant believe what they are doing, that should be illegal!
I know right ! How can you cut every single high priced player just to lose every game to get the #1 pick.
Its crazy, I know some sports the teams try to tank during the season to get a better draft pick, but not BEFORE the season starts!
Hey are the Patriots even playing Jets in New York this year or only in Foxoboro?
Yeah they play them in New York on Sunday October 15th.
Oh no way! Is that a flex game or is the time set?
It looks like its set for 1pm. Do you want to drive down here to see them?
Oh man YES, you can get me 2 tickets over there? I would love to bring my girl.
Yeah I can get tickets to Met Life stadium here of coarse, nobody is buying them this year since team is tanking.
Thats true but I think the Patriots game will be fun.
OH YES! The entire stadium will be filled with Patriots blue, pretty funny to see that in New Jersey.
Awesome man I will see you there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how many teams are in the nfl?
No, how many?
32
It seems like more than that
It really does
Who do you like?
I like the colts
They are pretty good
Who do you like
Vikings
My mom loves that team
She has good taste
Thats what she says
I could never get with that team
Im suprised you dont like the same team as her
Thats what everyone says
I can imagine
I wanted to have my own path
I understand that
Thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you thrilled about the upcoming NFL season or what?
I'm getting there!
Who are you rooting for these days?
Being that I live in North Carolina now, it's hard not to root for the Panthers.
I understand.  I've loved the Broncos for as long as I can remember!
I know.  My friends call me a turncoat but I can't help it.
You used to be a Dallas fan, correct?
Yes, but that was a long time ago!
I gotcha.  I wonder how the Broncos will do this year.
I bet that will do well.  I can tell you that Panthers fans here are rabid!
Really?  How bad is it?
It's everywhere!  Tee shirts, caps, bumperstickers...
That seems to be everywhere though!
It's even worse here, I promise.
So will you be going to any games?
I might.  It really depends on my finances.
That makes sense.  When was it that the Panthers went to the Superbowl?
It was in 2003 but I didn't live here then.
They must really hate the Patriots there.
You got that right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best QB in football?
It has to be Brady right?
I mean I don't think anyone is wrong for saying that, but man its hard not to take Aaron Rodgers.
But Brady has 5 rings?
Well, if it wasn't for a terrible defensive collapses, Rodgers could easily have 3 or 4 himself.
Come on, you could say the same thing about Brady!
I mean I guess, but back to the topic - Rodgers or Brady for just this season.
While if you're asking it that way, probably Rodgers then.
Yup. Totally. He's clearly on another level.
I guess. I really hope the Packers can put together a respectable defense with him.
Well, how about this - wouldn't you love to see a Brady and Rodgers Super Bowl before Brady retires.
Oh my god yes. It would be legendary. It would probably be the best QB matchup in Super Bowl History.
Hmmm. What would even some comparable matchups be?
Well, Kurt Warner-Roethlisberger was good. Brady-Eli happened a few times.
Favre-Elway back in 97 was pretty darn good.
Oh yeah. That one will be tough to top.
What about Trent Dilfer and Kerry Collins back in 2001?
Bahhahhaa. Good one!
Yeah that is probably the worst ever.
Yeah that was probably one of the first super bowls I vividly remember.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Titans will be this year?
Much improved is my guess.
Why in particular?
For one thing, they are developing a very good offensive line.
They definitely have been collecting some good young talent.
It helps that they've got Murray running behind them.
Yeah, he's reminding me of his glory days.
You mean when he was with Dallas?
Right.  His time in Philly was no glory day for sure.
Yeah, what a mess that was.
What do you think of Mariota?
He's improving year after year.  Seems like a good pick so far.
Man, that guy has some jets.
Yeah, he ran all the time at Oregon.
It really helps when he scrambles.  Linebackers can't catch him.
He picked up tons of first downs last year from running out of the pocket.
I think the key with him is keeping him healthy though.
Yeah, you can't run for your life and not expect to be hurt.
I think they can challenge the Steelers to win the division.
I hope so.  I hate the Steelers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't decide who's the best linebacker in the NFL right now.
The position has some real depth to it.
I could probably name three guys who stand out at the top of my head.
Alright, well who would you put up top?
Probably the sack master himself, Von Miller.
I'd probably slot him at #1 too.  Reigning DPOY.
He's just so quick.  An OT alone can't seem to stop him.
He certainly drives the Denver defense and makes their CB's look better.
After Miller, it's a toss-up.  I can't decide.
Probably Mack, though right?
See, I can't decide between him or Kuechly.
Both are good choices for sure.
I would probably say Mack though.
On what grounds?
Well, Mack is faster, younger, a bit less banged up.
That is a good point.  Kuechly was out much of the year.
I would probably give Luke the edge in covering the TE.
Sure, that's his bread and butter.
But for rushing the QB, Mack looks to be the real deal.
He might challenge Miller for DPOY I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey who is your favorite team?
The Carolina Panthers
Cool, I'm a Colts a fan
Nice, how do you think they'll do this year?
Ok, I'm not too thrilled about our defense
I see, I think we have the potential to go all the way
Do you think Cam will have a better year?
Yes, I think with his injury and concussion out of the way he will be back to MVP form
I feel the same way about Andrew Luck
Do you have any predictions for the superbowl?
I think the Patriots will probably win again
Yeah, they always seem to get better every year
Tom Brady is the ageless wonder
I agree, he might go down as the greatest ever if he's already not.
Do you think any teams in the NFC have a shot at beating the Pats?
Well Obviously I think the Panthers have a shot
Anyone other than the Panthers?
Maybe the Falcons if they can recover from that choke job in the super bowl
I think Seattle can do it
Hmm Im not sure I think their time has passed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I can't figure out about the NFL?
What?
Why are the Dallas Cowboys America's team.
Maybe back in the day, you know, with Roger Staubach and Walt Garrison and Tom Landry.
And Preston Pierson and even Tony Dorsett. Remember Ed Too Tall Jones?
Man, who could forget him? They had everything. Remember that flex defense that Landry invented?
You know, he invented the 4-3 too, way back at Baltimore.
So I agree they were good. No doubt. But now?
They got this Prescott guy from Mississippi State. He was awesome for a rookie.
He wad awesome for a pro.
You got that right. And then that running back.
Ezekiel Elliott from Ohio State. He reminds me of Emmitt Smith.
He's built just like him, isn't he? Runs low to the ground.
Like a bowling ball. Hard to stop, hard to bring down.
So I guess they'll be good again this year.
I'll be honest, I thought they were going to the Super Bowl last year.
Me too. Didn't they have the best record in the league?
I think so. In the conference anyway.All without Tony Romo.
I thought their season was over when he got hurt.
Maybe that's why they're America's team. Overcoming adversity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking we should have a superbowl party this year.
That sounds like fun! What teams are playing again?
This year it's the Patriots and the Falcons.
Hmm. I'm not a huge fan of either team, but I bet a lot of people here like the Falcons.
I'd be really surprised if they didn't.
Okay, then how should we decorate? Should we make it clear that it's a pro-Falcons party?
I don't think so. Let's just make some interesting snacks.
What did you have in mind.
When I watch football games, I always want pimento cheese.
That makes sense, for this part of the country.
Yeah. So I think we should definitely make that.
Okay. Do you have any other ideas for things we could do that's themed?
What do you mean?
Like, do you have any ideas for food that plays homage to one of the teams?
Oh, I see. Let me think.
I did have one idea.
What was it?
It's silly, but I was thinking we could carve a watermelon into the shape of a helmet, and then put fruit inside it.
That's too healthy to watch an NFL game!
I think we should do it anyway!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Only sixty three days.
Sixty three days? Sixty three days till what?
Sixty three days until football season!
Seriously, I mean don't you follow baseball?
I cannot wait. The Steelers are going to bring home the Championship this year for sure.
You think so huh? Aren't you forgetting something?
What do you mean?
I mean are you forgetting that New England is also going to be playing this year.
Yeah, that is an issue, but I think this is the year that we win.
How do you beat Tom Brady?
It is all about the defense's ability to get to him. He can be shaken and beaten. If you can get to him a couple of times he tends to lose his temper and then you can beat him.
Who is going to do that?
Well, Cam Heyward was injured last year and he will be back. Bud Dupree was also hurt for a while and he should be back.
You think those two guys are enough?
They will definitely help but the secondary is also going to have a lot more experience working as a team.
How does an experienced secondary help you get to Tom Brady?
If they have got their men covered then Brady can't release the ball and our front four has more time to apply the rush.
I see, so it is all about teamwork.
That's right, unless of course you are the New England Patriots.  Then it is all about Brady.
You got that right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am a huge Atlanta Falcons fan.  Do you follow the Falcons?
In the past I have not, but last year they grabbed my attention.
Yeah.  They had a great year.
I can't believe they blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl. Very frustrating.
I know.  Of course, my Atlanta Falcons help Tom Brady continue to build his legacy.
It's so frustrating.  As if Tom Brady doesn't get enough love as it is.
Yeah. Tom Brady will be known as the best ever for sure now.
Hey, at least Matt Ryan had is first MVP season. He was fun to watch last year.
The Matt Ryan to Julio Jones connection was on fire last year.
Unfortunately, the Falcons lost their offensive coordinator after the season.
Kyle Shanahan will definitely be hard to replace.  He did a very good job.
Yes he did.  Who did the Falcons hire to replace Shanahan?
They hired Steve Sarkisan.  He used to be the head coach at USC and he was the offensive coordinator there before that.
Oh ok.  Who do you think the biggest competition for the Falcons will be in the NFC this year?
I don't know.  I know the Cowboys and Seahawks should be good again.  I wouldn't be surprised if the Panthers rebounded from last years poor season.
Yeah.  I was thinking the same thing.  I think the Panthers are a real threat in the NFC South.
What about the AFC?  Who are the contenders?
Of course, the Patriots will be right there.  I'm curious to see if the Oakland Raiders can have another good season.
Really. That should be interesting.  I hope to see Derek Carr have another good season and stay healthy.
Right.  He will need to stay healthy to earn that big, new contract.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey which teams do you think will go to the Super Bowl this year?
That is a tough one, but I think the Patriots and Cowboys will make it.
The Cowboys? Really?  They always lose in the playoffs.
True, but I think this year will be different.
Why do you think so?  History says otherwise!
Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott make for a tough matchup for any defense.
They are great players, but they are too young.  I don't think they have developed the necessary leadership skills yet.
I disagree.  You saw what Dak did in his rookie year alone.  He is a natural leader at the quarterback position.
He did well, but I think it was a fluke.  Rookie luck.
I guess this year will be the true test then!
I think you are right about the Patriots, though.  They never seem to lose!
Definitely.  Tom Brady is a beast.
Do you think Brady is the best of all time?
You certainly could argue that.  He has won so many championships.
For sure.  He has a competitive drive like no other.
It will be hard for any quarterback to replicate what he has done.
Unless it's Dak Prescott!  Haha.
Yeah yeah, he has a while to go before he gets to Brady's level.
You are right, but they are both good quarterbacks at this point in time.
Exactly.  Ok, I have to go.  Take care!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited about the upcoming NFL season, when does it start.
Preseason games will begin in August.
Who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Baltimore Ravens.
They are known for something in particular, what is it?
The Baltimore Ravens are most known for their in your face tough defense.
Thats right and who was their star defensive back.
Ray Lewis is the best known linebacker and probably one of the best to ever play in the NFL.
What all did he do at the Ravens?
He was one of the original players when the Ravens first started.
How long did he play for?
Lewis played for 17 years and his entire career was spent with the Ravens.
WOW, did he win any super bowls.
Yes, Ray lewis helped the Baltimore Ravens win two super bowls.
How much did the defense actually play in winning a super bowl.
In 2001, the defense held their opponent to 7 points winning the super bowl easily.
Was Ray Lewis a big part of the defense in that game.
Yes, Ray lewis won the superbowl MVP that game for his performance.
I can't wait for the new season to kick off.
I can't either and I hope to see lots of good defensive games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi! are you  a fan of football?
yes  my team is Dallas cowboy what about you what is favorite team?

ah none

okay then see you on thursday
yeah see you and thank's
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey pal, only 2 months till the NFL returns
I know I'm really excited.
What are you most excited for?
I liked the draft, I'm looking forward to seeing the new players.
Me too. My team got a steal.
Oh yeah,  who's your team?
I root for the chiefs.   I'm excited about the addition of patrick mahomes.
Yeah it will be interesting to see if he challenges Alex Smith at all.
I don't think he'll be more than a solid backup this first year.
You never know,  look at dak Prescott last year.
Yeah true,  he really helped the cowboys a lot.
I was surprised that kc let go of John Dorsey... I wonder what caused that.
I don't know either it's not like they haven't had success recently.
Yeah.   Who is your team?
Green bay.   I became a fan after they drafted jordy Nelson.  Loved him at kstate.
He really was a surprise,  glad to see him back after his knee injury 2 years ago.
Yep, he's an asset for sure.
I guess it isn't too surprising since he was coached by Bill Snyder.
Yeah the wizard can turn a good player into a great one.  Just like Tyler lockett and his success with Seattle.
Yeah he's fantastic,  love watching his returns.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best running back ever?
Gayle Sayers.
Why?
His peers reported that he was the most difficult to tackle.
Yes, but he did that through agility.
Is there another way?
Yes, you can do it through strength.
Give me an example.
Beast Mode.
Who is Beast Mode?
Marshawn Lynch!
What makes him so great?
He's impossible to bring down.
Why?
He just refuses to go down. He drags people with him.
Wow, that sounds amazing!
He's scary. And, the great thing is that he's back.
What do you mean?
He just came out of retirement to play for the Raiders.
Sounds like a good match. I can't wait to see him this fall!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man I miss Kelly's work in the NFL
Kelly? Who's kelly?
Chip Kelly, he was the coach for the Ducks at UO and went on to become the head coach for the Eagles
I remember him, he had a good run for a while, but sort of fell off the radar
He was best known for the up-tempo offense where he didn't worry about the clock, but instead of wearing out the opposing team.
I liked that, it made the games kind of like a constant 2 minute drill with the no huddle.
Yeah, for a while there it looked like he might have had a really dynamic team with eagles with a rush/pass offense
I don't know how long that was going to work, it seemed kind of gimmicky
It was a return to basics and, for a while at least, he had Sproles and Murray on the team, if they'd had a rushing QB who knows
I could see that, but with the inside/oustide threat there any rush QB would have not been that big a threat.
Well, during the offseason at least, they had Tebow as a back-up QB and he wasn't accurate, but so much of the tempo is about pace and not making mistakes
That's what doomed them a lot was Sanchez wasn't really a threat there and he did through a lot of INTs
I know, I like the guy, but he wasn't a rush threat and a great CB made the whole affair irrelevant
Yeah, because you just stop the rush and trust the CB to do the rest.
That's why they did really rock as team though, the Eagles I mean.
Why, the defense? I remember they were pretty physical.
That and an incredible special teams unit. If Kelly had filled in the pieces he needed, i imagine they would have been SB contender
I don't know, maybe but against Seattle or Arizona they would have been beaten with 3 and outs and then just ground to paste by those offenses
I'm not saying they were unbeatable, but if the pass threat had been there you would have only heard Kelly's praises sung.
Hopefully he gets another chance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Some professional football players have had some really strange names.
Like Ben Gay?
Yes, the former running back for the Cleveland Browns.
I think one of the weirdest was Fair Hooker.
Seriously, someone named their kid that?
They did. He drafted by the Cleveland Browns.
Have you heard of Captain Munnerlyn?
No I haven't.
He played for the Panthers and Vikings.
I wonder why he was named Captain.
He was given the name by his grandmother who named him after her great grandfather.
OK. That's actually kind of sweet.
Here's another one for you. C .J. Ah You.
How did someone even come up with a last name like that.
Well, he's of Samoan heritage.
Maybe that's a normal name in that culture?
Maybe. Here's one more. Lawyer Milloy.
Think his parents had a career goal in mind for him when they named him?
Could be.
A lot of football players really have weird names.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the nfl draft this year?
Yes, I actually did watch all three days.
Really? Who is your team?
I am a browns fan.
Oh, okay. Well, I like the steelers.
Oh no...
Yeah...but I was happy wih our draft.
Yeah, I wa okay with ours for the firt few rounds.
I tought it was good at first, but after researching, your picks could all be big or bust type players.
Yeah, that is a bit worrisome to me.
Yeah.
You guys made some pretty good picks though.
Yeah, I liked the first pick.
Yeah, jj watts brother.
Hopefully he is close to being as good as his brother.
Yeah, his brother is very good.
I wish they would have went higher on the cornerbacks.
Yeah, I understand, but they did pick two of them.
Yeah, hopefully they will work out.
Yeah, ou do need to get another corner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh just sixety more days till pre-season football starts
Oh, i can't wait. You still rootin for the Bucs?
Well, Bucs, Miami and Jacksonville.
You know first game will be the Bucs Vs Miami.
I do. My father and i will be glued to that first game.
Really? Why is that?
He is a Dolphins fan. Has been for years.
Wow, i didn't know that.
Yeah, he was into them back in the Marino days.
That was like the ninties, right?
Somewhere around that time.
How long have you been a Buc fan?
Since i moved down from North Carolina, back in '99.
You were a Panthers fan prior to that?
Yes, even tho they sucked. Soon as i moved they got good.
Figures, that's always the case it seems.
Only three pre-season games this year.
Who are they playing?
Well, the Dolphins, then the Bears and then the Vikings.
Then the season starts. I so cannot wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what are you thinking for your fantasy football draft strategy this year?
I would say the top three picks are D. Johnson, L.Bell, or E.Elliott.
I agree with you, I would pick David Johnson first.
David Johnson will get 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving this year.
You throw in 20 touchdowns he is the clear number on e pick.
After the three running backs, I'm thinking Antoinio Brown, Julio, and OBJ will be picked.
I think I would pick OBJ over Julio this year.
Reallly?
Yeah, Julio isn't consistent at scoring touchdowns, he rarely gets over 10 in a year.
Yeah but the yards and catches are awesome.
I think OBJ gets almost as many yards and will outscore Julio by 8 touchdowns.
Yeah, but Eli manning is throwing to him.
The addition of Brandon Marshall will take coverage away from him and open up the field.
True, Brandon Marshall is a huge upgrade over Victor Cruz.
Where do you rank Melvin Gordon?
I rank him at 7.
I agree with you on that. He's a full time running back on a decent offense.
I really like Gordon, he catches and is their goal line back, he's primed for a huge year..
I also like L.McCoy.
I agree McCoy should have a great year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any new rule changes for the NFL in 2017?
A fair few, yeah. For starters, regular season overtime is now only 10 minutes.
Really? Any reason for that one.
They cite player safety and the fact that only 26% or so of games the last few seasons had overtimes that went longer than that.
I guess that makes sense. But I do wonder if we'll see more tie games now.
I would imagine so, even if they are still relatively rare.
A bit cheeky to cite player safety as a reason for a rule change but not consider dropping Thursday Night Football.
I agree, but I bet those Thursday night games get them more money.
No doubt. Any other rule changes?
Yes, the best one! They are loosening up on penalties for on field celebrations!
Whoa. Does that mean touchdown dances are back?!
I hope so! There's still some restrictions - can't delay the game, mimic use of a weapon or be "too sexy" - but it's a good sign!
That is awesome. Maybe they will be able to lose the No Fun League moniker!
Group celebrations, using the ball as a prop and going to the ground to celebrate are the things that won't be penalized any more, specifically.
I am so glad. The touchdown dances were always a fun thing to watch.
Players got very creative with them. Think of how sad a place the world would be without the Ickey Shuffle.
I had completely forgotten about the Ickey Shuffle. I am not sure if I am thankful for the reminder or not, haha!
What would you consider the greatest touchdown celebration, if not the Ickey Shuffle?
Easy! The Lambeau Leap, of course.
Lambeau Leap isn't a dance, though, it's just a jump into the fans. Ickey Shuffle forever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's up?
It's not your team's win lose record, that's for sure.
Dude, why are you always hating on Manning?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
EJ is playing with some real vets.
I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out?
I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
My guy at least won a Super Bowl in the past five years.
Have you caught any of the St Louis games.
It doesn't matter. Manning's 4-0 is still not worth bragging about.
They started 3-1. At least they were competitive.
If he starts enough games, he can be top tier after this contract.
No, Brady's team has done multiple Super Bowls. What are Brady's acomplishments as a player?
Geno may get less now, but he's on a better team.
Dalton and Rogers got overlooked in the draft.
I didn't even know their contracts were up.
That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie.
Free agents usually don't go for the bidding wars, but I guess they are staying put for now.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You a Giants fan?
Nah, I'm not a big fan at all.
I really liked them during the Bill Parcels era.
Yeah, that was a pretty good era.
Yeah, he was there during the 90s.
How many Super Bowls did they win back then?
The won one in 1986 and another in 1990.
Oh I remember the 1990 one. That was against the Bills.
Yep, one of the four that the Bills lost.
Yeah, that was the infamous Scott Norwood kick.
Yeah, who can forget that.
And the start of the Bills Super Bowl losing streak.
Man, must hurt even more being Scott Norwood.
How many Super Bowls have the Giants won in total.
Four in total. One in 2007 and one in 2011.
And they both were against the Patriots in the 2000s.
Yes, I believe you are correct.
Man, they know how to play against the Pats.
Yeah, Tom Brady's worst nightmare
Definitely. The New York Giants!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about the Saints signing Peterson?
I am skeptical about Adrian Peterson myself. How about you?
I agree with you because everyone is doubtful.
I was also wondering how much longer that Tom Brady will play.
Yes a lot of doubt s surrounding that subject too actually.
Yes, I don't know how old Brady is now? Do you?
I think he about 41 years old now.
Oh okay, that is old for a quarterback.
How old was Kurt Warner?
I believe he was about the same age as Brady, actaully.
The Packers have Aaron Rogers and he is awesome! How old is he now a days?
Rogers is 33 years old this year and at his peak, I believe.
Rogers did not get very good blocking last year and I hope they beef up the line up this season.
Yeah seriously!
Have you heard any new linebackers being recruited?
I don't really keep up with the Packers as much as I should.
I understand that time flies during off season.
Right, I like the Red Zone because I get the highlights and stay informed.
Yes, The Red Zone is always on at my house!
My tv is set to record that every single week!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you hear the Raiders are moving to Vegas?
They're doing what?
Yeah, moving to Vegas.  No more Oakland Raiders
Wow, I hadn't heard.  You know this isn't their first move.
Really. I always assumed they were from Oakland.
No, I think they have moved a few times but always end up back in Oakland.
Well, I wonder what the Raider fans think about that.
They are pretty loyal in Oakland.
I know, you don't get fans like them anywhere else.
They are crazy.  Wearing all that stuff like skull head on their shoulders and all that.
Yeah, pretty insane.  I think that they are the wildest fans in the NFL.
The dog pound gets pretty crazy too.
True but not like it used to before the old Browns left Cleveland.
Of course there is the Dirty Towel too in Pittsburg.  They have some pretty good fans too.
They sure do.  Stemming from the 70's when they won four titles in like 5 years.
Yeah, the old Bradshaw days.
Those were good but being a Dallas Cowboy fan those kinda still hurt as two of those was against the boys.
Yeah, classic confrontation.
Too True.  I waited 19 years but they finally got them back in 95'
Took you a long time to get revenge on the Steelers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which past non-divisional rivalry do you wish could be reignited?
Packers-Cowboys used to be vicious
Honestly, now that Elliot and Prescott are showing signs of being something special, I'm feeling it again. Still nowhere near the Seahawks rivalry, but it could get there.
49ers and Cowboys is another one
I kinda miss having a rivalry with the Colts, it looked like Luck was going the same way of Manning when we played in the playoffs two years in a row, but the last two seasons the Colts regressed pretty hard.
I've said before it wasn't a colts-pats rivalry, it was a Manning-Brady rivalry, and it just transferred to the Broncos. For some reason people tried to say I was just salty about it.. when at that point the Patriots had won the last 3 games by a combined 90 points or something ridiculous like that.
The Patriots and Colts were rivals long before Brady and Manning. You do know they used to be in the same division, right? That rivalry goes back to like the 60's.
That doesn't mean they were rivals. People pointed out how "funny" it was that their rivalry didn't start until the colts left the division constantly back before 2011 when Peyton left.  Are the bills rivals with the titans because they were in the same AFL division?
The Pats-Colts rivalry was born when Willie McGinest stopped Edgerrin James at the 1. The Pats-Colts rivalry died when Griff Whalen snapped the ball to Colt Anderson.
From a non-bias standpoint, what's the best overall season in NFL history?
2011-12 was a season for the ages. There were lots of great playoff games and couple blowouts. Saints vs 49ers, Steelers vs Broncos, Giants - Packers, Giants - 49ers, Ravens - Patriots, Giants Patriots  Even the blowouts were fun, Brady had like 5 TD passes before halftime vs the Broncos.
Brees also set the single season pass yardage record that year, which Peyton obviously broke (by one yard actually) in 2013.
And only missed out on MVP by Rodgers having one of the best QB seasons of all time, throwing 45 touchdowns and 6 interceptions with 122.5 passer rating.
And Eli was the only super bowl winning qb to throw for 4900 yards in the season when he won the Super Bowl.
I'm just waiting for Jameis Winston to win MVP this next season so every fucking NFCS QB has an MVP but the actual best QB in the division's history.
I'm with this guy this year has a very special place in my heart for some reasons. But jesus, if Tebowmania wasn't fantastic.
Tebowmania is one of my favorite moments in NFL history
I get it. He's not a good passer and everyone is amazed by the attention he got during that time. But he was winning games in crazy ways. Of course it's not sustainable to win with a guy who passes like that, but he does have a particular set of skills that helped him win games in exciting ways.
Having the best defense in the league and an easy schedule helped him win games.
Uh, we definitely didn't have the best defense in the league that year. A lot of things contributed to Tebowmania: luck, Matt Prater, clutch defense, etc., but you can't overlook the fact that we were coming off a 4-12 season and were 1-4 when he took over, and we ended up winning the division and a playoff game with Tebow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is a better quarterback, Manning or Brady?
I'm from Indiana so Peyton Manning.
You think he is better than Tom Brady?
I think Brady is a great quarterback but Peyton is my man.
Why do you think Peyton is better?
Peyton is more of a football robot than Tom.
If your team was down 6 with the final possession.  Who do you want leading your drive to win?
I hate to say it but Tom Brady.
Really, why Tom over Peyton.
Peyton is great but he isn't clutch.
I think that's why Brady is better than Manning.
I will give you that.
Do you think Peyton needed more help in Indianapolis?
The Colts defense was always ranked high, but we weren't that good.
You had Dwight Freeney who was a beast.
He's about all we ever had on the defense.
You also had Bob Sanders.
Who was always hurt.
If I was going to learn football from a player, I'd want Peyton Manning to teach me.
Peyton is a football robot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best receiver in the NFL?
I think it is Julio Jones.
Does he play for Atlanta?
Yup, he is a Falcon.
That is what I thought.
He has great hand eye coordination.
He can really catch can't he.
He also is very graceful and has good balance.
I have heard some receivers take ballet lessons.
I have heard the same thing.
They almost need to for the jumping and landing they do.
I'm sure it helps.
Jones is great because he has Matt Ryan throwing to him also.
Yeah, Matt has turned into a decent quarterback.
They could be good this year.
I think they will be competitive.
I think they could win the whole thing.
Early in the year for a prediction like that.
I know, but I don't think it is too far fetched.
A lot can happen during a season, especially injuries.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen the packers' schedule for this season?
not yet. why, what's up?
they have a tough schedule this season.
why you say that?
they play seattle, the falcons, bengals, and dallas all within the first five weeks of the season.
didn't all four of those teams make the playoffs last season?
i think so. i'm not sure about the bengals.
well it looks like the packers might have their hands full this year.
i know. i just love aaron rogers though. he's a beast.
i know right. i just can't wait for the season to start.
well the pack play the eagles in preseason on august tenth.
that's right around the corner.
i think that the uh training camps start in two weeks.
yeah they do.
i might try to get tickets this season for when the packers play the saints.
when is that?
they play on a sunday night on october twenty-second.
if you get tickets i want to go too.
yeah, late october, it shouldn't be that cold.
yeah right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best defensive player is in the NFL?
I can't really pick one.
I think it is JJ Watt.
He is a tough player.
Yes he is.
I played OL in High School and can't imagine trying to block someone like him.
It would be nearly impossible.
He is strong and fast.
Yes he is.
I think I have thought of another player I think is best.
Who is that?
Von Miller.
Good choice.
Linebacker is a tough position.
It is for sure.
You have to be able to really read the offense.
Yup, have to have your eyes up at all times.
Von does that really well.
He does.  He also finds the gaps and hits hard.
Good tackler as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey is it football season yet?
Man I know it, I am so ready!
I think the draft went really well for Dallas this year, don't you?
Yea they got that defensive end from Michigan in the 1st round, right?
Yea they got Charlton in the first round and Awuzie in the second.
I can not wait to see how they perform in California in training!
I am ready to see who lands in Quarterback this season.
I think that is a no brainer after what happened last year.
Do you think they will make it to the superbowl this year?
I think they have a good shot!
If they can win out the East I think they should also.
I know I am tired of the Patriots always winning.
I hear that. I think if the Cowboys can get there they have a good shot.
The first home game is mid-August. I didn't know if you wanted to go or not?
I think I would like to see how they do in training camp and maybe wait for a few games.
They always seem to play better once they get the hang of everything and everyone.
I can not wait to see what Dak brings to the field this year.
Man last year was crazy when he and Zeke was just killing everyone.
Oh I was loving see them run all over the teams at the games.
Just like old times with Irving and Aikman!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Jim, why so glum?
You can tell I'm depressed?
Yeah. It's pretty obvious.
How do you mean?
You look horrible. You haven't showered of shaved all week.
I haven't felt like it.
Your living room is a mess.
Really? I hadn't noticed.
You still have two have-eaten pizzas on the table
I haven't felt like finishing them.
You are still wearing the same closes you had on last Sunday!
It's my football outfit.
Yeah, I could tell by the helmet you are wearing.
It protects me from concussions.
Concussion?  Dude, you have to move from your recliner to get a concussion.
I suppose so.
And there is one more thing that I noiced.
What's that?
You still are wearing the body paint you were wearing while we watched the Superbowl together last Sunday. You are painted completely blue, except for the enormous horse shoe painted on your chest.
The Colts were so close to winning it all, and then the season ended. The thought of having to wait months until the next season starts is just too depressing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
Oh I love it!
Wait you mean the NFL right?
Naw man!
Oh you like soccer...
Yea!
Well I meant the NFL
No I'm all for European Football
Well do you ever watch the NFL?
It looks too boring!
It is definitely not boring!
Well it could be more intense!
How do you say that?
It just seems too much planning
Oh so the pacing?
Yea it seems slow!
It's really intense though when they are on the clock!
Yea I can agree to an extent
You should give it another try
I may!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the rookies in the NFL last year?
I think that they didn't perform very well
I agree, off the top of my head I can only remember Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot
Yeah, I really don't remember anyone else
Did Carson Wentz start playing last year?
Actually I think you are right
Yeah he did alright with the Eagles
It's surprising too because he came from a small university
Yeah I guess there's talent everywhere you look if you look hard enough
I bet a team wishes they get good rookies for the new year
Yeah it's really important to have refreshing talent on your team
They can go very far with good rookies
They can also bargain their rookies with other veteren players.
Rookies often don't last too long in the year though
I think your right, a startling number of them are injured and out of the league early
Yeah but the minimum salary I believe is around 400k/year
That is still a lot of money but the best players get paid so much more
But they probably should
But the disparity is so large, it should be a little closer together
That may happen in the nearby future
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of Roger Goodell?
Well everyone seems to hate him, so I guess I'm initially not too favorable towards him.
Yeah, he definitely takes a beating in the media, and it's always fun to see him get booed at the NFL draft.
Yup. But why is he so hated?
I don't think most people actually have specific reasons for hating him - but I know many were upset about how he has handled the Ray Rice scandal.
Yeah that was shameful. Ray Rice knocked her out cold. That was disgusting.
Yeah, and he's still trying to come back into the NFL, but with no success.
Yeah that would be a PR nightmare for whoever would sign him.
Well, Adrian Peterson was forgiven.
I mean, that's barely the same thing. But yeah I guess maybe Ray Rice's play has something to do with it too.
Yeah I think if you can still produce, someone in the NFL will give you a job. Look at PacMan Jones, he's still around.
Wow, I guess he is, but he isn't in the news as much anyone
I guess that's a good thing for him though, right? Haha where's he even playing these days? Cincy?
Ha, Cincy would make sense and I think that's right.
That Cincinnati team seems infamous for having players who get in trouble.
Like who else?
Well they drafted Chris Henry back in the day. Chad Johnson. And now they draft Joe Mixon!
Wow. They really did take Mixon didn't they. That's nuts. However Chad Johnson, or should I Say OchoCinco, wasn't a bad guy. He just got fined a lot.
Yeah I guess youre right, which brings us back to Goodell. I think he shouldn't fine people for celebrating.
Yeah he must think NFL stands for the 'no fun league'
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like in the NFC this year to go to the Superbowl?
I think the Cowboys have a good shot to win the NFC championship.
What about the Greenbay Packers?
They should be pretty good if they can stay healthy.
The Panthers should be tough as well.
Cam Newton is always good.
Do you think that the Patriots can get back to the Superbowl?
Yes, they are always the team to beat in the AFC.
Tom Brady is going to stick around until he wins at least two more superbowls?
He never seems to get old.
Brady just keeps getting better and better with age!
Tom Brady is the best quarterback in the history of the NFL.
How do you like the Redskins chances this year?
The NFC East is going to be tough.
The Cowboys should be the favorite to win the NFC east.
Dak Prescot is a great young quarterback.
The Giants and Eagles are much better than they were last year.
The Eagles have a really good young quarterback too.
How do you like the Raiders this year?
They should be really good because they have a lot to play for and have another really good young quarterback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The most glorious feeling in the world is the feeling you get on Sunday morning in September.
Are you a church-goer?
Church is great and all, but that's not what I'm talking about.
What are you alking about?
The sun rises on a field of green, coveed with cold, crisp morning dew.
That is nice.  Nature...
That's not what I'm talking about.
What?
The smell of fresh cut grass, and a wide open field, quietly waiting for the violence of the day.
Now you've lost me...
A line of cars filled with painted faces, coolers full of refreshments, and RVs stocked with bar-b-que.
The county fair?
A parking lot filled with people, anticipating the excitement about to unfold, and the smell of sunscreen and muscle cream in the air.
A sporting event?
Not just a sporting event...THE SPORTING EVENT!
The Olympics?
And the growing creshendo of voices, enthusiatically calling, "Let the game begin!"
Football!
Not just football...NFL football!  My "raison d'être!"
A chill just went down my spine!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Go Browns!
Wow, a Browns fan!
There are a few of us left!
I'm a Bills man myself.
Anyone but Patriots is all right with me.
Well you'll get no argument from me.
Hoping they lose at Denver this season.
Hear, hear.
You nervous about your first timer?
McDermott? Nah, he'll do fine.
Win early and you might have a shot this year!
Wish I could say the same for you...
Hey, this is gonna be our year!
I don't know-- think you can top Christmas Eve?
Two Christmas Eves this year!
I mean you got Peppers, good job there
And our offense is tight.
Hey, you gotta believe, right?
Woof woof!
Back atcha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow the NFL draft at all?
No, not really, It's three days of shenanigans and fifteen minutes between picks is insane.
Plus, all the trading is hard to keep track of.
I feel bad for the fans, seeing their hopes get dashes when the team picks someone the instantly trade them for two picks in the next around.
I watch sometimes.
Why? Seems taxing.
It is, I'll usually have the draft on in the background while doing work.
I'll look at the results at the end, especially if one of my college teams has someone making it.
Which teams?
Schools I attended or taught at. If a student is projected to go high in the draft, or at all from a small school, I pay attention.
Which schools?
An undergrad without a football team.
That's sad.
It's fine. I studied at Penn State and Cincinnati so I follow the draft if they have someone going in.
Where do you work now?
Eastern Michigan.
How often does the NFL get someone from there?
Every 2-3 years or so, ONE person will be selected.
Do they ever make it big in NFL?
Not really. A lot of them are just defensive players without recognition. Looking to see what Hackenberg does for the Jets next year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the penalties the refs call?
I think the refs do the best they can but they inevitably get some wrong
I would have to agree with you on that
Sometimes the referees determine the entire outcome of the game
Yeah that is the worst thing in my opinion
I think they call penalties a little too much
I agree, they should lay off the whistle a little bit
They are trying to make the game safer though
I feel like it really isn't working all the well though
Yeah, a lot of big name players still get hurt from illegal plays every year
I feel bad for those players
Luckily though, some get to rest with their millions of dollars
It still doesn't make it fair though because they are losing money
Yeah that is true, I wonder if they recieve workman's compensation
They probably get free medical care from their team
They certainly do
I hate it when coaches lie about player injuries so that they can play
It's selfish and irresponsible
I hope the league moves toward a more technology based method of detecting penatlies
And I hope those changes reduce the amount of injuries in the league.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Gayle Sayers might have that Concussion Condition that football eventually get?
No I didn't hear that. That's sad.
Yeah it seems like more and more football players are being diagnosed and affected with it.
You know it should be expected that players eventually will have that condition.
Oh yeah? Why do you say that?
Football is a full contact sport.
But the players wear helmets and pads to protect themselves.
People wear condoms not to get a disease or to cause a pregnancy but it happens.
Is that the best analogy you got?
I'm just saying with all that tackling and head butting there's bound to be some consequences.
Yeah you right about that. But the pro-
The problem is the league should have and should now protect their players even more.
You're saying a football helmet is not enough to protect the players?
That's exactly what I'm saying!
So what should the football team owners do?
Past or present football team owners?
Both! They're both affected aren't they?
Yes they are. Very much so....
So what should they do?
Pay their past players what they're worth. Start by providing lifetime Health Insurance so those players affected with the condition can live a worthwhile productive life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big football fan?
Yes, I watch NFL games a fair amount.
Who is your favorite team?
Probably the Atlanta Falcons. What about you?
Oh the Falcons. That was such a sad Super Bowl.
It really was. Did you watch it?
A little bit. It was rather depressing.
I could not believe they blew such a big lead.
I know. What was the score again?
The Falcons were up by 19 before the last quarter!
Oh, that's right!
Yep, and then the Patriots scored 19 points in the last quarter.
Tom Brady is a pretty great player.
I guess. I am still bitter about that game!
Where was that Super Bowl held?
It was in Houston, Texas.
Oh you're right. How many Super Bowls have the Patriots won now?
I believe this was their fifth.
I think you are correct.
Hopefully the Falcons will be good next year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I certainly miss the old coach post game meltdowns.
Definitely. They made for good entertainment. Seems like a coach hasn't melted down for a while.
You're right. The last big one was the Dennis Green meltdown and that was nearly a decade ago.
The Bears are who we thought they were. Oh, that was grand.
It definitely was. Sorry to see Dennis Green pass away. Guy was really a good guy who will always be remembered by that meltdown.
Yes, unfortunate. He seemed like a good man.
Nobody was better than Jim Mora.
Jim Mora was the king of the meltdown. I miss him.
Coaches don't have diddly poo on Jim Mora in terms of postgame interviews.
They definitely don't. Everyone always think the Playoff one was the best, but I'm more of a diddly poo fan.
The guy ripped his players, coaching staff, and threw everyone including himself under the bus in that rant.
He said, "we sucked". You never hear a coach say that.
Guy was definitely honest. He was a good coach and will always be overshadowed by his rants.
Good to be remembered by something, I guess.
Not as brutally honest as that coach for the Buccaneers back in the 1970's.
Who was that?
John McKay. A reporter asked about his teams execution and he said he was all for it.
Oh, no way. That's crazy and hilarious at the time.
The Buccaneers were historically bad back in the 1970's.
They were bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, Seattle is really going to have to play defense if they expect to win.
Yea, they may not fill up the score board anymore.
Exactly! And without Marshawn Lynch, they have no goal line punch.
Yea, it might be tough without him, but they will manage.
I would personally look out for San Francisco this year.
You would? Is that a joke?
Yea, it is. They are going no where.
I was starting to wonder what happened to you.
Yea, I do not actually think they have a prayer. They have nothing.
Yea, well at least they do not have Chip anymore. That guy just didn't have it at this level.
Yea, he kinda succeeded his first year and then fizzled.
Yea, thats what the guy seems to do. He just got gradually worse.
Yea, we will see if he ends up back in the league.
That is true. I think his chances of getting back are the same as Tim Tebow's.
Yea, both have almost no chance.
Yea, I agree. Its sad for both
Yea, maybe one day they will both resurface.
I wouldn't count on it. I'll tell you that!
Yea, I agree. They were one year wonders.
Hey! Maybe Tebow can crack the Mets roster though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're a big sports buff right? Which are your favorite sports?
I like soccer, football, and basketball.
I like watching those sports, and baseball too.
Baseball is too slow-paced for me.
What do you know about sports history?
I know the backgrounds of football and basketball.
Tell me a little something about football.
The U.S. has a national football league, the NFL which started in the 1920s.
I think that makes it younger than basketball.
Jim Thorpe was the first president, and at the time there were only 14 teams.
So a relatively small league.
That's true. Of the original 14 teams, the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals are left.
Interesting fact. Where did the league get its start?
In a Canton, Ohio automobile showroom.
That sounds a little like an American legend.
Well I think that original meeting place must have fit the bill.
And Ohio is somewhat in or near the heart of America.
We have American football, and then there are other versions of football.
Its an extremely popular sport.
And the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals are still big rivals!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football this year?
I'm more ready for NFL than any of the college teams.
Why is that?
I just prefer people who play professionally. They seem to have their ducks in a row.
Who is your favorite team?
The Steelers.
Me too. I really do think that they will need to have a team rebuild here pretty soon.
What makes you think that?
Well Ben Roethlisberger seems to be getting old along with a lot of the defensive line.
I guess you are right, the key players are about to retire soon.
They do have a few new guys like Antonio Brown who actually do a decent job though.
Do you think they will do better than what they did last season?
Well they went 11-5 which isn't bad but they could always improve.
They were first in their conference, weren't they?
They were, yes, but their other competitors kept them from going to the Super Bowl.
They have won six of them already though, you cannot say that they don't have the potential.
I would never doubt my team. This year should be vastly different for them.
I sure hope you are right.
A saying that I have kept to me since I have been to Pittsburgh, "Stairway to Seven"
I sure hope the seventh comes this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for NFL this fall?
Yes! I've been waiting since the Super Bowl in February.
What's the team you follow?
The Dallas Cowboys are my team of choice.
Who are your favorite players?
Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott make a great team.
What school did Elliot come from?
The Ohio State University.
Oh yeah.  Will they make it to the Super Bowl this year?
I certainly hope so, because they were so close last year.
Well, I'll be waiting for the underdogs to make it this year.
Who do you mean? Detroit?
No, the Cleveland Browns.
Wow! That would be a miracle.
We need some different teams to make it all the way.
The NFL DOESNT
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Eagles will do against the rest of the NFC East this year?
Its hard to say- I think so much of last year was spent fixing the Chip Kelly disaster
Yea, I'm still not completely sure about Doug Pederson
I mean, he managed the team way better than Chip, but after so many years of dominance with Andy Reid, he has large shoes to fill
I'm excited the performance of Carson Wentz in his rookie year
Me too- he set the record for most completed passes in a rookie season- I can't wait until he has more experience under his belt
The organization also went out and got some offensive help which is really exciting.
Yea, remember when we had such all-star receives like Owens and Desean Jackson
Its such a help for any quarterback, but especially a young one- I'm glad they are spending money
Yea Jeffrey was like the number one free agent and the Eagles picked him up!
Between him and Torrey Smith we should have some great WR targets for Wentz
They also got Blount to help with our run game
Yea, that will be exciting to have a big, tough running back
Sproles is good, but he is small so you can't use him in every situation.
Plus all these offensive weapons are veterans- which will help Wentz
I think these decisions bode well for the next couple of years as far as building a winning sustainable team
I just hope our defense gets better this year too
Yes, we need to work on that. We used to have such an imposing secondary- its what we were known for.
Ah yes, sheldon brown, brian dawkins, troy vincent, trent cole....reggie white!
Yea they made defense fun to watch!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football is my favorite sport
Oh, its mine too
Its such a great game
So exciting
Definitely
I love everything about it
Me too
And there are so many great teams in the nfl
Exactly
I love the 49ers
They are a pretty good team
Who do you like
Panthers
Oh i like them too
Sometimes it is hard to have one favorite team
I agree
Cowboys are pretty good too
They are
Alot of people hate on them
I dont kmow why
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you  been paying attention to the news coming from the all team practices?
Not as much as most people, but I have a pretty good idea about most of the teams.
What do you think about the news about the Bronco's?
I think they had that one run two seasons ago, and now they have to slow down to train up all the new guys they have.
Yeah, that's true. I like what I'm hearing about the Bucaneers so far.
Yeah, it seems like Winston has really stepped up during this offseason.
Do you think they can take the NFC South?
I don't know. If Carolina comes out like they are capable of then there won't be much contest.
What do you mean? The Saints are still in that division.
When was the last time they had a chance though?
That's true. And you know last season was a total fluke for Atlanta.
Oh yeah, they won't be back in the post season for a few years.
Matt Ryan just doesn't have it in him. They got lucky that the rest of the division was sort of crappy.
It's funny that we get that, but actual Falcon fans would beg to differ.
Yeah, but when was the last time you listened to someone from Georgia anyway?
I'd have to say never.
Agreed. And of course you can't talk about a football season without bringing up New England.
Oh please, we were well on our way before you said that.
It's totally possible that they come out and win, even if that's not what you want to watch all season.
It's never what I want to watch, but sometimes you just have to accept the inevitable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The packers have to be looking for a new QB soon
Why would you think that?
Rodgers is getting up there in age
No I think he is playing just like he should be
Yeah but you always have to look to the future
They were just fine when Favre exited
But can they really hit it on the head with 3 QBs in a row?
They draft very well.
So you think they already drafted their guy?
No I think they will address it in a few years.
Do you think theyll have him sit like they did with Rodgers and Favre?
It really could go either way, like what happened with the Colts.
I think that was pure luck, no pun intended
Yeah they did get lucky but at the same time had to sit through a dreadful season
That doesnt seem to happen in Green Bay
It did when they Had Scott Tolzien starting
Forgot about that year
Yeah so they could be looking.
They seem to be in it every year though
Thats because of the depth the franchise has.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Dallas Cowboys?
They are the best.
Their web site is dallascowboys.com.
I'll check it out.
They used to play in Cotton Bowl Stadium.
That's in the Fair Park part of Dallas.
Then they moved to Irving Texas.
Yeah they got another stadium.
Then they moved to Arlington.
I liked it when Tom Landry was their coach.
They won several Super Bowls back then.
And Tony Dorsett was quarterback.
I liked Tony Romo.
Their main office is at Valley Ranch.
I think that is in Irving Texas.
They were established in 1960.
That's 57 years ago.
They play at AT&T Stadium now.
Actually their new headquarters is in The Ford Center at The Star.
That's in Frisco Texas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What good quarterback will never win a Super Bowl?
Matt Stafford.
No? Why not?
He plays for Detroit.
Is that it? They're pretty decent.
Well for one, they feel snakebitten.
Yeah, 0-16 puts a pall on one's franchise.
But also, look at their division.
Green Bay, Minnesota and Chicago.
Yeah. That's a tough division.
Except Chicago.
Right, but Green Bay is great and the Vikings are on the rise.
They're sneakily good.
So I think that's a tough road ahead of them.
I can see that.
Plus, they've lost Megatron, and he was huuuge in that offense.
They've got Reggie Bush though.
He's had some lucky years there, but their RBs are snakebitten too.
I suppose, yeah.
And there's still no replacement for Johnson.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read a ranking list of the best football players ever. Guess who was number one?
Not Tom Brady?
No, he was number seven. But he's still playing, maybe he can work his way up.
Okay, how about Joe Montana?
No, close. He was number three. But he is really well known when people talk about the greatest players.
Okay, how about Peyton Manning?
Nope, he was like number ten or something. Although he WAS a great quarterback.
Brett Favre was a great quarterback.
Yes he was. But he was even further down the list than Manning.
Dan Marino was another great quarterback.
He was down on the list too. The greatest player listed was not a quarterback.
Really? What position did the greatest player play?
Wide receiver. Now that's a good hint, since there wasn't a lot of those on the top of the list.
Hmm, Calvin Johnson was a wide receiver.
He was way down on the list. You gotta think old timers.
Randy Moss was a wide receiver. Not him?
Nope. It was Jerry Rice.
Wow, Rice was considered the greatest player of all time?
Yep, and number two was Walter Payton.
I always liked Walter Payton, he was a great player to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Browns are going to do this season?
You already know the answer to that.
Yeah, but they could improve.
They are the worst team in the league.
Brock Osweiler might start as quarterback though, and he was pretty good for the Broncos.
The Cleveland Browns only won one game last season. They are hopeless.
You're being so cynical.
The only time the Browns were enjoyable to watch in the past decade was when Brian Hoyer played for them.
Yeah, he was pretty good.
Yep. They almost won half of their games when they had him.
I guess you're right. The Browns aren't a very good team.
They can't seem to get it together.
I just wish they would at least win against the Steelers every season.
Ah, the old Steelers vs Browns rivalry.
It's so frustrating whenever the Steelers win.
I wonder when Ben Roethlisberger is going to retire.
I don't know. How old is he now?
He's got to be close to 40. He's played for a while now.
True. I wonder who was the oldest football player to retire.
I don't know. Peyton Manning seemed pretty old when he retired at 39.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XX.
Who played in that one?
The New England Patriots against the Chicago Bears.
First time for each?
Yes.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Jim McMahon for the Bears and Tony Eason for the Patriots.
Who scored first?
New England, a field goal after a Bears fumble.
What was the score after the first quarter?
13-3, Bears.
And at the half?
23-3, Bears.
Who did the halftime show?
Up with People, once again.
How did the third quarter go?
The Bears scored 21 unanswered points, making it 44-3.
What was the final score?
46-10, Bears.
Poor New England.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bro, you ready for football?
Heck yes! Who you got winning this year?
I got the Minnesota Vikings! No ones going to stop that defense.
You're funny! They'll never make it past Aaron Rodgers! He's the best in that division!
Don't count Sam Bradford out. He's a poor man's Aaron Rodgers but we have a better defense than those cheeseheads!
Yea, right! Who do you think taking the AFC conference?
Either the Raiders or the Patriots.
Me, too. But, that's only if Brady and Carr make it through the whole season.
Yea Carr got hurt last year and Brady's getting old too.
True but you can never count the G.O.A.T Tom Brady out.
Yea, the cheating Patriots never fails.
Call them cheaters all you want but they're the best in history.
I don't know. You still have the Packers, Steelers, and Niners if you're talking history.
After this season, Patriots will be the sure best.
Yea, stop living in the past.
Don't forget about Atlanta, too.
That's funny! Go to the Super Bowl to only spoil the lead.
That was just bad coaching.
Should have killed time instead of throwing it.
Man, the nfl is rigged!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just ordered some football tickets for next season.
for the detroit Lions?
Yes, they are our home team after all.
I don't know, they sure aren't the Denver Broncos!
I know the superbowl was great last year.
You know, I only watch it for the commercials.
Oh c'mon you know you think Matthew Stafford is hot.
Yes, he is and he is a team leader.
I really get sick of people bashing the lions.
Well they have been in last place alot.
Yes, but they are getting better.
I know, they were so much better last season.
Yes, they were, you know I had seats that were fantastic right on the 50 yard line last year.
I know, thats the game where they played the packers.
I know, that game was off the hook, you should've gone, you may have even liked it.
Um, you took Matt remember?
I know but what game do you want to go to this year?
Can I check the schedule and let you know?
Sure, just let me know.
Ok, I'll call you later this week/
XXXXXXXXXXX
How exciting will the Panthers be this year?
It depends. How good is DA?
DA? Who is DA?
Panthers backup quarterback Derrick Anderson.
What does he matter?
What does he matter? He's Cam's backup, his support system. Without him the whole thing goes down.
Does he really matter that much?
He threw that interception against the Seahawks.
Yes, I remember that now. That game wasn't close though.
It was like 44 to 8, yes, though that was the first play of the game.
How is Tolbert doing?
He's doing well. It's nice to see him playing again.
He is kind of large, right?
Yes, that's accurate. He weighs 243 pounds.
I don't know if that's large. Cam Newton weighs 245.
They're that close? I wouldn't have guessed.
I know right?
Exactly. He just is taller.
Yes, I would say so. He's faster too.
That would be an interesting race.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the NFL to start!
Yeah, It is going to surely be exciting!
Do do think the Pats can pull it off again?
That is a great question. They surely loaded up the Brinks Truck!
The dude they pulled in from New Orleans is going to be dynamite!
He might even be a reasonable facsimile of Randy Moss.He name is Brandin Cooks. Fast!
Well, how about some of the other teams in the AFC? How do you like Carr, and the Raiders.
I think they are a real threat as long as he stays healthy.
That was just a freak injury he'll be fine.
It just shows how valuable he is. Without him, the Raiders got blown out in the playoffs.
The steelers will always be tough. Timeline always seems to get those guys to play.
Agreed! They got some young guys on defense. The guys they had last year just couldn't get it done.
They drafted Watt's little brother and Cameron Sutton, a cornerback from Tennessee. They will be a lot better right there.
Well, it won't be enough to overtake the Patriots.They loaded up on defense too.
They picked up LB Harris from the Jets, and he was really good last year. They also scooped up Stephon Gilmore from Buffalo.
I know, they gave him 15M a year.Bet that has to make Malcolm Butler Happy. He is playing for under 4M this year.
Well, he will get his payday next year.All of the good ones do!
God, we didn't even have time to talk about the NFC!
They will be interesting too this year. Green Bay and Dallas look dominant!
The back from Dallas has only been in the league for a year.It seems like he is in a little trouble.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I also like the Dallas Cowboys.
There defense if going to have to play better than last season.
I don't think the defense is going to matter much.
You win championships with defense.
I don't know last year your Patriots won by scoring points.
True, but they also shut out the Falcons in the second half of the super bowl.
I am sure the Cowboys will have a better defense than last years Patriots.
Why would you think that?
Because they drafted Taco Charlton.  How could you not believe in a guy named Taco.
One guy don't make a defense.
They think they drafted well on the defensive secondary also.
It is hard to trust a rookie is going to make a big difference.
Don't tell that to Dak Prescott and Ezekial Elliott.
That was lighting in a bottle and not something you should expect every year.
I still think they have to be considered front runners for the Super Bowl.
It is a long season and they have to avoid the injuries.
That is true with any team plus I think they have solid depth.
That is how the Patriots are so good year in and year out.
They are a very deep team but they are getting old.
People say that every season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the NFL's age limit for the draft?
Remind me again what it is.
The rule says they can't draft a player who isn't equivalent to a junior or senior in college.
Ooh, this rule. Controversial, I remember.
Go ahead.
They should be able to draft anyone they want. If someone is 20 and able to transition easily, go for it.
What about education?
What do you mean?
They basically abandon their education.
So what if they do? They'll make $10 million and then finish as they retire.
It sets a bad example.
If you're letting your kids use NFL players as role models, you're a bad parent.
Ha, that's actually mean but kind of true.
A lot of these kids need to get drafted sooner because their family is so impoverished.
But if they get hurt?
If they get hurt early and ruin their NFL careers, so be it. It's a sport, not a job.
You're harsh.
I'm opportunist. A company should be able to hire whomever they think will do the best. So what if they're 19?
I don't know. Their bodies aren't ready for it.
The only issue is they CAN'T return to college after declaring. I hate it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the start of the season?
Yes I am!
Who do you think will win it all this year?
I think the Patriots will repeat as Super Bowl champs.
Isn't Tom Brady getting a little old?
He's still in the prime of his career.
Who do you think is the underdog team to make the playoffs?
I like the 49ers.
What about the Titans?
They could do it.
Do you think Marcus Mariota could get MVP?
Nope, I think Brady will get it again.
Do you think about any team besides the Patriots?
There isn't another team worth thinking about.
There are plenty of other teams worth thinking about.
Not with 6 Super Bowl Rings.
What about the Steelers, Cowboys, or 49ers?
They still don't have 6 Superbowl Rings.
I think the Titans will win it all.
We'll see at the end of the season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Pete, what do you think of the Philadelphia Eagles this year?
The Eagles?  Oh man, I hope they tank.
Yeah, me too.  They are my least favorite team?
Mine too.  Why do you dislike them so much?
Mainly because they are in the same division as the Cowboys, who are my favorite team.
Thats a good reason, I guess.
That and they are really just very unlikeable.  They seem dirty.
Dirty as in unclean??
No dirty, as in I think they don't necessarily follow the rules.
Oh, ok.  I don't like them because I don't like the color green.
Ha ha, that's not a good reason not to like a team.
Sure it is.
Wow, then who is your favorite team?
Um, I like the New York Giants.
The New York Giants?? Why on Earth do you like the Giants.
I like them because they wear blue.
Oh wow, you can't be serious!
I am serious.
So you don't like the Eagles because they wear green and you like the Giants because you like blue.
Exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can anyone beat the Patriots this season?
It's rare for a team that's so strong on paper to win the Super Bowl, so we'll see.
They added so many good pieces to an already great lineup!
Yeah, they're a lock for the playoffs every year as it is given the perennial weak teams in the AFC East.
And now they have Brandin Cooks, Rex Burkhead, and Mike Gillislee as more pieces to that elite offense.
Brady's gonna have a hard time messing that up - 40 years old or not.
Plus, the defense is improved too. They signed Stephon Gilmore and David Harris.
Kony Ealy, too. There aren't many weaknesses on this team, that's for sure.
It makes me wonder if the Pats do win it all, will Brady hang it up?
It would give him and Belichick six Super Bowls apiece, best duo of all-time.
They sealed their places in NFL immortality with that crazy overtime win in last year's Super Bowl.
No doubt. Others may have had better stats, like Peyton Manning, but give me Brady in a big game.
Seeing the Pats make all these moves during the offseason makes me wonder if they're going all-in this season.
Well they have Jimmy Garoppolo waiting in the wings and he can probably lead the team at this point.
Especially with the talent up and down the roster.
He's a free agent after this season, isn't he?
Yes, and I have to think that he'll be highly coveted if he enters free agency.
Would the Patriots put the franchise tag on him?
Only if Brady retires.
But he says he'll play until he's 45, it will be fun to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?
I don't think they will be great.
So you think they will be good?
They are always good, but I don't think they can win the Super Bowl.
They finally got rid of Tony Romo.
Tony Romo has been overrated his whole career.
Romo has been a good quarterback.
He's always injured!
Well, if the Cowboys had a good offensive he wouldn't get injured.
The Cowboys have a really good offensive line.
Then why was Romo always injured?
I think it's because some players are just injury prone.
What do you think about Dak Prescott?
Hard to tell after 1 year.
I think Dak will be a good quarterback.
I think he will be good but I need to see another year to really say.
Didn't Dak get in trouble this off season?
Yeah, for using a robot to sign his autograph.
Well, at least, it wasn't something like drugs.
Yeah for a Cowboys player using a robot to sign your autograph is pretty tame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the greatest quarterback of all time is?
That's a tough one. I don't know if it's Manning or Montana for me.
What about Brady?
What about him?
You don't think he deserves to be in the conversation?
Nope. I think if he would've had the same career without the controversy we'd have that conversation.
You're crazy, what controversy?
Where have you been? Deflategate, spy gate, do those ring a bell?
Let's be honest here though, none of those determined whether or not Brady won the games.
Are you kidding me? How is cheating not related to gaining an unfair advantage over the other team?
Because even if those events wouldn't have happened Brady still would have won.
You don't know that.
And you don't know that he would've lost if he didn't.
I have a pretty good idea.
I guess we'll never know, so until that happens he's a winner.
Yea, winner with an asterisk.
Come on, hes the greatest quarterback of all time.
No, he's the greatest QB who had to resort to cheating.
So you don't think he would've won the same without cheating?
No I do not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season
Me either
Pre season is only like a month away
Yea, but it really means nothing
I know and the first strings only play the first quarter
Well, they do have to check out the rookies and see who is in and who is out
Yeah, it will be interesting to see who makes the cut
So, do they let some people go after the first couple games and then the rest after the next two games?
I am really not sure how that works, I do know that they have two cuts before regular season.
I knew that, I was just wondering when the cuts are.
So, now I just read, that instead of two cuts, it is now only going to be one cut.
Oh, still the same 90 to 53 all at once?
Yup, I just read that on the internet
Oh wow, I wonder why they are doing it that way now
I am not sure, it states that the rosters will be down to 53 no later than 4 pm ET on Sept 3rd. right before the regular season.
Well, those rookies are going to really have to play their butts off then
Yes they well, must be really nerve wrecking to wonder if you are going to stay or go
I bet, when they play they are sweating two fold.
Yes, I bet they are.
Well, all I can say is good luck to all the NFL rookies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the NFL Special Documentary?
No, i missed it.
It was awesome!
What did it cover?
The inside perspective of Everything NFL.
Even the locker rooms?
ESPECIALLY the locker rooms!
I'm going to Netflix it.
You should.  Also talked about finances.
Really?
They said that most NFL players go broke after retirement.
I've heard that.
New programs are in place to help them with that.
Especially the newbies.
I'm sure they can all benefit.
Any interviews?
Oh, plenty.
The players and the coaches?
And the trainers, wives and everyone else!
I've saved it on my iPad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The one nice thing about summer ending will be it means football season starts.
That's true. I can't wait for the hot weather to go.
I know, another six weeks of this weather, and then we can cool down and sit on the couch on Sundays and watch a game.
I wonder who's first on the line-up schedule?
I already checked! The first game is Thursday September seventh with the Pats against the Chiefs.
New England will be very popular again this year.
Sunday September tenth will really kick it off with thirteen teams playing.
Wow, how do you choose who to watch?
I know. The Steelers versus the Browns should be a good game.
The Steelers are always popular.
There's also the Colts playing against the Rams.
Colts have a very devoted fan base.
So do the Seahawks, and they're playing the Packers.
I hope the Seahawks have a good season this year.
And then there's the Giants playing the Cowboys.
That should be a good game.
It always looks so promising for the teams in the beginning, but then it really quick starts to fall apart, and you can see who's going to end up on top and who isn't.
I know, but that's what makes the beginning of the season so exciting, seeing how well they come out of the gate.
Thank God for cable tv and the internet. You can watch all kinds of football all season long.
I know what you mean, I love the sports channels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXVIII.
Who played in that one?
Dallas versus Buffalo.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Troy Aikman for Dallas and Jim Kelly for Buffalo.
Where was it played?
The Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
Who were the broadcasters?
Dick Enberg and Bob Trumpy.
Who sang the National Anthem?
Natalie Cole.
What was the halftime score?
13-6, Buffalo, actually.
Who played at halftime?
A lot of country singers - Clint Black, Tanya Tucker, Wynonna and Naomi Judd.
How did the third quarter go?
Dallas scored 14 points, unanswered.
And the fourth?
Dallas scored ten unanswered points.
Buffalo lost the Superbowl four times!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so looking forward to seeing the Vikings play this year.
My family are crazed Vikings fans from way back.
I didn't know you liked football.
I don't - I said my family were crazed fans.
Ah.
I remember back in the day when pro football players looked like little kids.
What do you mean?
Take a look back at photos from the Fran Tarkenton days.
What am I looking for?
You'll see what a pro athlete looks like when they are NOT using steroids.
What?
Take out your phone and Google Fran Tarkenton/Vikings/1970s and see what I mean.
Wow, he looks like a 15 year old!
Yeah, and a 15 year old without huge muscles and a neck that's three feet thick.
I see what you mean.
Back then Bud Grant worked them hard and seemed to like making them uncomfortable.
How so?
He didn't allow heaters for the outside games. Some got frostbite.
Man, today's athletes are a bunch of coddled babies.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does the NFL have a concussion problem?
Yes, they definitely do. They have admitted it.
Wow, that's scary!
It is. Many of the players are at risk -- especially in the long term.
Even after they have played?
Yes, it appears to be a life-long risk.
What are the risks?
Retired players are at risk for brain disease. This disease may cause them to become suicidal.
It's even worse than I thought!
I know, but they can take steps to prevent concussions.
How so?
First, they need to change the game.
What do you mean?
The game needs to move away from impact and towards skill.
What else can be done?
The equipment needs to be upgraded. While it has become safer, much work remains.
Anything else?
The most important thing is information.
Information?
Yes, the players need to be made aware of the risks. And, they need to better report their symptoms.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Dolphins stand a chance this year?
honestly, I do.
Why, did they even make the playoffs last year?
They sure did, they played in the first round against the Steelers.
Oh yea, they lost that game. So what makes you think anything will be different next year?
Well look at how they did it last year. They had a rookie head coach in Adam Gase.
True, but that doesn't mean anything.
Do you remember how they started out?
Terribly if I recall correctly.
You do, they started out with a 1-4 record.
Oh yea, then won a bunch right?
True story, they won 9 of their next ten games and made the playoffs.
That is fairly impressive.
Exactly, and they secured most of their core players from last season for this upcoming season.
Did they get any big names.
Not this year, but I think that's a huge difference, they don't need playmakers, they need team players.
Don't they have Suh on the D-line?
They sure do, he's a monster.
Yea he is, nobody is running him over.
Nope, he does the running over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how do you think the Texans will do this year?
I think they are going to be pretty good since they got rid of Oswyler and drafted DeShawn Watson.
Yea, I think the defense will be better since JJ Watt is healthy.
Wade Phillips taking full control of the defense should definitely help.
Well what do you think it will take for the offense to get better?
If Fuller can just not drop so many passes and if Watson starts I think that would help.
Oh yea and if Lamar Miller can actually find a hole to run through!
Yea, since they upgraded the O-line this year.
What do you think about Oakland relocating out to Las Vegas?
I don't know, I wonder how being in Vegas will affect betting on the games.
Do you think Oakland will get another NFL team?
I don't think so since San Diego just went to LA so now there are 2 teams in that area.
So who do you think will end up in the Super Bowl this year?
I think it will be the Patriots and the Falcons again.
So do you think the Falcons would choke again and blow a 2nd half lead?
No, I think they win this year because Matt Ryan is a more confident player now.
Yea, the Patriots did lose some good players and Brady is getting older.
Yep, and Atlanta picked up a lot of good players this year.
So what do you think the final score will be?
27-14 Atlanta!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you collect football memoribilia?
Yes, how about you?
Sure, it's fun.
What is your favorite memoribilia?
I'd have to say my signed Franco Harris football.
That's incredible!
I was so lucky to get that piece.
You bet.
My other favorite piece is the signed Joe Namath jersey.
Wow, you're kidding me?
It was very expensive, but I got it.
My favorite memoribilia is my signed Ron Jaworski jersey.
Wow, how did you get that?
I got that at a sporting event years ago.
You must be lucky.
Yeah, I won that one.
I like auctions because you can get a lot of stuff there.
Those are exciting.
I love bidding!
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So let me ask you, which conference do you think is stronger: AFC or NFC?
NFC. It has so many strong teams. Packers, Cowboys, Giants, Seahawks, Cardinals....
What? ! I think it's the AFC. It has the Patriots and the Broncos!
Yea, and those are two great teams compared to many great teams in the NFC.
AFC has won the last three Super Bowls.
Yeah, but in the last four Super Bowls, AFC has only sent two different teams.
I guess that is a fair point.
And if you look at the last 10 Super Bowls, NFC has sent 8 different teams, AFC only 5 different teams.
Both conferences are even on Super Bowl wins for those last 10 Super Bowls, though: 5 each.
Yeah. The top AFC teams - Patriots and Broncos - are super strong teams.
What do you think makes them able to stay so strong over multiple years?
At least in the case of the Patriots, they are a very steady team. Same coach, same QB, year in and year out.
Bill Belichick is a very smart coach, yeah. He knows how to manage a team.
He's probably the greatest head coach in NFL history, to be honest.
Which is really saying something when the NFL has had coaches like Lombardi, Landry, Walsh, Shula and Noll.
So you add Belichick together with Tom Brady...
Who is without question the greatest quarterback of all time.
Agreed. You add them together and you have a strong leadership for the team that other players can believe in.
They definitely seem to have a winning attitude around them.
They believe they can win, they work hard towards doing so, and it pays off for them. Absolutely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team do you think will have a breakout season this year?
If I had to make a pick, I would say the Los Angeles Rams.
Interesting, why?
I'm very excited for their new coaches, whether it be Sean McVay or Wade Phillips.
I think that Wade Phillips is great and what he did with Denver's defense in the 2015 season was amazing. I'm less sure about Sean McVay.
Is it because he's still very young?
That's part of it. Also, I don't think what he did with the Washington Redskins was that impressive when you consider the talented players he had and the fact that Jay Gruden is the head coach.
While you are right about Gruden and the talent present in Washington last season, he helped turn Cousins from a mediocre backup to a Pro Bowl caliber quarterback. That's worth something.
Do you think he'll be able to repeat that success with Jared Goff?
I think that he has as a decent chance to do so. If he can make Goff just average, the Rams will be a huge threat given their talent.
Aside from Robert Quinn, what amazing players do they have?
Todd Gurley had a great rookie season and is bound for a bounce back season.
Even if Gurley were to have a great season, which is not guaranteed, the Rams lack a solid wide receiver.
What about Tavon Austin?
He has speed, but he's not great.
All he has to do is be decent and the Rams can copy the Seattle model of just relying on defense and a running game.
You act as if that's easy. Seattle had a proven running back in Marshawn Lynch and the best defensive secondary in the NFL.
I'm not saying that it's easy, but Robert Quinn, Aaron Donald, and Alec Ogletree areas tough as they come.
I guess that they could become more dominant under the direction of Wade Phillips. I just don't see a strong defensive secondary yet.
I'm not overly concerned about that. Wade Phillips does a great job of getting the most out of his defensive secondaries.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I bet I know more about superbowl championships than you do.
You're on. Go ahead, ask me any year and I'll tell you the champions.
Ok, who won in 1994?
Easy, Dallas.
And where did they play?
Tempe. My turn,  who were the champs in 1987?
The Giants.
Who did they play against?
Buffalo.
And where did they play?
Tampa.
Wpw, ok you're pretty good. Go ahead, your turn.
Thanks, but now let's see how good you really are. 1972.
Hmmm, that's a really long time ago.
Can't do it?
I didn't say that. Dallas beat Miami in New Orleans.
Ok that's really impressive.
Give up?
No, but I think it's fair to say this is a draw.
Ok, fair enough. Draw.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Thursday Night Football. Necessary?
Absolutely not.
Why do you think that?
Well, before "Monday Night Football" and Saturday night sometimes there were more games on sunday.
Yeah, but it was harder to watch all the games on sunday.
Yes, but now with DVR's and NFL Red Zone, you can wach most of the games.
Can't you do the same with the games on different nights?
Yes, but those games cut into other programming i may be recording on those nights.
Hm, interesting point.
If the NFL wants to do different days, push more Pro games on Saturday. College sucks anyway.
College is an industry, i doube they are gonna give up that real estate.
NFL is a bigger industry tho.
True but that's why they divided the weekend up so they can rake in the bucks for the weekend.
Yeah, doesn't mean i have to like it.
So you don't watch any college football?
Nope, doesn't excite me one bit.
That's too bad, there are some good college games out there.
Sorry, the scores and the plays are unrealistic.
You think?
I really do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Phil you been keeping up with NFL lately?
Yeah I've been reading some articles on the draft and some trades, looks like there will be some stacked teams next year.
I know for sure the Steelers have a great squad, and they will be a threat.
I like the Steelers luckily, you a fan of Big Ben?
Are you talking Roethlisberger?
Most definitely man!
Oh yeah I am a huge fan, maybe the best quarterback the Steelers ever had!
He is damn good but don't forget about my buddy Terry Bradshaw.
Terry was a damn beast, definitely clutch in the most important games.
I met Terry as a kid actually, tremendously nice guy!
That is so cool to hear, where did you meet?
I was a kid actor and did some side work, he had a show called 'Home Team' and I was a guest.
That is amazing dude, Terry is the man!
It was a great experience, I've met a few football players actually, all really nice!
Who else did you meet?
One time I actually met Jerry Rice and told him he was the fastest man I'd ever seen catch a ball!
Maybe hyperbole but it made sense at the time I am sure.
Of course, any player you meet becomes the best player ever!
I definitely need to go to a game and meet one of these juggernauts.
Let's get some tickets and take a road trip, maybe Arizona and the Cardinals first game back!
XXXXXXXXXXX
so who is your favorite team?
my favorite is the Houston Texans.
i used to be a fan until Andre Johnson left the team.
he was a huge member of the team so i get that. who do you follow now?
now i follow the Oakland Raiders since i moved to California.
the Raiders are huge in Houston too so i can get that switch.
i remember when i lived in Houston seeing tons of sports bars either having Texans or Raiders gear on the wall. so it helped that i allready knew some names.
well the owner Mark Davis definitely knows what he is doing with marketing the team outside of states.
my favorite is when they both played eachother in Mexico City. that was a great game.
i was disappointed by the Texans losing but in the end it was exciting.
hopefully next season they do something as cool as playing in Mexico.
i hope they go play in Europe, NFL there would kill i think.
as long as they do some more huge teams like the Patriots.
vs Indianapolis or something.
something to make a tense game. like another Texans vs Dallas game.
oh yeah that was a super tense game.
well the rivalry made it so much better.
exactly. NFL needs more rivals.
as long as they are natural.
exactly. if it's not coming from the teams and fans it won't be the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So the first kickoff game of the season is September 7th.
I know I'm just too excited to control myself.
My team plays Sunday against your team!
Hopefully my Packers have stepped their game up and got themselves together.
Just so you know SeaHawks are going to demolish your pretty little Packers.
So who plays the kick off game?
I think the Chiefs vs the Patriots.
That should be a good game.
Yes it should and that's why we should go to the bar to watch it.
Drinks and Football is my type of party.
So do you think you're going to buy tickets this year to see the Packers at Lambeau Field??
Yes of course I am, I'm buying tickets for the game on the 31st and I'm taking my granny for her birthday!
That's the Rams vs the Packers that night right?
Yes it is and that is sure to be one heck of a game.
I know, I should go with you.
Yes you should the tickets are only around 52 bucks per person.
I sure will think about it because there's nothing I love more then watching the Packers lose.
I guess you're not going to have fun because the Packers will be crushing teams all season!
You wish!
No I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where are you from?
I live in Boston now but I'm actually from a town right outside Boston called Foxborough?
That's where the Gillette Stadium is right?
Yes! Have you been to Foxborough??
No, but I've seen it many times on ESPN. Gillette is home to the New England Patriots.
Yes, as a matter of fact it is. So you're a fan of the Patriots?
No. I don't watch much football. My boyfriend watches it all the time and he supports Patriots.
I have been a Patriots fan for many years now. They're the best!
Are they really the best, or do you only support them because they're based in your hometown?
A bit of both I guess. I like being local to my community.
It helps that the team in your community is very popular. My boyfriend has only been supporting them since they won Superbowl a couple years ago.
I support them whether or not they win.
Just to get on my boyfriend's nerve I sometimes say that I'm a Jets fan.
If he's a true Patriots fan he probably gets very angry at you!
Why? I don't get it.
The NY Jets are our enemies! The Jets Vs Patriots is one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL.
Are they any good?
Yes, they are. Not as good the Patriots of course
Oh, of course not!
Patriots til I die!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Monday night football schedule for this year?
I haven't really checked it out yet.
Well week one is the saints at Minnesota.
Nothing big there.
The second game is the chargers at Denver.
That's not really a great game either.
I have to agree with you.
It gets better the following week.
Don't the Giants play?
Yes at home against the lions.
The following week the Cowboys go to Arizona.
Do you think the Cowboys will win the NFC east again?
I don't think so,no.
I think the Giants will be even better.
The Giants defense is going to be dominating.
It could be.
That's the only time the Giants will be on Monday night.
Only one time?
Yes,only one time for the Cowboys too.
That's very unusual.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi
Are you a fan of the NFL?
Yeah love football.
Good me too.
Nice.
Who is your favorite player?
Currently or of all time?
Let's say now.
I really like Eli Manning.
Oh really why?
Well I'm a Giants fan and I have always liked him.
Well that and two super bowl wins can't hurt.
Yeah exactly.
That's cool.
What about you, have a favorite player?
Who's the receiver for the steelers that got in trouble for twerking?
Antonio Brown?
Yeah him, he's great.
Yeah I like him as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you think anyone can beat New England this year?
I think they will lose a couple games.
Do you think they will win the Super Bowl?
Yeah, I don't think anyone can beat them in the playoffs.
That is when things get serious.
Exactly.  They might get so far ahead in the regular season that they rest players so they might lose those.
Yeah.  They lost Gronk last year and still won the Super Bowl.
Exactly.  If they lose Brady, the other teams might have a chance.
Atlanta came pretty closing to beating them in the Super Bowl though.
Atlanta sure did blow it.
Yes they did.  You can't let teams that good hang around like that.
You have to put them away.
New England didn't have Gronk either and still won.
That is amazing.
The Atlanta head coach used to be the Seahawks' defensive coordinatior.
I saw that.
And you know how good the Seahwawk's defense was.
Yeah.  The legion of Boom.
They held New England in check through the first 2.5 quarters.
Then they must fell apart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for another grand season of football?
As long as the Patriots don't win again of course!
Tell me about it. They look even better than last year, which is bothersome and scary.
It seems futile to even sit there and hope they do bad. I don't think it's possible until Brady's gone. If he ever leaves.
Do you think anyone in the AFC can knock them off?
I like to believe that everyone in the AFC West, but the Chargers could do such.
The Broncos have definitely had Brady's number very time he plays them.
He still won against them last season, but that was mostly because poor QB play by the Broncos.
As long as you have a defense like the Broncos you can definitely keep up with Brady.
It's a matter of being proficient and effective in your drives.
Just have 3 or 4 good drives including redzone scores and honestly you can beat them with a Broncos-like defense.
The problem is the Pats defense has random bouts of greatness.
Yeah, it's weird. They had like the 25th best defense, but still won in that comeback victory.
They were getting torched yet for the last quarter and a half shut Matt Ryan out with ease.
Just thinking about that Falcons' choke in the SuperBowl is so depressing.
I think a majority of the country outside of Massachusetts felt that way.
They literally just needed one touchdown and history would have been declined.
I suppose that is what makes them so grace
There really is no denying Brady is the best ever.
I hate to agree with such, but I have to agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love watching football highlights online.
Why? what's the point of rewatching stuff?
I get to see stuff from games I missed.
Is it really that important?
Some of the plays are really amazing!
I guess.
I also love watching old stuff, from guys before my time. Some of them were so talented.
I've never thought about doing that.
I love to do it over the off season, or even on a bye week.
How long do you usually spend watching old clips?
It just depends, anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.
That's a lot!
Yeah I know, but I love it.
Who is your favorite player to watch?
I don't know if I have a favorite.
Well who do you watch a lot?
Hmmm.. I love watching William Perry.
I don't think I've heard of him before.
Maybe you know him by his nickname. The Refrigerator.
Yeah! I've heard of the refrigerator before.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The preseason is coming up already!
Yeah, might watch a game or two on my big TV.
I heard about that! I'll have to come over for the opener.
San Francisco, I think.
They are beatable! They can't even make up their minds about the quarterback.
You mean they don't still have Capernick?
They shuffled him off over that whole prayer thing.
No, it was the Anthem.
Right. Anyway, the year is looking good.
No doubt. 11-5 for sure.
These are those good times.
I'm a little worried about the playoffs.
Let's just enjoy the regular season for now. Really, man!
If they keep them out of the backfield, everything will be alright.
Yeah, maybe 32 sacks last year.
They should have drafted some O-line.
Those guys are hard to get.
Dallas has no trouble getting them!
Forget Dallas, what about that AFC Championship game last year?
Kind of a massacre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, with these NFL rule changes and protections, I think it's time to see more of the run-option in playbooks.
I've heard announcers talk about that and, I hate to profess my ignorance, but what is the run-option? Isn't it just the QB sneak?
No, the run-option is all about creating a traditional handoff play, but the QB decides after the hike to actually hand off or run.
Ok, and that's different how?
The sneak is a designed play like the draw or scramble because the play is designed to go either way defending on the action taken.
Why? How does the QB choose?
Well, the QB reads the outside rush and, if they bite on the run and move to stop the RB, he keeps it, if they move to sack him then he hands it off.
It sounds like every play should be the option, I have no idea how to defend against it.
Well, it rests on discipline of the defensive team. Rex Ryan wrote the book on defending the option.
Ryan, is he the Bills Coach?
Yeah, and before that he was the Jets coach, great defensive mind.
How did he defend against it?
Usually, you don't commit the rush until the handoff is complete or not. If the defender is patient, they can stuff it for a loss every play.
So why did Tebow beat him on that awesome Jets game?
Well, with most rushes, you only have to guard against the outside run, a QB normally doesn't run up the middle
Because they can't churn up yards there I'm guessing
That, and you can take more hits, less chance to slide.
That make sense, so Tebow was able to beat it because the threat was in all directions and that's just tough to defend.
Ryan almost won that game, they did shut down that offense pretty solidly with his awesome coverage and safeties
It was pretty raucaus and a good defensive match.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, I would never count out Brady.
Yea, didn't they sign a top flight CB this year too.
Yea, I forget his name, but I think they signed the best one on the market.
I don't know how they do it, but they just find ways to keep winning.
Yea, they have been one franchise that has consistently won.
Yea, they sure have the recipe for success.
Yea, them a green bay to a lesser extent seem to have found the winning formula.
Yea, well the key is that you have to build through the draft.
I agree. Ask the redskins how it goes when you don't.
Yea, they would tell you a whole story. They have enough experience.
Yea, some of these general managers need to realize that you cannot build through free agency.
I agree. That is for patching specific needs.
The draft is where you need to build your team.
I agree and when some teams start to realize that, they may see more success.
Well, this one is directed right at you Washington.
Yea, I do not know what they are doing.
Me either, but Cleveland better start taking advantage of their picks because they have a lot of them.
Yea, maybe its finally the time to start turning it around.
That or they will re-draft Brady Quinn or something.
Yea, they haven't been the best in the draft.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do,you think there will be any surprises in the NFL this year?
There is usually a couple of teams who surprise us.
Yes. Some teams catch some breaks.
I've seen a few crazy predictions.
What have you seen?
I've seen Tennessee predicted to win 13 games.
That's a bit of a stretch.
I've seen someone having the saints winning 14 games.
Wow,that's a bold prediction.
Some think the Cowboys will win 12 games.
I don't agree with that.
I don't either.
How about Houston and the chiefs winning 13 games.
Wow,I'm not agreeing with that.
Crazy things happen in the NFL.
Every year brings surprises.
I've even seen the bengals are picked to win 12 games.
Even the eagles are picked by some to win 11 games.
That's a tough NFC east.
It's like the old days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Andy Dalton will lead the Cincinnati Bengals to the Superbowl this season!
No way! He's failed the past years how can you say that now?
This is going to be his year! I can feel it, with AJ Green healthy, the running game strong and the defense as strong as ever they're going to do it this year!
I highly doubt it. I think they'll have a good season like they always do but fall short again in the playoffs.
I look at their team this year and I look at the other teams in the AFC and I don't see a threat in their division.
You only feel that way because Le'Veon Bell hasn't signed back with the Steelers.
I think the Steelers are getting old. Big Ben can't last a season without getting hurt and so this season I feel the Bengals have their best shot.
I think they'll be the same. I still think the Steelers are the team to beat in their division and I see them on the same levels as the Baltimore Ravens.
I think they're way better than the Ravens. The Ravens haven't really improved.
I think the Ravens are well coached John Harbaugh is a very good coach and he gets the most out of his players.
I won't disagree with you there but the talent level isn't there for the Ravens.
Let's assume the Bengals win the division, they'll have to face the Patriots, Raiders, or Chiefs in the playoffs. That isn't any easy task.
I think they're on the levels as those teams and I think you'll see Marvin Lewis really coach them to that next level this season.
They're going to win 9 games at the most.
You're underrating them! I think they're going to be an 11 win team at the least.
I'll let you have that but I don't think they're going to win that many games.
Who do you think is going to come out of the AFC or at least challenge the Patriots?
I think the Raiders have a good shot but I also really like the Steelers once Le'Veon signs his contract.
I'm sticking with my Bengals as the top team to come out!
You're a true fan if your belief is that strong, I'll commend you on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
I always am.
Did you hear about the Colts general manager.
Well kind of.
The colts fired him and replaced him.
What team did he end up going to?
He ended up going to the Cleveland Browns
Hopefully he does better there.
Yeah I agree. Maybe he was just not a good fit for the colts.
Who replaced him?
He was replaced by Chris Ballard.
Did they take alot of interviews.
I think he was fired and Chris Ballard took his place in a week or a little after that.
Wow that was fast.
Ryan Grigson did not get hired as the general manager for the Browns though.
Oh really what did he get hired to do?
He was hired by the Cleveland Browns as a Senior Personnel Executive.
Oh wow that is different than I thought.
Maybe it will be better for him.
I hope so because the Colts did not go anywhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the greatest athletes to ever play in the NFL?
That's a tough question!
I know. But, some guys really stand out.
Like who?
Jim Thorpe was a pioneer for the league. And, many people consider him the greatest athlete ever.
True, but I think modern athletes would out perform him easily.
Who do you have in mind, then?
Bo Jackson is often mentioned.
I agree. Athletes that played multiple professional sports are truly special.
Do you know any others?
Athletes that played professionally in multiple sports?
Yes. I can think of only Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders.
Danny Ainge played baseball and basketball professionaly.
Wow, I didn't know that. Any others?
George Halas played pro baseball and pro football.
True, he was also one of the founders of the NFL.
That's impressive!
Paddy Driscoll had a similar career. He is also considered the best drop kicker in the history of the NFL.
Are drop kicks still allowed in the NFL?
Yes, Doug Flutie scored on one in 2006.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man you ready for some football?
Oh yeah. Go packers!!
I didn't know you were a packers fan.
Oh yeah. I guess I got it from my dad.
Oh cool. I like Payton manning. I don't care what team he's on.
So your a Broncos fan right now?
Sure am. He's a great quarterback. I Was so happy when he left the colts.
Yeah I never was a colts fan.
I'm not a Patriots fan.
Well yeah but I think Tom Brady's pretty good.
You do? What about deflating the footballs and cheating by looking at plays?
Well I'm not so sure all that happened.
Which one?
Both of them.
Well they got fined for the deflating balls. I think they did for looking at the play books.
I just don't belive someone like Brady would cheat that way.
Well how do you explain how they win so much?
They are just a really solid team.
I'm not so sure.
Look at the last Super Bowl. They came back against the Falcons. They couldn't have cheated then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the opening game of the NFL season this year?
Well, they always open with the Super Bowl winner at home, so it is Patriots and Chiefs.
Don't the Pats play the Falcons this year?
Yes, later in the season at home.
Well that was a missed opportunity! They should've opened with rematch.
I think the NFL may have done that a few years ago and the coaches didn't like it.
I'm sure ratings would've been through the roof though.
Probably. At least it wasn't the Bills or the Jets.
Yeah, for being an in-division "rival" they aren't really rivals.
Not at all. The Patriots kind of run the AFC East.
I wonder if they'd be as successful in another division?
Overall, yes, but I think if they were in a division with the Broncos that would be their one major challenge.
Why is that?
That is literally the only team against which Brady has a losing record?
Are you serious?
Yes. He's tied against Arizona, Green Bay, Giants, and Seattle, but only losing against Denver.
That is really impressive.
It is. He has a winning percentage in the high 70s. For someone who has played well over 200 games, that is amazing.
How many wins does he have?
He has 208. The most ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tom Brady got one more in him.
Even though we dont have Marshawn they are still strong offensive
But now they don't have any running game
Someone will pick up his spot
We might be getting old but we have experience.
But with youth  you get the hunger
But you might do something foolish to lose the game
And we have the speed to correct
Well is there any other team that might make it to the big show
North Carolinian panther might have a shot.
Ya they did look good but will they learn from there mistakes
I think they will
How about the cowboys
They had a good run but failed with injures
Well if everyone is healthy I think they might have a shot.
That is true but I like the seahawks
Well I think a repeat with the patriots
There too old
Well the seahawks got no running game
Ya but we got youth
XXXXXXXXXXX
you a giants fan
nope
why not
im a falcons fan
good reason
plus i grew up in the north and hate all jersey and philly teams
giants are the NY giants
nope
yup
technically. they play in jersey
so why are they the NY giants
i dont know. let me call the commissioner and ask
haha good one
yeah i got jokes
you know what you dont have
what
a super bowl win. burn
good one
i know. i got jokes
you do
XXXXXXXXXXX
You watched the Dolphins and the Ravens last night?
No, was it a bad game?
Yes, the Ravens utterly destroyed the Dolphins.
What was the score?
The Ravens scored 38 points but the Dolphins could only get 6 points.
Wow, that's worse than I thought it would be.
Yes, I almost fell asleep right before halftime.
What did Tannehill do for the Dolphins?
He did okay. He had 226 passing yards.
What did Flacco do for the Ravens?
Flacco had a very good game. He had 381 passing yards and he threw 4 touchdowns.
What did Miami's rushing look like?
They had 62 rushing yards as a team.
Who was the leading rusher for Miami?
Jay Ajayi had 61 rushing yards.
Wait a minute. That means he pretty much had all of his team's rushes.
Yes, believe it or not.
How many yards did the Ravens get in rushing?
They didn't rush too much so they only got 110 rushing yards.
Okay. Next week, I'll make sure I watch the Ravens next game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how are the falcons gonna do this year?
Hopefully go back to the super bowl
do you think they can?
No reason not too.
Why
Added some pieces they needed plus the offense will be as good.
Is ryan gonna be an mvp again
probably not but that super bowl loss wasn't his fault.
Who's was it
Everyone's
They need to make the rb's happy.
yup
Wasn't freeman whining this offseason?
He sure was
Why?
Becasue he thinks he should be making more money
Should he?
Nope
Why not
He makes enough
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are less than 60 days until NFL season, are you excited?
Yes, for sure.. Been a long summer.
Who is your favorite team?
Dallas Cowboys, always!
Do you think Dak will have another great year?
He will only get better. He still has the OL to protect
Dallas has pretty good RB & WR's
Dez, Cole, and Terrance will be healthy & Zeke is a beast
Any chance you give them for the Superbowl?
Don't think Superbowl is in cards, but playoffs for sure
Who do you like in the AFC?
Anyone but Pittsburgh!!
What do you have against the Steelers?
Dont like Ben and the players think they are so good
I like the Patriots and Brady!
I dont like their coach, but have respect for what he has done
You have any sleeper teams this year?
I think the Rams will be an interesting team to watch
Why do you say that?
Goff is a better QB and they added some strong players
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about NFL salaries compared to NBA salaries?
Both are raking in cash but the NFL players are definitely getting the short end of the stick.
Why do you say that?
Because there is no way James Harden should be making more money than any of the top 5 NFL quarterbacks.
I agree it's kind of silly James Harden makes more money than Tom Brady.
Exactly or Aaron Rodgers.
But the NBA doesn't have to pay as many players so they can afford to pay more.
That would be a good argument if both leagues made the same amount of revenue but that's not the case.
You think the NFL makes more revenue than the NBA?
They make close to four times more than the NBA.
Okay, that makes things a little different.
So when I hear people bring up the more players argument it's laughable.
You're right, the NFL players have a legitimate argument to make.
Of course they do but NFL players don't have as much power as NBA players.
Well I guess you can blame the NFLPA for that.
They are largely responsible but players share some of the blame as well.
If the NFL is making that much more money than the NBA, they should definitely be paying players more.
Maybe things will even out when they renegotiate the next collective bargaining agreement.
I hope so, the NFL owners can't complain about revenue if they are making that much money.
The definitely can't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi!  NFL football is about to begin again, I can't wait.
Me either! Who's your favorite team?
I love the Falcons.
Even after last years Super Bowl?
Yep, this is Matt Ryan's year!
Well I'm sticking with the Patriots.
You would! I like the Lions too.
Why? They aren't that good.
Yes, but I like Matt Stafford.
Oh yeah, he was UGA's quarterback.
Yep! Are you going to any games?
I hope so, I want to tailgate.
Me too!
I got tickets to the new Atlanta Mercedes Benz stadium.
Cool! I want to go with you!
Ok, you can come when they play the Saints
Wow, that will be a crazy game!
I know, they are the Falcons biggest rivals.
I can't wait for NFL football!
Only a couple more months!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Almost football time!
You know it!
We've got to catch some games this year.
Will the little woman let you out of the house?
Well, Sunday for sure. You know we play pool on Mondays.
That bites. Do they have it on the big screen down there?
Usually. Sometimes they slip up.
I can't imagine missing the Monday night games.
i usually DVR it in case it is a great game. If it is lame, I haven't missed anything.
Can you stay up that late? You have that day job.
Well, it's only sixteen times a year.
That Pittsburg game was fantastic.
You know, Roethlisberger is real good.
He was that week; like 400 yards.
I'd hate to be a running back on that team!
He's good too; he was a college star at MSU.
I think they won 5 Super bowls maybe.
Six maybe; you're talking about Roger Stauback too.
No, that was Terry Bradshaw. He's on Fox Sports now.
Well, he was good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Cowboys.
I like the Steelers.
Haha.  They were big rivals in the 70s.
Yeah.  They have meant in 3 Super Bowls.
Yeah.  Steelers won two and the Cowboys won it in the late 90s.
It seems your defense is getting in trouble off the field lately with 4 arrests.
Yeah, we keep beating ourselves.
Do you think Romo will come back?
No, I think he is done now that he is in the CBS booth.
Yeah I think so too.  If Zak gets hurt, then they are screwed.
Yeah, same with Rothlesburger.
Yeah hopefully he can stay healthy this year.
Bell always seems to get beat up too.
Our defense does too.  Harrison had to come out of retirement to play.
He could out bench the rest of the team when he retired!
He is now 39 years old and still playing!
That is more impressive than Brady being 40 and still playing!
It is, because he gets hit on every play as a defensive lineman.
Yeah, and he is effective too, because I always see him rushing the passer from the outside.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the NFL?
Of course! I watch every Sunday in the fall.
Who is the team you follow?
I don't really have a particular team, I just like the game. How about you?
I'm a Patriots fan through and through.
Must be real difficult to like a winning team.
Well, they've been my favorite since before they started this new era. Drew Bledsoe was still the quarterback.
Ok, fair enough. So last year's Super Bowl must have been awesome for you.
Well, not at first. I was a little depressed when the score was 28-3.
I can imagine. But it was the Falcons' fans depressed at the end.
That's for sure. I really have never seen anything like it.
It seemed like a combination of the Patriots being really good and the Falcons just melting down.
That and an unwillingess to change the game plan.
What do you mean?
Well, the Falcons were always an offense with a lot of passing, but they didn't need to do that at the end of the game.
Oh that's right. Because they were almost in field goal range.
Right. So if they would've just run a few times, they probably would've won.
Not that you are complaining though.
Of course not. I got to celebrate.
And so did the Pats!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How exited are you for the nfl season to start.
I cant wait
I hope the Stelers do well this year.
I agree i love teasing my husband about how great they are compared to the Saints.
I do that i remind everyone how Big Ben is a awsome quarter back while Drew Brees is a baby.
My husband gets so mad about it every year.
Mine wagers a bet with me that the Saints will go further then the Steelers.
Well hes been losong a lot then.
He was so disappointed last year when the Steelers went to the playoffs.
I hoped you rubbed it in that the Saints didnt even make it to the play offs
I did he had to pay up and take me ot to dinner and a movie.
i need to start that with my hubby.
Hey i heard that Ben Rothensberger had lost several fingers in a fourth of July fireworks accident.
I read that online but it was a false story.
Oh i had been so worried he has had so many problems in the past.
I know but that story was a fake there was no official statement and it was later stated that it was a false story.
I think we should see if we can make a game this year
It would be nice to go back to Pittsburgh i could show you where i lived before i come down here.
We could make a weekend of it.
Il  will see if they have the schdule and ticket prices up yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Raiders?
I'm so pumped they're moving soon!
Yeah, but I think that's still a few years away.
Two if I remember correctly.
Aren't they building a brand new stadium?
Yep, it's going to be off the strip I think.
Right, just off the big freeway that runs through Vegas.
I just think it's cool that we'll have a sports team within a two hour drive from here.
If anything, it will be good to see fans be able to travel to their games in a more affordable fashion.
Yep, so glad the owners approved their move.
Funny thing is Oakland deserves better.  They were pretty good last year.
Yeah, Carr may have been the most improved player in the league.
Him getting hurt was a killer for them.
Their offense totally dropped off with him out.
They didn't do jack in the playoffs because of it.
Which is disappointing as they could have competed with the Patriots
I love Mack on their defense.  Just a force off the edge.
He's probably a top five edge rusher in my opinion.
Top five?  Gotta be higher than that.
He might be top two or three, but there's tons of quality at that position.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is Indianapolis Colts coach?
Chuck Pagano
Is he good?
He has led them toalot of wins.
Andrew Luck is the quarterback
I like him
Robert Mathis retired.
oh wow! He will be missed.
reggie wayne also retired
he was a big value to the team also.
I agree Him and Robert Mathis helped that team alot
yes they did
I realy like TY Hilton
he is one of the best in the league
I agree. He is already breaking records.
He and Andrew have broken records.
I think Peyton Manning should of stayed
I do to
He should work for them
He is off doing other things right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When can kids sign up for football?
I think when they are about 8 years old.
Today kids are starting younger and younger.
I know that kids are starting soccer at 4 years old.
Wow, I wonder if bodies can handle football at such young ages.
Well, a big topic is concussions.
I wonder how many football players have had concussions?
I don't know.  Good question.
Do their helmets protect them?
I don't know, but it seems like they still get concussion despite having helmets.
Some hits are really hard.
Football is a dangerous sport.
I guess all sports and activities can be dangerous.
Yeah, you get good physical exercise from football.
I just don't know if it is worth the risk.
I don't want my boys to play football.
It is dangerous.
I hope that my boys pick a different sport.
Me too.  I just can't take the stress of watching the rough sport.
If only they had better protection from injury it would be fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Panthers?
They are okay
Do you think they will get back to the finals?
Possibly
Do you like Newton?
He does not have a good attitude
I agree. He seems arrogant
he did not do good in the Super Bowl
He did terribly
I think he needs to become more mature
He will be. That always happens
Do you like their defense?
Yes
Do you like their offense?
Yes, they have a good team, but the question is can they beat the best?
I think they can
In a tough NFC, it can be overwhelming
Yeah the teams are not getting worse
That is true. There are many good teams
I personally like the Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football to start. It's the Bills year this year!
I hate to burst your bubble but I don't think so.
They have a new head coach and a solid draft class.
Yeah I know but it takes more than that to win the Super Bowl.
I know but they are moving in the right direction.
True, I still think it will take a few years though.
I agree, I just try to stay optimistic.
Nothing wrong with that! I thought they would draft Chad Kelly.
I thought that too! Glad they didn't though.
How come? He's a great raw talent.
Raw talent, yes, but he's got a lot to work on off the field.
Yeah I hear you there. I think he'll do well fighting for a starting position.
It will probably take a few years before he makes his first start but he will be good.
Yeah I don't hate the guy, I want him to do great!
I think everyone from Buffalo is pulling for him because of his uncle Jim.
Jim Kelly is the best thing to ever happen to that city!
Four straight Super Bowls, I'd say so.
Only team to ever do that in history. I can't believe they couldn't win just one.
It's a touchy subject to talk about in Buffalo.
I know, it's just such a crazy stat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football!!!!!
Yeah the season can't get here soon enough.
I hear ya, I wish my Detroit Lions had a chance but you know how they are.
That's a rough one man, they always suck.
Yup I know, once in my lifetime it would be cool to see them win it all, but I'm not holding my breath.
Well my Packers are looking good this year, we got a shot.
Yeah their pretty good every year, I don't know how those fans sit outside in that frozen tundra.
It's tough, but we love it! Who do you think will win it all this year?
It's hard not to say the Patriots, they are like a machine and I think Brady and Belichick want one more before they retire.
Yeah I hear ya, but I don't think they repeat. I think Seattle or Green Bay win it all this year.
Being a Michigan man, I would like to see Brady get one more and retire
The Cowboys might also make some noise this year, They looked good last year, and this year should be better.
Yeah Romo was pissed when Prescott took over, but he is a better QB.
Ezekiel Elliott is a real good back also. They are pretty solid overall.
You doing any fantasy this year?
I'm on Fanduel, so good to go.
Alright side bet with my Lions and your Packers. Case of beer for whoever wins our head to heads, no points.
You're on, get ready to send me some of that good Founder's beer buddy
Lol. yeah good luck.
Go pack!!!!!

Hi there.
Hello.
You like the NFL?
Yeah sure do.  You?
Yep.
Do you play fantasy football?
Yeah I love it.
Same here.
It's pretty addicting isn't it?
Yeah absolutely.  I get a little obsessed.
I have to limit myself to just being in two leagues?
Only two?
Yep, how many are you in?
I'm in 4 and sometimes 5.
Man that must get confusing.
How do you mean?
Like which team to go for or which player?
Oh yeah.  That is a problem sometimes.
Well good luck this season.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so excited for the Cowboys this season!
Me too! They are going to be so good.
Dak Prescott had such a good rookie season last year he may only be able to go backwards.
I doubt it. He looked so confident on the field I don't see him moving backwards this season.
I really hope you are right. The Cowboys offense is so good they just need a half decent quarterback to score.
No doubt. All Dak Prescott has to do is not be bad and they should be able to win.
How do you think Ezekiel Elliot will do this year?
Well he had over 1000 rushing yards last year so it may be hard to beat but he ended the season strong.
He was amazing. He should have gotten the MVP last year.
I have to disagree about the MVP but he was insane for a rookie running back.
Ok but this year if he puts up similar numbers there is no way he does not get it.
I have to agree there. If he puts up the same or better numbers this upcoming season he deserves to be MVP.
I think the offense can carry the Cowboys to the Superbowl this year.
I don't know about the Superbowl. I would just be happy if they made it to the conference championship.
For sure. Last season's loss to Green Bay was gut wrenching.
It was but that game was probably the best playoff game out of them all.
That game was so great. The Cowboys looked like they were out at the begining but fought back to almost take it.
They came really close. I was on the edge of my seat to the last minute of that game.
Aaron Rodgers played lights out. I don't think any team could have beat him that game.
You are probably right. Without his extreme performance Green Bay does not win that game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the better quarterback Joe Montana or Steve Young?
There is no such thing as a wrong answer here. But you have to go by different years.
Why do you have to go by different years, just who is overall?
Because you have say, Steve Young 1993 vs. Joe Montana 1988.
Steve Young I know ended his career with a better overall passer rating I think.
True 23 more rushing touchdowns too.
Don't forget though that Young also played on great 49ers teams, ones that Montana help build.
Very true, Montana helped build those
Montana is who you wanted if your team was down 7 points, at the 2 minute warning to tie the game.
So you say hands down Montana?
I'm thinking Montana is a god and Steve Young is top ten?
Montana proved how great he was when John Elway scored with like 40 seconds left to take the lead against the chiefs.
Yeah and then Montana drove those sorry butts down field and scored to win the game.
Young learned a lot from him and took the team to the superbowl in 94.
I think I'm super old school so Montana might be my final pick too.
I've grown to respect young more and more over the years though probably after he retired.
Too bad he didn't get consistent playing time til he was in his 30's and past his prime.
True, who knows what he could have been now.
So I guess Montana everyday and twice on Sunday.
I agree, respect for Joe but Montana for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some NFL football?
I love both college and NFL. Football season is my favorite time of the year.
Which Florida team will have the best record this year?
I think it will be Tampa Bay. They have a strong offense.
The Jacksonville Jaguars are stacked with running backs though.
I know they just drafted Leonard Fournette.
They still have Chris Ivory and T.J. Yeldon too.
They will be able to run the ball no question.
Tampa Bay has running backs amd receivers though.
Winston is a good quarterback. He will continue to develop.
I can't wait to draft Mike Evans in fantasy this year. That guy always puts up points.
He is a top 3 receiver. You better grab him quick.
The Miami Dolphins will strugglr again this season.
It seems like every year they have a glimpse of hope and then fade off again.
The state of Florida has 3 NFL teams and they can't even get one to make the playoffs.
Tampa Bay may have a chance this year.
I hope so. I watch all their games.
They have tough rivals in the Saints and Falcons.
The Falcons choked big time in the Superbowl.
At least they made it to the Superbowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you an NFL fan?
I am. I would say I almost study the game.
That's great to hear. I'm the exact same way.
It's a great sport. I look forward to the season starting every year.
Me too. Who do you think the best running backs will be in the coming season?
Well, you have to look at the guys who made the top 100 players. Ezekiel Elliot is probably number one.
I can agree with that. I don't think their rankings are exactly accurate, though.
True. It does depend a lot on the amount of support the player gets from his team.
Definitely. A running back isn't going to get anywhere without good openings.
Yeah, and that's something that has to be dealt with on the offensive line.
True. I feel like offensive linemen are overlooked.
I agree. They play a very important role.
Just because they're not fast doesn't mean their role isn't as big as, say, a wide receiver.
Exactly. What other running backs do you think will be good this year?
I think Le'Veon Bell is going to do well for the Steelers.
He's definitely up there in terms of running backs.
I also think David Johnson is going to be very impressive this year.
Is that the running back on the Cardinals?
Yeah, you don't hear much about them. He's really good, though.
He does have some impressive stats.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you know who owns the Steelers franchise.
Yes the Rooney family ownes the Steelers.
Do you know how long
I do believe Art Rooney purchased the Steelers franchise in 1933
So from 1933 til now 2017
Yes thats correct for about 85 years now.
Wow thats amazing i didnt realize they had even been around since the 30s
I grew up in Washington Pa only a 1/2 hour from Pittsburgh so i have grown up loving them
So what are the offical colors of the Steelers.
Theyre colors are Black and Gold.
But they have white in their uniforms.
They do but officially the team colors are black and gold.
How many wins do the Pittsburgh Steelers have. I always heard that the Oakland Raiders have the most
That is so not true the Raiders have 410 While the steelers have 529 since their first game
who was their first game against?  do you kow>
Yes in 1933 they played the New York Giants
who won
Sadly the Giants won i think the score was 23-2
Wow are you going to any games this year?
I want to it depends on theyre schdule and mine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So i see Houston has to face New England in the third game of the pre-season.
Yes, i'm not looking forward to seeing that game.
Why not?
Well, New england crushed it last season, i don't see why they wouldnt do it again this year.
Hopefully that dynasty will get crushed.
Yes, i'd like to see the Texans take a stab at it.
They got some good draft picks this year, ya never know.
True. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
What day is the Texans / New England?
The 24th. They have to face The Jags and the Bengals first.
Jacksonville will be no problem. They have low stats for years now.
True. They got a couple of good draft pics as well, maybe they could up their stats.
I wouldnt hold my breathe.
I hear ya. Now the Bengals my be a bit of a challenge.
Yeah, but they too didnt do well last year either.
Better than Jacksonville.
Most teams did! LOL!
Anyway, My fingers will be crossed for Houston.
Yeah, we'll see. I think Denver has a shot.
Eww, really? Denver?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the deepest position in NFL football?
Deepest as in has the most talent?
Yes - which position has the most talent?
Well I would say that punter has a lot of talent.
I am talking skill positions.
Well I would say tight end - it seems like a lot of teams have good ones.
I somewhat agree.
It seems like tight end usage comes down to implementation.
The Patriots have always used tight ends well.
That might just be Brady doing his thing.
You make a good point - they have amazing offensive schemes, though.
So yeah, it definitely comes down to utilization and scheme type.
But I would also say that running back seems pretty solid now.
There are fewer feature backs, and more specialty backs - but a lot of them.
You are right - there are a ton of solid running backs.
With that said, the higher end talent seems more scarce.
It seems that the playing field is more even, though.
I wonder if these trends will continue this season.
As long as passing is so highly touted, then I think so.
Yes, I agree. We will see what happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Only a few weeks until NFL training camp. I can't wait.
Will you be attending some days?
Probably not, since it is so hot outside. I'll just catch all the news and observations online.
I might head out to see how the newer players we got perform. I'm really excited about Brandin Cooks.
Oh yea, me too. That dude looks super fast.
I'm hoping it'll be like the Brady to Moss from 2007.
With his other receivers, Brady might take back the touchdown season record from Manning.
That would be really really sweet.
I think he has a good chance with all the weapons he has: Gronk, Edelman, Mitchell, Hogan, Amendola, Allen
Yea, there's just too many. You left out James White!
Our offense is going to be really fun to watch. Do you still have season tickets?
Yea. Let me know which games you want to go to and I'll hook you up.
Are you serious? I'd love to go to the home opener to watch them raise the banner
Consider it done!
Thanks so much. Gillette Stadium will be rocking that night.
How many touchdowns do you think Brady will throw?
I'm going with four.
They're going to destroy the Chiefs. They lost Jamaal Charles too.
Can't believe he's a Bronco
I hate that team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Superbowl this past February?
Yes I did.
What were the teams that participated in this Superbowl?
They were the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons.
Who won this Superbowl?
The New England Patriots in an exciting fashion and a come from behind victory.
Who do you think was the star of this particular Superbowl?
It was by far Tom Brady.
Tom Brady is by far the best quarterback in the NFL.
No doubt about that. He is getting better and better each year.
I believe this past year he was outstanding.
Yes he was.
How many games was he suspended for?
I believe it was for 4 games.
Are you looking forward for this season of football?
Oh! Absolutely.
Who do you think will make it to the Superbowl this year?
I think the New England Patriots will make it to the Superbowl.
How many Superbowls have the New England Patriots won?
They have won 5 Superbowls and I think this will be number 6.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's tough to be a football fan in the bay area.
Why? Didn't the 49ers do okay last year?
Yeah. But I mean, it's more because there are two teams out here.
The Raiders and the 49ers.
Right. And I feel like all of my friends are fans of one but not the other.
But they play in different conferences? I feel like this shouldn't be a problem.
It's not a huge problem or anything, but it's difficult to get people excited.
What do you mean?
It's like they have a rivalry but never play.
Hmm. I understand that, I think. I really do
It's just a little bit uncomfortable. Not a whole lot though.
Well, maybe we should find a weekend when they both play at different times, and have a big party.
I could get into that.
Do you know who to invite?
Kevin is really excited about the new season for the Raiders.
Then he should come.
And Molly and her dad both really like the 49ers.
They should come too!
Okay. This should be fun!
I think it will be!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What a crazy off-season its been in the AFC East!
I know! As usual the patriots got stronger and the Jets didn't.
The patriots did have some great signings and trades, but you can't deny that Tom Brady is getting old.
Sure, he's over 40 but he had one of his best season's last year.
But no quarterback has ever done this well at his age, he's due for regression.
I still disagree - he's got the best coach in the game that knows how to call plays to ensure he's not getting hit.
I was impressed with them getting Brandin Cooks - great trade!
He's going to be amazing with Brady - finally the weapon that Brady needs.
I think Dwayne allen will do well in this offense too
Yeah, that seems like a underappreciated trade.
What about the Jets - do you think they'll improve on last year?
No way! They are a mess - and they don't have a starting caliber quarterback.
You don't think Petty or Heckenberg can have a decent season? I think the defense will be strong.
No - neither of them is an NFL starting quarterback. They drafted well though - they're going to have two great safeties in Adams and Maye.
Yeah - they're going to be great in a few years, the issue is the jets got weaker at Cornerback
Agreed - they should have signed someone reliable other than Claiborne - he's good but injured too often.
But if Claiborne has a good season - the secondary will be a strength of the team.
Don't forget the defensive line - thats the real strength.
Thats true - but Mo Wilkerson needs to have a bounce back season.
I'm sure he will - and Leonard Williams is a beast who will only get better!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL team do you think has the best defense in the league?
After last season, it's really hard to choose between the Patriots, Broncos, and Vikings
If the Vikings had kept going on their path, they could have swept the league
They had such a strong start, I wonder what happened to them?
I don't know, but they say defense wins championships, and they didn't even make the playoffs
Well the Patriots defense was ranked much higher than the Falcons defense, so I suppose that makes sense
I think the Texans had the best defense statistically, even though they played only average
It really depends on the strength of a team's schedule, otherwise the numbers don't mean a whole lot
The Broncos did well enough considering they lost Peyton Manning
He shouldn't have been that much of a factor since the defense carrie the team all the way to the Superbowl
Then what about the Seahawks defense? Better than the Broncos defense or not?
I think they're better as a whole, but both teams are lopsided on offense and defense that it doesn't matter
Balance is definitely a huge factor in the league, which is why the Falcons lack of a strong defense cost them so dearly
I don't think their defense was that bad, but then they did give up almost 30 points late in the game
So consistency is more important, since a lot of games are won and lost in the final minutes
I definitely like to see a game played at its fullest to the final whistle
Andew Luck is a great quarterback who has a knack for making late game-winning comebacks
So is Matthew Stafford, although you wouldn't know it by the Lions' record the last few seasons
Remember when they made the playoffs only to lose to the Cowboys in the first game?
That was one of the most disappointing games I've watched, and I hope Matthew Stafford takes the team all the way next season
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you excited for this year's fantasy football season?
Yeah man. I can't get enough fantasy football!
Who would you take number 1 overall this year?
Standard or PPR scoring?
Standard. I'm old school.
Haha, I'm not giving away any secrets man!
Well, if he's your number one overall, there really isn't a way I can steal him from you! Plus there's only like 4 people it can actually be.
Hmmmm. Okay I'll tell you. I really like Le'Veon Bell. He's been a beast and won me the championship last year!
Yeah he's great. So explosive and a true bellcow. Bellcows dont even exist anymore which makes him so much more valuable.
Plus he's in a great offense... and the Steelers' lackluster defense kinda helps them by getting into high scoring games.
Yeah you can't go wrong with Bell, but I'm going to go with David Johnson if I get the chance.
David Johnson. Oh whoa whoa whoa. Yeah he's great and doesn't have the injury history that Bell has I guess.
Yeah, and nothing against Bell, but Johnson also just seems like an awesome dude. Like I could hang out with him and fit in.
Haha, well he might have some humble beginnings coming from Northern Iowa.
Hmm yeah youre right. So it sounds like we are both feeling RBs early this year and not WRs or QBs?
Well its not smart to take QBs early ever. There's so much value to be found in the later rounds.
But WRs? I think last year the first 3 or 4 picks were often WRs.
Yeah but I think last year peole almost undervalued RBs too much and now we're returning to the mean.
Perhaps, but I don't think we're back in the 2001-2008 days where RBs were king!
Ha no way. We're a long ways from the days of Priest Holmes, Jamaal Lewis, Clinton Portis, and Ahman Green!
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you think will win the superbowl this year
It's hard not to think the Pats are going to be there again
I guess but they didnt win in as much as the Falcons lost last year
I think you can argue that point which is couldnt they have just given up
Yes of course and I guess thats what makes them so good but again the Falcons threw the win away
Ok so thats one team do you think the Falcons are going back?
No way.
Why not?
I am not sure they were that good last year and Matty Ice had a great season
Thats true but they have a phenominal offensive array of weapons.
But what about their defense do you think they are good enough to help them get back?
Yes and no but truth is who has that great lockdown defense in the NFL now anyway?
Personally I like the Steelers I think they have all the ingredients they need to win
What about the Packers?
Great QB but not much else and even he couldnt get them to win a home game against the Giants
Oh now that you mention it the Giants! Yes they are pretty good
I dont like their running game and they are totally inconsistent but your right they are right there
They have a good not great defense
True. But what about their offense
Well they did rather well in this draft by plugging holes they had I think they have the best shot out of the NFC.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXVI.
Who played in that one?
Buffalo against Washington.
Where was it played?
The Metrodome in Minneapolis.
I know Kelly was the Bills' QB.  How about the Redskins?
Mark Rypien.
What was the halftime score?
17-0, Redskins.
Who did the halftime show?
They had some Olympics folks, plus Gloria Estefan.
How did the third quarter go?
The Bills got 14 but Washington scored 14.
What happened in the fourth quarter?
Buffalo did score 14 points but the Redskins scored 6, making the final 37-24.
Who was the MVP?
Mark Rypien.
Who were the broadcasters?
Pat Summerall and John Madden.
I felt bad for Buffalo losing all those Superbowls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when Tyler Lockett got his leg crushed during that touchdown catch last season?
Oh god, yes. You could feel it thru the TV set.
His leg got munched and he was like a foot from the goal line.
Wilson got abused too trying to make that TD.
Yes, it was sad thet it was only a 3 pointer after all that abuse.
Oh yeah, and from Arizona to boot.
I think that was the turn around for Arizona.
You think?
Yeah. They when from "Meh" to "Hey, these guys are getting good!"
Thinking about it i think you are right.
Arizona's stats are strong for this season.
We'll see.
Is Marcus Mariotta's ankle healed yet?
Probably, i'll have to look it up.
Go check, i'll wait.
Ok, says he healed and will be playing.
Right on, i like him.
I think i would have liked him more if Tampa had picked him up.
You are still better about that?
Not so much now as Winston is playing better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, do you play fantasy football by any chance?
Yes, I've been playing for many years and I have two teams.
So do I!  Football season is like 20 weeks of Christmas for me.
Same here. I live for the NFL and the NY Giants.
I will always be a Niners fan and the Jets are my favorite N.Y. team.  I will usually root for the Giants in their division.
I'm starting to put together my top fantasy picks. Which running backs do you like?
I'm trying to get Ezekial Elliott this year. That dude is going to go off.
He great but I don't like drafting anyone from the Cowboys.
I totally understand that feeling.  I'm no fan of the Dolphins.
Well at least you don't have to worry about the conflict of drafting a Dolphin this year.
Ha ha, that's true.  It's been years since I've paid any attention to their roster.
Speaking of Florida, there is some good talent on the Bucs this year.
I had Jameis Winston as a back up last year.  When he was hot he could rack up some points.
I agree, and with another year in the NFL under his belt he should do even better this year.
I like Cam Newton but he doesn't have enough quality receivers.  the Panthers need some studs.
Yeah, that's been a problem with him since his rookie year. We still haven't been able to see what he is really capable of.
Who do you like in the QB position?
I still believe in Aaron Rodgers. He's one of those guys who still puts up points even when he doesn't put up a win.
I like watching Drew Brees but I'm afraid to draft him anymore.
Truth. He is no spring chicken anymore, a big hit could take him out for the season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!
What's your favorite team?
Dolphins
Miami?
Yea, man!
Why them?  They're terrible!
I lived in Florida most of my life
Oh I see
What's your favorite team?
Oh I'm a Steelers fan!
Okay.  Why them?
Why not?
Oh, that's fine.  I just thought you might have a reason
No, not really
Okay then
Hey, I gotta run!
Okay man!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Quarterback situation in Houston?
The Texans?     After Brock Osweiler, anything would be better.
Yes, but that guy is gone.     What about the others.
They keep saying Tom Savage will start.
Is that a good thing?
I think we need to see how Deshaun Watson does in preseason.
He was incredible in college last year.
That is true, but the NCAA is not the NFL.
Don't they have another quarterback too?
Yes, Brandon Weedon is still on the roster.
What team did he come from?
Well, the last team he was with was the Dallas Cowboys.
Right.     They didn't draft him though, did they?
No, I believe the Cleveland Browns originally drafted Weedon.
Well, that's three, guys.    Will talent win out?
Watson is definitely the most talented, but sometimes it takes time.
I just hope they give him an opportunity.
Yes, let him learn.    I hope he takes over sometime during the season.
Well, if Tom Savage wins the job and makes it through the year, it can't be too bad.
I guess so, that means Watson can learn, and the team is doing good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the most underrated head coach in the NFL?
As far as current coaches go, I think Marvin Lewis deserves credit for taking the Bengals to the playoffs several years running
Yeah but they haven't won a playoff game in something like two decades
That may be, but plenty of teams people consider better than the Bengals consistently miss the playoffs
John Fox led the Broncos to the playoffs several times only to get fired a few years back
That's true, and I sometimes wonder if the Bengals will do the same thing to Marvin Lewis some day
It worked for the Broncos when they brought in Gary Kubiak, so you may be right
I still think Marvin Lewis is a good coach and would land on his feet somewhere else if that happened
Absolutely, since Kubiak coached an unsuccessful Houston Texans a couple of years before going to the Broncos
Can we really attribute their success to the coach, or is it more the players?
That's hard to tell, and I think you can really only give credit to clearly exemplary coaches like Bill Belichick
Belichick will probably go down as the best coach in NFL history, so it's hard to make comparisons
Who else do you think deserves recognition as a head coach?
Bruce Arians' Cardinals have been struggling the last couple of years, but they came awfully close to their goal a couple seasons back
Arians won coach of the year recently, too, didn't he?
Yes he did, and for someone who was virtually run out of Pittsburgh I'd say that's quite the accomplishment
But does that offer him job security moving forward?
It will for a while, but if the Cardinals don't make it to the Superbowl in the next couple of seasons, he may end up on the chopping block
I guess that doesn't bode well for Marvin Lewis if his Bengals can't even win a playoff game
Probably not, but the NFL community works in mysterious ways, so I guess we'll see
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the new rule changes
I think they're dumb but who knows how everything will play out
I feel like Roger Goodell is just changing stuff because he wants to, and he's not actually changing anything of substance
Yeah the overtime rule change was pointless
Who is your favorite team?
Cleveland
Ouch, Im sorry to hear that
Hah, Its ok Im a loyal fan
How do you feel about the season?
Im happy about the draft, Im somewhat optimistic, but we have a tough division.
Yeah I hear you, I have the Steelers winning that division pretty easily
I can see why
I feel like whoever wins is just being setup to lose to New England
Its so crazy how they always just seem to get better
Yeah Bill does a great job moving on at the right time
I dont understand how they get so many good players for so cheap
Winning environment, people will take a discount to win titles
Yeah I guess so
You think they'll win again?
Yeah probably
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, NFL season is just around the corner. What are you most excited for?
I can't wait to fill out my fantasy draft and root on my team!
Which team do you support? I'm a fan of the Carolina Panthers.
I like the Panthers! They were close to winning the superbowl a couple years back. I prefer the Los Angeles Rams.
Rams are cool too! Though they haven't been doing well as of late. What do you think of their recent move?
I'm a fan because my parents grew up supporting the LA Rams. Do you think it'll be good for the team?
In the long run, yes. Right now, no. Once this new stadium works out it'll be exciting.
I agree! Do you think the Rams will have a shot at making the playoffs this year?
There's always a chance. I think it's unlikely given their division, but certainly within the realm of possibility. What do you think about the Panthers?
You're the Panthers fan, but I think they're a good team. They have a growingly hard division though and may have to get a wild card spot.
Speaking of the playoffs, what did you think of last year's superbowl game?
I thought it was so exciting! I could not believe it came down to the last play. What did you think?
I thought it was great. I like to root for the underdog but it was still exciting to see the Patriots come back.
Yes, I too liked the comeback. I actually predicted in the middle of it they would come back. Do you think the Patriots will be good again this year?
Yes, I do. I think they are a perennially good team. Who else do you think is a good team always?
I think the Packers and Broncos are continually good teams. Your Panthers could get up there in a few years!
It'll be a while, but yes I think that's plausible. Are you excited for your fantasy draft?
Yes, I can't wait to pick members from my Rams and other teams.
Cool! Hope you're excited for the season.
I totally am and wish you the best!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the preseason?
I usually am after such a long break.
It's a good chance to see the rookies play for sure.
I think that for a lot of teams it's a really important tool to figure out your team.
It seems every year a player or two has a great preseason and gets a starting job.
Watching rookie quarterbacks is my favorite part.
I want to see how Trubisky does with the Bears.
They gave up so much to get him he's going to have a lot of pressure on him.
And the fans of the bears weren't a fan of the move either.
He's going to have to have a hot start to win the fans over.
He was pretty good in college I think he will be fine.
I think he'll be fine too just needs a little time.
They have Howard now to give him some relief in the running game.
If he picks up the playbook he could be worth the trade.
Yeah I agree if they found a franchise QB any price is worth it.
There's only so many great QBs out there got to do whatever it takes to get them.
Look how long the Browns have been trying.
It's been forever since they had a good quarter back.
They missed on Weeden and a bunch of others.
Johnny Football was a pretty big bust too.

It is almost football season!
I know! I love drinking and watching games on the weekend.
What network do you like watching the best?
I prefer Fox. They have better graphics over CBS.
NBC is my least favorite but they have the late games so I don't watch much anyways.
Do you play Fantasy football?
I am in a couple leagues at work.
I am having trouble deciding on who I should draft for my QB.
You have to get a strong QB like Tom Brady or Drew Brees.
Good suggestion but those guys are getting old.
You can gurantee they will get a few touchdowns each game.
Brady looks better tham ever.
True but Drew Brees is hanging in there with him. Each year the media tries to count him out.
It helps when you have great receivers. I thought it was interesting the Saints picked up Ted Ginn Jr.
That guy is really fast but can't catch a ball.
He has the worst butter fingers.
Hopefully he will just be a distraction for the other Saints receivers to make the plays.
I didn't think about it like that. Good point.
Didn't the Saints trade away Brandin Cooks.
I think you are right. Not sure where he ended up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always wanted to go to a Superbowl game.
What, like sit the crowd and watch in real time?
Exactly, I feel like it would be a great experience.
Yeah, but loud and crazy.
I like loud and crazy! I wonder how people get the tickets.
They are crazy expensive, I don't know how people afford them either.
When I have money, I'm going to a Superbowl.
Well I hope that comes true for you.
Well what about you, have you ever been to a Superbowl?
Not personally, but my brother has.
Really, which one?
I don't remember the teams, but I do remember it was in 2003.
That's so long ago!
Yeah, I was a little kid at the time so I didn't go, but he talks about it all the time.
How did he get the tickets?
He won a radio contest with his friend.
Oh, nice!
Yeah, one of those "be the 8th caller" things.
Those contests are real?
Yeah, apparently!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you do a Fantasy Football draft like this every year?
Yeah, or at least the last few. It's fun.
Hmm. I'm no good at these sorts of things.
Why not?
I'm just not knowledgable about football.
You could study!
Maybe. Last year I had one of my students help me pick.
Did that go well?
Awful.
Well, that's too bad.
It was still fun though.
I could give you some advice?
Okay. What've you got
Well, first, if you want to study, you should look at the statistics.
Any specific ones?
Just go team by team. Maybe start with the ones that made the playoffs.
Okay. That makes sense.
Yeah, just look at who was good last year and guess.
I guess I can do that. An NFL fantasy draft doesn't have to be intimidating!
It really doesn't!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey the NFL preseason is coming up!
Yeah, when is the Hall of Fame Game?
Thursday August 3rd.
Who is playing in it?
Cardinals and Cowboys.
The should be a good one. Who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Chicago Bears even if they are terrible. You?
My favorite team is the Detroit Lions so I understand what you mean.
I think you guys have a chance of making the playoffs again this year.
Yeah, but we never win. At least you guys have a Superbowl win.
Yeah but it was over 30 years ago. No recent success.
That's better than no success at all!
True, who do you think will win it all this year?
I think the Falcons win in a redemption story.
Really? I don't know if they'll make it again. The NFC is always competitive.
Yeah, but I think they'll be motivated from last year.
I think the Patriots could repeat, or maybe the Packers if they get a better defense.
I can't stand the Packers and I bet you can't either.
Nope, that's something we can both agree on.
Yeah, they always win the division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready to be quizzed?
Yes
Tampa Bay?
Bucaneers
Oakland?
Raiders
Tennesee?
Oilers
No. They are the Titans
I thought they were the Oilers
No
They used to be the Oilers
Really
Yes
I did not know that
They changed it in the lat 90's I think
Cool
Are they your favorite team?
I like them a lot
Cool. I like them too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the NFL this year?
It's hard to get excited, with the Bears basically in a rebuild.
Yeah, nothing is more underwhelming than Mike Glennon. Not bad, but not thrilling.
Right. Hopefully Trubisky shows up earlier than expected.
I don't feel great about that pick. The history of Bears QBs and all that.
Gotta hope. At least we get a new GM if he flops.
Yeah, but Pace will have at least another couple years.
I'm not looking forward to another transition, though.
Agreed. Flip flopping from a 4-3 to a 3-4 takes enough time.
I feel bad for the other side of the ball, too.
Jordan Howard emerges, but it's on a team going nowhere.
Right, and who knows which receivers will be healthy by week three.
But then Kevin White is almost like a rookie again, so there's hope.
A rookie with no good ankles. I'm not optimistic.
What do you think about the real rookies, other than Trubisky?
It's awfully small-school heavy.
You mean the TE, Shaheen?
I was thinking about that tiny 3rd-down back they took later.
You don't like Tarik Cohen?
If he turns into the next Devin Hester, fine, but there aren't too many of those.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's the most wonderful time of the year.
Christmas?
No, silly! Football season!
Oh yeah, right. Not quite but soon.
Not that far off. Season begins September 7th with the preseason kick off on August 3rd, less than a month away!
Oh wow, that can't believe how fast this year has gone by. Who is starting us off?
Hall of Fame game of Dallas Cowboys versus Arizona Cardinals on NBC.
That is going to be an intense game. Even if I wasn't a major Cowboys fan I wouldn't want to miss it.
Been keeping up with their players lately?
Been keeping up with their cheerleaders mostly, but did hear a couple players had some issues this past week.
Oh? What's up?
Well linebacker Damien Wilson was arrested for suspicion of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Then running back Darren McFadden family was injured in that Little Rock shooting.
Oh no, that's horrible! What happened?
I don't know all the details, but I'll update you if I hear more soon.
Appreciate it. Thanks man.
No problem. Any other good pregames to look forward to?
August 25th Kansas City Chiefs at Seattle Seahawks should be promising.
Ooo. That will be a good one. What's Denver look like?
They're earlier on. August 10th I think at Chicago Bears.
Bears don't stand a chance in Hell, but I'll be in the area that week so I may check it out anyways.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think the 49ers will do to get their franchise quarterback?
I think they will stick it out with hotter and reassess next off season
Any names you think will be in the conversation?
The obvious one is Kirk cousins because of his past with Kyle shanahan
Who else? Any college abs?
Sam darnold from USC is widely considered the best qb prospect for next years draft. And their will always be a couple new names that you will hear about come April.
Back to cousins, is that a real possibility in your opinion?
Absolutely. If he had it his way he would have been here back in march but the redskins are making things very difficult.
How so?
For starters they keep using the franchise tag on him not allowing him to find a new team. And if that's not bad enough they can't agree to a new deal and refuse to trade him. It's a mess.
I've also heard that Dan Snyder won't trade him to sf out of spite of the shannahans when they coached there.
I know I heard the same thing and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he was that petty. Either pay him or let him walk or trade him!
My thoughts exactly. What are your expectations for Hoyer?
Not much honestly, but he did win like 7 games with the browns..THE BROWNS..of all teams so who knows. I think he can win us 4-5 games.
I think cj beatherd is gonna make some noise in training camp and win the job.
No way. Hoyer knows the offense very well and was brought here for that reason he's the starter week 1 and his job to lose. If he gets injured  that's when you see beatherd
Given his injury history it's almost guaranteed we see beatherd then!
It give you that. O line needs to step up keep Hoyer on his feet or we're done.
One name to watch for?
RUEBEN FOSTER! He's a beast and will be D.R.O.Y. I can't believe we got him at the end of round 1. By the end of the season you will see a lot of foster jerseys around Levi's guaranteed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So i was reading that Jamis Winston could break some touvhdown ecords this season.
Really? What did the article say?
Well, he's thrown 50 already in his 3 year career so far.
Wow, i didnt know that
Yeah, so now to beat Josh Freeman's franchise mark of 80 he only needs 31.
31?
Yes, basically 2 touchdowns per game and 1 in playoffs.
Well, that's easier said than done.
I know, he's only 23 too.
Really? just 23?
Yeah, amazing, eh?
No kidding, he's really running up the numbers playing for Tampa.
Keep in mind this is a franchise record, he would need to rack up 136 to beat Can Newton.
Ah, i see.
Also he's working on beating a passing record as well.
Really?
Yes, this could really be a season for Jamis
It would bew heartbreaking for him to break these records and not make the playoffs.
I know, this happened last season, there were a lot of numbers surpassed by the bucs but meant nothing because they didnt get to the playoffs.
I remember. That was sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you still a big football fan?
Yes! I am counting down the days until the NFL returns.
I am actually looking forward to it myself this year.
I did not think you cared for the NFL that much?
I used to not care for it at all, until I moved to Nashville. Now I actually look forward to going to watch the Titans play.
Cool, now we can talk a lot more during the season!
We sure can! I am really excited about Marcus Mariota.
I do not blame you, he is a really good young player.
If you could start a franchise with any player in the league right now, who would it be?
To be honest, it might be Dak prescott if I had to pick one guy.
Really? You would take him over guys like Arron Rodgers,Andrew Luck, or even a great receiver like Antonio Brown?
I would for a couple of reasons actually. The first being his uncanny composure when he is on the field.
You can just tell he never panics. I will give you that one.
The other reason is because he can control the game with both his arms and his legs.
He does have great mobility. However so does Luck and Rodgers as well.
Yea, but he is so much younger than them; so that is why I would pick him if I were starting a new franchise.
You actually make some pretty good points about Prescott.
I have always enjoyed watching him, even when he was at Mississippi State.
I do not think anybody thought he could come in and steal Tony Romo's job though!
I hate that Romo lost his job, but I am really happy for Prescott.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Andrew Luck will be prepared for the upcoming season.
I hope so.
His shoulder surgery was just recently.
I hope all the players are ready.
I hope the teams with new quarterbacks are prepared.
Yeah that is scary for the teams.
It is good though.
Yeah everyone deserves to play.
I think the NFL should make them aware that do not let hurt people play.
They do have rules like that.
Not everyone follows them.
I agree with that.
I am ready for football to start already.
Me too. It will soon.
I cannot wait to watch the Colts make it to the superbowl.
The patriots will beat them.
iI think some teams may surprise you.
I think the Cowboys are coming for it.
They have alot of fresh players and they are good.
They are strong too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the NFL season begin?
It starts the first week of September.
Who do you think will have a good season this year?
I am hoping that the Panthers come out strong this season.
How do you think the patriots will perform this season?
Patriots are okay, they will make it to playoff's but not the Superbowl.
What are your thoughts about the Atlanta Falcons?
They are a good team, they may make it to playoff's but definitely not the Superbowl.
Is the Superbowl game in Atlanta this season?
Atlanta will host the Superbowl in 2019.
So, where is the Superbowl being played in 2018
I think it will be in Minnesota?
Which NFL team has the most Superbowl wins of all time?
The Pittsburgh Steelers has won 6 Superbowl titles.
Who is your favorite NFL team.
I love the Washington Redskins.
Do the Redskins have a chance this year of making the playoff's
Maybe. If they can keep Kirk Cousins they may stand a chance of getting to the playoffs.
Do you think The Patriots Quarter back Tom Brady should retire?
Well, the way he performed last year is a great indicator that he should not retire.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL games a lot?
Sort of, whenever I have the time, really.
Well aren't they always on Sunday?
Yeah, but there's usually several games at once.
True, I just pick the one I am most interested in to watch.
Yeah, sometimes I do try and watch multiple games at the same time though.
How do you manage that?
I just flip the channels back and forth or look on the internet.
Seems like a lot of work.
It is, but I just love so many teams.
Which teams do you like?
I like the Steelers, I like the Packers....
The Packers? Oh boy....
Hey, they aren't that bad.
Not bad, just not my cup of tea.
I also like the Patriots.
Oh god, another one that's not my cup of tea.
And what's wrong with them?
I just think they are wayyyy overhyped.
I don't think so, but agree to disagree!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the worst NFL team?
Haha, that's a loaded question.
That's understandable, it's based on the season, right?
Yeah. Like the Raiders was horrible one season, and then they got Carr and just look at them now.
Yep. But I think the Browns have been very bad.
Haha, yeah, they can't pick out a proper QB.
What ever happened to RG3 and everyone else.
Yeah, both of their defense and offense are just horrible.
Yeah didn't they have an all lost season the year before that?
Nope they won one game to not have the worst season ever.
Have anyone ever gone 0-16?
Yeah the Lions in 2008.
Oh yeah! But they turn around now.
Yeah, they've been playing much better. Though, I still can't forget that game where Aaron Rodgers throw that Hail Mary and beat them.
Yep, that was heart-broken.
Anyway, who do you think is the worst team?
I would have to go the Browns or the Jacs.
Oh yeah, leave it to Florida to have 3 teams and still suck.
Haha quality over quantity, am I right?
Yes sir.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One major thing we have in common is our love for the NFL. Would you agree?
Oh absolutely. I love football in general, but of course the NFL is where it's at.
Refresh me, if you would. Who is your team?
I am from Cleveland, so of course, I love my Browns.
Ah, hey, I respect that. I am a Denver fan.
The Broncos are a great team. I am sure you were a very happy guy last year?
Oh, absolutely. I was at the edge of my seat for that entire game.
It was just such a great way for Manning to go out, also.
That's what I thought. Do you think he would've gone another year if they hadn't won?
It is quite possible. He was very determined to get that last ring.
I also really respect that he retired quietly.
That was really respectable of him. Payton did not want to take anything away from the team.
He sure didn't. He is simply an pro.
Do you think he could go on to be a commentator?
I wouldn't rule that out, no. I could see him perhaps on Sports Center.
If he were to do it, I don't think it would be anytime soon.
No? Why do you say that?
Because I think he would want to enjoy retirement for the time being.
Good point. That being said, he was such an awesome quarterback.
Definitely. I think he will go down as one the greatest!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe some of the weird names that NFL players have?
Yeah, what's up with Forest Lamp?
That sounds like a decoration, not a person, and I think it's odd that someone named Lamp went to the Chargers
There was a player named Taco who went to the Dallas Cowboys in the draft, too
A guy named Taco in a place where Tex-Mex was born seems like a pretty good fit
I can understand some names that sound ethnic, like Ndamukong, but Taco is strange
I think Solomon Thomas has a pretty cool first name that commands respect
Yeah, it sounds kind of biblical in a way, and for a big guy like that to command respect is definitely a plus
The 49ers defense needs to win back people's respect, and they probably couldn't do that with a bunch of players named Taco and Budda
Then again, Budda Baker is supposed to be a pretty talented athlete
I suppose it's easier to forgive weird names when the people sporting them are enormously talented
I just wish people would stop naming their kids Deshaun and Lesean so I don't get so confused when they end up on the same team
At least if they're on the Eagles like McCoy and Jackson, they'll end up traded away before long
Yeah, what is it with the Eagles and trading their best players away?
Maybe they're building up their roster for the future and compiling draft picks like the Browns
I think the Browns lucked out with all those draft picks and still ended up with Myles Garrett and Jabrill Peppers
Do you think Peppers is as overrated as people say?
No, I think people just say that because he plays at several different positions so there's less information to go off of
This could be the eve of the Browns' rise to greatness after years of being the punchline to everyone's jokes
Sure, but they're going to need to pick up some more strangely-named players first
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team in the NFL has the best defense right now?
I think the Houston Texans have the best defense going into the upcoming season.
You think they're better than the Patriots, Broncos, and Seahawks?
I think they are better. They don't get as much publicity because they're not a flashy team but I think they're defense is really, really good.
The Patriots defense allowed the lowest points though, and they get stops to win games when it counts!
I mean the Broncos, Patriots and Seahawks defenses give up less points than the Texans but the Texans allow the fewest yards. It just means teams can't move the ball against them.
That's true and a good point a lot of times last season the opposing teams scored on them or put up points because of the Texans inept offense.
Right, their offense was terrible. They turned the ball over a lot and couldn't move the ball so the defense was put in a lot of tough situations.
Okay, I can see that. I like how they improved the offense this year.
They made substantial changes because it's definitely necessary. I think they're going to be back to the playoffs and they'll take their division again too.
Yeah it doesn't look like the AFC South has much competition for them. I don't see the Jacksonville Jaguars or the Colts making enough noise.
There just isn't enough talent on those other teams to challenge the Houston Texans right now. I'm not saying the Texans are the best team overall in the AFC but in their division their clearly better than those other teams.
I can see them winning their division again but do you think they'll go further in the playoffs this year?
I don't see the Texans challenging the superior teams in the AFC like the Patriots, Steelers, Raiders and Chiefs, but you never know.
It seems like every new season we have a lot of surprising teams rise and some good teams fall.
This might be the season the Texans begin to rise up to the ranks of the superior teams we'll talk about in the future.
I'm still not sold on their offense but I'm willing to see what they have in store for the season.
As long as JJ Watts returns healthy they're defense is going to look even better than last year.
I can't wait to see JJ return to the field. He's such an unstoppable pass rusher.
You can feel the fear in quarterbacks when he's lined across from them. I hope he makes a good and healthy return too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo, we gonna have the same NFL deal this year?
OK with me.
Same side bet?
I'm good for it.
OK I got Detroit, you got Green Bay
Agreed.
I think Detroit will get to the playoffs
You goy no shot dude.
As long as Stafford stays healthy we're a shoe in.Detroit will do it's usual , fade at the end.
Same goes for Green Bay. It's all on the QB
Rodgers os a sissy
Rodgers is the best and you know it.
Wanna up the bet?
OK double.
I don't know if I should be betting $2.00 on a NFL game.....
Are yoiu a fan or not?
Only a problem if you loose.
You got a problem
If my wife finds out I'll never watch NFL again
Ditto
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is there a worse divison in the NFL than the AFC South?
I don't know, that'd be hard to beat.
The Texans somehow went 9-7 to win the division last year, but they were awful.
Yeah, and the Titans were even worse, but somehow they also went 9-7.
The Colts might be better, but they haven't given Andrew Luck any help at all and should be lucky to finish .500 this year.
And the Jaguars are the Jaguars - that is to say, bad.
No doubt. Whoever wins this division figures to be a first-round playoff elimination.
Yeah. Same could be said of whoever wins the NFC West.
True. The Seahawks win every year, but their 10-5-1 record was inflated last year by playing three lousy teams twice each.
Yeah, the Cardinals are OK, I guess, but the Rams and 49ers just are putrid.
Yep. Neither team should match its win total from last season, and they were two of the NFL's worst teams last year.
The Niners won two games - and they could be WORSE this season if that's possible.
Very true. Who the heck will play quarterback?
I don't know, but they let Colin Kaepernick go so it doesn't look good.
Can't see any Super Bowl contenders coming from either division.
I think you're right. These division winners will get little more than participation trophies.
The AFC South is a bunch of middling teams beating up on each other.
Yep, and the NFC West is one slightly above average team feasting on a bunch of bad teams.
I suppose it gives each team something of a shot, though, unlike the AFC East.
Yeah, but none of those teams is going anywhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't wait for the NFL season.
How do you think the Lions will do?
Same old Lions. All hype.
I just hope Stafford doesn't do like Barry and Calvin
Oh God, don't say that.
I don't see them making the playoffs this year.
We can hope.
Green Bay is still the team to beat I think.
Minnesota is better too.
Chicago should still suck.
Detroit has a brutal schedule.
Too bad they can't schedule Utah St.
They don't want any of that.
You ain't right.
Neither is Jim Caldwell
I like Jim.
He's a likeable guy, but not the answer.
Who is?
I don't ,know
How about Wayne Fontes again?
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the NFL begin?
You could argue 1920.
Argue? Why do you have to argue?
Well, they started in 1920. But, the league was called the American Professional Football Conference -- the APFC.
I see. When did they become the NFL?
That change happened in 1922.
Are any of those teams still around?
Yes, there are two of the founding teams still in existence.
Which two?
Only the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals remain.
They had a team in Arizona in 1922?
No, actually, both those teams started in Chicago.
What were their names in 1922?
The Chicago Bears were called the Decatur Staleys.
And, the Cardinals?
They were called the Chicago Cardinals.
That makes sense.
Yes, it is interesting how teams change over the years.
Give me an example.
The Browns started in 1945. But, they were originally in All-America Football Conference -- the AAFC.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Dallas Cowboys can make it to the Superbowl this season?
I think they have a very good chance if Dez Bryant can stay healthy along with Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott.
That's such a solid core they have right there. I was so impressed by both Ezekiel and Dak's rookie season showing.
They both exceeded expectations that's why the Cowboys were so good last season.
I know they were so mature for their age.
At the start of last season I thought the Cowboys were done for after Tony Romo got hurt.
It did look pretty bleak, but Dak came in and looked like a seasoned veteran!
I think their coach Jason Garrett did a fine job in easing him into the quarterback role.
They didn't put a lot of pressure on him so he had time to settle into the role, I agree.
Having Ezekiel play so well helped out a lot! Don't forget that.
Sometimes I still wonder if Ezekiel is that good, or if the Dallas Cowboy's offensive line is just that dominating.
I think it's a combination of both.
That's true you can't be an effective running back with a poor offensive line but you also need a running back with good vision, speed, and strength to make your offensive line look good too.
You also need a down field threat and a competent quarterback. Dallas had all those ingredients that's why their season last year was so successful.
I'm excited to see them this year with that season of experience under their belts.
I think we're going to see a resurrection soon of the great Jimmy Johnson Cowboys of the past in the form of the current team.
I can see that. Ezekiel would be Emmitt Smith reborn, Dez Bryant as Michael Irvin, Dak as the new Troy Aikman.
What's amazing is Jason Witten would still be Jason Witten!
That's not right. Jason Witten came into the league drafted by the Cowboys in 2003! That's after great Cowboys era!
Oh yeah, you're right I forgot about that. It just seems like Jason Witten has been around forever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Doesn't it just suck that the Steelers aren't any good anymore?
They made it to the AFC championship game, how are they not good anymore?
Well, we don't win super bowls anymore! WE need to change our defense up to compete with Brady.
You Steelers fans are spoiled. You still have the most super bowls and go to tons of AFC championship games.
This is true, but I am tired of running the same defense against Tom Brady for 15 years and losing.
Yes, I do remember in 2001 when you lost the AFC champ game to a young Tom Brady and he kicked off his stellar career.
The Steelers are always right there man. In the 1990s we had a shot to stop the cowboys and their dynasty in the 96 superbowl.
Yes, you also had a shot to stop John Elway and Denver in the late 1990s.
We are 6-2 in super bowls and unfortunately, the Patriots have passed the Steelers with most super bowl appearances.
I think that your record is safe, I don't see the patriots doing much more now. In fact, they wouldn't even be under consideration if it wasn't for Pete Carrol's dumb call in the super bowl that let them win.
That was an excellent super bowl. He would  have been a hero if the pass had worked though!
I disagree. This was one of the worst calls I have ever seen in football.
I don't disagree, but if the pass was completed for a touchdown, no one would of been talking about it at all.
I would have run the football every single time on that play. I would have run it twice.
SO what can the Steelers do to get back to being the best NFL team?
Well, I still think the Steelers are one of the top teams. They need to work on their defense when they play Tom Brady. You can't zone blitz against that guy.
I know, how frustrating. He always finds the blitzing man and picks us apart. For some reason, through 2 defensive coordinators we have never changed that in 15 plus years.
I tell you what, I think when Brady leaves the patriots, they will fall off. However, I think the Steelers will always be there, like they have been since the 70s.
Well yes, I agree. However, we would have to ignore the 1980s for that to be true. We were terrible in the 1980s.
True, but at the end of the day, we still have the model franchise of the NFL, in my opinion. We have won with three different coaches over the years. The patriots have not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dad, can I stay up and watch the game with you?
Son, Sunday night football is on until late. You have school tomorrow.
You have work tomorrow.
I know, but I am an adult.
I know, but I love watching the game with you.
I love that too, but I want you to get your rest.
I can sleep anytime, but I can't always watch a great great with my dad.
True, I don't want your mother to be angry at me.
She doesn't have to know.
She is on her girls retreat until Tuesday.
See, please dad.
Okay, you can stay up.
Thank you.
It will be fun.
I know.
Go get me a beer.
Ok. I got you me one too.
I don't think so.
No one has to know.
Give it to me kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the colts make the playoffs?
Yes I do.
An espn writer has then winning the SUPERBOWL.
I don't see that happening.
I don't either.
The writer is Dan Graziano.
Who does he have them beating?
The Minnesota Vikings.
Wow,no kidding.
That's a bit of a stretch.
Quite a bit I think.
Isn't the SUPERBOWL in Minnesota?
Yes it is.
That would be the first home team to ever play in the SUPERBOWL.
Yes it would.
I don't think either goes to the Super Bowl.
I agree.
I do like the colts making the playoffs.
I do too.
I think Andrew luck has a good season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thing about the NFL?
I think it's how anyone can be good in any year.
Who do you think will be good this year?
Probably the Patriots again but there are some sleepers.
Which teams are a good sleeper pick?
Well I like the Panthers and Saints to make some noise in the NFC.
How do you think Brees and Newton will look this year?
Newton should have a better year. I think Brees puts up a lot of points again.
I'm excited about the new LA teams.
yeah the rams and chargers both in LA.  that is crazy.
It's like the old days I guess.
I wonder if either of them will be any good.
Well the Rams always play good defense.  The Chargers play good offense.
if only they could combine into a superteam.
They will probably wouldn't be able to beat the Patriots.
What about the Packers this year?
I think they will be tough too, and they always seem to score points.
Any good defenses to watch?
I think the Bills defense will surprise some people.
I'm excited to find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man who is the best quarterback to play in the NFL
Oh that's easy, Joe Montana. No question!
Dude where have you been? Tom Brady is way better than him!
Well, he has more Superbowl wins, but is he really better?
Yeah, with winning Superbowl 51 he has the most Superbowl wins....it is the Superbowl!
Yeah, the most wins don't make you the best. He deflated his balls so....
Dude that's not cheating, he just thought of it!
Yeah, but how can you beat 40,551 career passing yards? Joe Montana is the man!
Yeah that is impressive but I still think Brady is the best.
Well, if it's not all about Superbowls, you have to count John Elway. He had 51,000 total passing yards.
Really? That many? I don't think he won any Superbowls, did he?
No, he won 2.
Hmmmm...but Brady has been in the league as a quarterback. Longer than anyone.
You have Brady bro crush!
Of course, he's a role model and has a model a model for a wife.
Yeah but there are so many other great quarterbacks. What about Dan Marino? Brett Favre? Peyton Manning?
Yeah Brett Favre was pretty good. Wasn't he the quarterback for the Packers when they were good?
Yeah, he dominated. 71,838 total yards.....even though he only had one Superbowl.
Dang! He was a beast!
Yeah, he was really good. He just didn't make to the Superbowl. The Superbowl is not the end all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about them Steelers?!
I love the Steelers, but they are going to have to wait until Tom Brady retires to win again.
Yeah, the Patriots have our number for sure.
I'm unsure about the Falcons this season. I think they had their one shot and blew it.
Maybe! That loss in the Super Bowl last year probably stings.
Yeah. Do you think they'll make it to the Super Bowl again?
I'm not sure. The NFC has so many good teams.
Totally. It's definitely the stronger division.
AFC is good, too. Watch out for the Raiders this season.
Definitely. They got robbed last year.
I still don't see them making it past the Patriots or Steelers in the playoffs.
We'll never know. Hopefully they can redeem themselves this season.
I see Colin Kaepernick still hasn't been signed.
This country wants to talk about rights and freedom but blackballs a guy for exercising his rights.
There are a number of teams I could see him being the starter on.
Yeah, like the team he was already on.
Yeah. I wanted to have high hopes for the Browns this year but I don't think I can.
They had a good draft this year.
Yeah, but it's the Browns.
True indeed. Good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't believe it's football time.
I know, I'm excited.
Who is your team?
I like the Raiders.
Are you upset about them moving to Las Vegas.
No, I love to gamble, so it works out.
Really? But don't you think they will lose their edge?
Nope, I think it's pretty static.
Who is your favorite player?
I love Derek Carr.
Do you think they overpaid him though?
Yes, but he is their first competent QB in forever, so you had to keep him.
You think he'll get even better this year?
Yeah, I like his chances with our new receivers.
Do you think they'll be a playoff team?
Yes, I think we'll win about 11 games this year.
Hmm.. and who are you worried about?
No one really, I think we're capable of beating anyone.
Ok, well good luck.
Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best quarterback?
I like Aaron Rodgers the most.
Really? You don't like Brady?
I like him but Rodgers is more fun to watch.
What do you mean?
He's more athletic and has a stronger arm.
The Patriots have won more than the Packers.
Football has offense and defense and the Patriots are better all around.
The Packers have the better Quarterback.
Did you see his throw in the playoffs?
The throw against the Cardinals?
Yeah, he threw the ball fifty yards.
That was the final play in regulation.
There was so much pressure on that play.
If he messed up the game was over.
The Packers ended up losing anyway.
I know but the throw was so memorable.
Rodgers kept his team alive.
The Packers always have a chance with Rodgers.
The Quarterback is so important in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Rams Vs. 49ers game?
I watched some of it but turned it off at halftime.
I couldn't believe the Rams got shut out like that.
Oh yea, what was the final score?
The Rams lost 28 to 0.
Are you telling me that the Rams couldn't even get a field goal?
Yes, I was shocked by their performance.
I'm glad I didn't watch the second half.
Yes, you didn't miss too much.
How many passing yards did Keenum get?
A lowly 120 yards.
Really? What was his QB rating?
You are not going to believe this but 5.1.
How is that even possible?
Everyone he threw the ball to dropped passes.
Unbelievable, how did Gabbert do for the 49ers?
He had 170 passing yards and a QB rating of 91.
Well, that explains why his team won.
Yep, I think I am not going to watch the Rams next week.
I agree. I may go to sleep early again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite football team.
I love the Patriots
You mean the cheaters
Only losers complain about the other side cheating.
I hate the Patriots they don't play fair
You either love the Patriots or you're a member of the Hate-riots
Yeah what about videogatge huh?
You know if it was baseball and you were scouting the other team you'd go and watch them and take notes
Yeah...so...
Well Bellecheck sent his scouts to watch other teams.
But he cheated when he did it.
No he used modern technology... instead of taking notes he videoed their practice.
That's cheating!
No that's genius
You guys don' play fair
The Patriots don't complain when they loose.
You guys almost never lose
That's why I love them
Where are you from anyway\
New England of course where the winners live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team in the NFL do you like the least?
Take a guess and I'll tell you if you are right.
Is it the Arizona Cardinals?
No that isn't right.
Is it the Los Angeles Chargers?
That isn't right either.
Okay I give up then.
Are you sure just think about it.
Oh wait is it the Baltimore Ravens?
Exactly I just can't stand them.
Why don't you like them?
There is so much domestic violence associated with their team.
Oh I agree but they can't control that.
Actually they can control it but they choose not too.
What do you mean?
They always look the other way, give second chances, and even let the most shady players join their roster.
That is a good point.
They let Ray Lewis keep playing even after his murder trial.
Yeah but he is a solid player.
He definitely is but still the mentality in Baltimore is winning over being moral.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights of Superbowl IV.
I forgot that one.
Kansas City versus Minnesota.
Oh yes, the upset.
Minnesota was favored by twelve points.
Who was the Vikings QB?
The great Joe Kapp.
I remember him with the Boston Patriots.
Yes.  Len Dawson was the KC quarterback.
Who were the coaches?
Bud Grant and Hank Stram.
Who scored first?
KC, with a 48 yard field goal.
Yes, the soccer style kickers were just getting on board.
Jan Stenerud.
Who was leading at halftime.
The Chiefs, 16-0.
What was the final score?
23-7, Kansas City.
The AFL tied the NFL in the first four Superbowls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the season opener?
Of course I saw it. I wasn't going to miss Romo.
Romo kicked off the season Hall of Fame style.
Do you think he'll get in the Hall of Fame this year.
They might make him wait, but he definitely has earned his spot in the Hall of Fame.
Yeah, you're probably right. They made Manning wait too.
That's a good point. I wonder why they wait so long to induct players in the Hall of fame.
They probably wait to they have a more consistent record of wins.
Well they should also get Brees in the Hall of Fame as well.
Oh, Brees has at least 3 seasons before they consider him.
Well, he also has to have some playoff wins as well.
I thought he's already won in the playoffs.
No, Brees only played twice. He has no wins in the playoffs.
Oh that's right. He hit the playoffs his second year.
That's true, but he only missed the playoffs his rookie year by 3 games.
That's true, but teams would kill for his trade.
Apparently they rotate. I'vee seen a new started for 3 games straight.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?
He proably has a season on two left.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think the Patriots will repeat this year?
I don't think so.
They were lucky!
I don't know about that.
They had too many injured players out when they won.
But to come back from that many points, that's amazing.
Right, I don't think we'll see anything close to that again in a Superbowl.
That's for sure.
I'd hate to be on the Falcon's team.
Why do you say that?
Because, to let them come back from that many points down - someone should be fired.
So you saying their going to release some players and rebuild the defense?
Maybe..either that our get rid of some of their coaches.
Coaches, they weren't even on the field
But their suppose to get the players read and they weren't
Obviously!
So who do you think will win this year?
Not sure, Raiders maybe.
Raiders, what!!
They have beast mode!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Superbowl XVII.
Who played in that one?
Miami versus the Washington Redskins.
Wasn't there a strike that year?
Yes, the regular season was only nine games.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Dave Woodley for the Dolphins and Joe Theismann for the Redskins.
Where was it played?
The Rose Bowl.
Who did the halftime show?
The Los Angeles Super Drill Team.
Who scored first?
Miami, 7-0 after one.
What was the halftime score?
17-10, Miami
And the third quarter?
17-13, Miami.
What happened in the rest of the game?
The Redskins scored two touchdowns to win, 27-17.
That was their first SB win, I believe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the panthers will bounce back this year?
I hope not.
You don't like them?
Not a big fan of cam newton.
I'm not either.
Well they open in San Francisco.
That should be a win.
Game two is home against the bills.
That should be another win.
The home for the saints.
Not an easy game.
Then they go to New England.
Oh boy,that's not a win.
Then they have the lions,eagles and bears.
All winnable games.
They could also lose those games.
They also get the falcons twice and green bay at home.
Not an easy schedule.
But they have the jets away.
Another win for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like sport?
Of course I do, Go Bucks!
Eww you like the Bucs?
Born and raise in Florida, got to love them.
I appreciate that, they seem to be doing better.
Yeah there last season was amazing!
I like watching their receiver making big plays.
Well, just Mike tyson for the moment, but I hope they can do better.
I hope so, too. There's one thing I still don't understand though...
What's that?
Why would they ever draft a kicker for their first pick?
Oh my gosh, please never speak of that again.
Haha, I'm just kidding.
It's okay we make a lot of dumb choice.
Like when you would trade that one corner back after paying 96$ million.
I hope they would traded...
OH, they didn't trade, they just release him.
yepp....
It's okay, I think with that new quarterback, I think they can turn it around.
Yes. I hope so to. Go Jameis Winston.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Drew Brees
no, what happened
he broke his leg
WHAT?!
I'm not joking, he feel at his house, and broke his leg
This is going to kill our season!!!!!
It doesn't look good
What did he do?
They say it was a pickup game of basketball
I don't beleve that for a second
There is video, he lands on it wrong, it's brutal
I don't even want to see it
No you don't
This is going to kill my fantasy team.
I forgot, you always pick brees
he is my hold from season to season
Oh man
I know
I'm sorry
This is terrible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who are you most looking forward to seeing play this year?
I think this might be the Cowboys year
Really? It seems like they always figure out how to screw it up.
That is true, but they have all the pieces in place. I wish they would stop blowing draft picks on thug players though.
Yeah, Greg Hardy was a disaster of a pick - and to take him so early could be a disaster. They've gotten through it though before.
They are getting around him with their most recent draft pick too.
Very true. It'll be interesting to see what the Patriots do too.
Yeah, like most Americans, I'm pretty sick of them winning every year. I think it's become a thing to cheer against them.
I certainly do that as well. The lack of interest in watching the same teams win over and over is real.
I am very interested in seeing the new teams and the relocation teams though.
Yeah - I was shocked that the Raiders are actually moving to Vegas and the two teams playing in Los Angeles.
I don't see the two in LA as a feasible thing forever. I don't like that and I'm sure they don't either.
But there are the two teams that play in "New York" - but actually play in New Jersey
That's true, they share a stadium and such, but the Jets aren't good.
That's also true, but the Rams haven't been good for a very long time either. The Chargers aren't good either right now.
The Vegas move shocked me because they have one of the most reputable fan bases in the world.
Yeah, Vegas just got a hockey team too, so I'm not really sure what is so big about Vegas, the city doesn't impress me that much.
I suppose it is good for the Raiders, because they will sell out every game with tourists from elsewhere, but they do abandon one of the most blueblood fan bases and loyal fanbases too!
I guess we'll have to see what happens when it happens.
Very true. Can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about NFL football.
Sounds great to me.
What is your favorite player?
Brian Quick.
Oh he is good.
Yeah. Who is yours?
Robert Quinn.
Interesting.
Yeah.
I like the Patriots a lot too though.
Agreed, they are great.
I watch every Sunday?
You do? That is more than me.
Yeah I make sure I have the time for it.
Anyways did you see the Super Bowl?
Of course I did.
What did you think about it?
It was fantastic.
It was nice talking to you.
Same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How good do you think the jets will be this year?
You mean how bad?
Ok,how bad.
Absolutely terrible.
Don't sugarcoat it.
They have a past his prime Matt forte.
His better years are definitely behind him.
They have no quarterback.
How about josh mccown?
How about he's a journeyman at best.
Who else do they have at qb?
Christian hackenberg and Bryce petty.
Not exactly household names.
They cut their best receiver,Brandon Marshall.
Who their rivals the Giants signed.
Big pickup for them.
Fox sports has the jets winning under 5.5 games.
I think that's safe to say.
I'm not sold on Todd Bowles as head coach.
I'm not either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the NFL draft this year?
Yeah, but only the first couple of nights.
Me too. Who do you think had the best draft?
I think a lot of teams did well, but I think the 49ers scored pretty well.
I think so too, especially after gaining all those picks after barely moving down in the first.
Cleveland seemed to have neverending picks, but who knows what they will do with them?
I think that Myles Garrett was a great pick for Cleveland, but they need a lot more help than just one guy.
That's true, there are too many teams that are more complete than them for it to matter now.
I think Denver is just a few new people away from another Super Bowl.
What Denver really needs is a quarterback, but I don't know who will step up.
I think that they should've traded for someone, but John Elway is all in with the guys he has already.
That could be their downfall, like last year.
They do have Paxton Lynch, who seems very young but promising. I think if anyone can help him, it's Elway.
Oh for sure Elway has a way with quarterbacks since he has so much experience of his own.
I do think he should really step aside and let his coach make some decisions though because he might be getting too emotional.
Yeah, I don't know much about the new coach, but I do know that he has a successful background and should make for an interesting coach in Denver.
With that Denver defense it has to be a coach's dream job. Von Miller is crazy talented.
Von is one of the top talents in the league, but he needs an offense to keep him off the field more.
Denver defense helped them limp through so many games last season.
I can't wait to see their new players start to make an impact!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?
Ben Roethlisberger!
Yes, he is good. But, it's because of the weapons.
Weapons?
Yes, the receivers he has in the backfield.
You mean Antonio Brown?
Yes, he is amazing.
True, but that's not why Ben is so great.
Why is he great, then?
He is dedicated, brave, and bold!
I see. And, those qualities are what it takes to be in the NFL?
Yes, you have to be tough too.
That's true. There are a lot of injuries.
Yes, Ben has had several of them.
Concussions?
Yes, I think so.
Those are scary!
True, but they have excellent medical teams in the NFL.
That's true. I'm glad the players are safe.
Yes, I like to see them on the field and not in the hospital!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm very impressed by Timber Thomas.
The NFL player?
Absolutely.
What'd he do?
I just finished watching the Dragons play.
Right.
He made 3 touchdowns in the game!
That's impressive!
He has one of the best stats in the team.
I didn't know that.
Yes, he had a great season last year too.
Is that when you first noticed him?
Oh yeah.
I hope he keeps it up.
As long as he keeps the injuries away.
Yes, he could get a leg injury from running so much.
So far, he's only pulled muscles.
How do you know?
He said it on his twitter.
Oh ok.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what;'s funny though?
What?
What's the most liberal city in the US?
San Francisco. Go 49ers!
Exactly.49ers didn't have a starting black QB until Troy Smith in 2010.
No way, that's insane. In the city known for its insane liberalism, they didn't even have a black QB until 2010....
That's not even the worst of it.
What do you mean?
The Pariots didn't have any black starting QB until Jacoby brissett in 2016.
Oh and that was for the Brady's suspension.
Yep. Started 2 games, and went inactive again when Brady came back
All these bad storuies don't make me feel good
Well, there are the good ones though
Like who, wait, Cam Newton's pretty good
Russell Wilson, Tyrod Taylor, jaemis Winston, and Dak prescott
Oh, I liek Dak Prescorr, he's gonna be big
Yeah, anyway ther's only one team left who hasn't started a balck QB in their history./
Who?
NY Giants. They srated in 1925, and has never had a black QB start a game.
Well, for whatever it's worth, Eli Manning has the NFL's longest streak in starting. he's never missed a start since 2004.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When you watch the NFL do you think there are too many commercials?
Absolutely.
I think there are too.
I read an article about that recently.
What did it say?
It said in the 2017-2018 season the NFL has cut back on the commercials.
Thank goodness.
The worst was after a score and kickoff.
That was ridiculous.
I know.
Watch one play then back to commercial.
Apparently that is something they will no longer do.
That is good.
It is.
Sounds like Goodell did something right.
He did there.
Too bad he doesn't seem to get anything else right.
No he doesn't.
He is not liked by many people.
I would be one of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So tell me what you think of the Browns this year?
They'll still be at the bottom of the league without a quarterback.
But their defense is going to be a lot better, right?
I would think so based on their new draft picks. They have one of the best defensive ends in Myles Garrett now.
In the NFL, if you have an elite player at defensive end, you can survive in the league.
It's one of the 2-3 most important positions in football.
But they're still so weak at the top position: quarterback.
They really don't have to win this year. All they have to do is improve on last season, and that will give fans hope.
Yes. And then in the next draft they can target a starting quarterback.
That's really all it's about: giving fans hope. Not every team is making the Super Bowl, but giving hope that you can make it in 2-3 years is a good thing.
What other positions did they improve on?
They have a really good safety in Jabrill Peppers. He was taken #25 in the draft.
I think they'll keep games close thanks to their offense, but they still won't be able to score.
If Cody Kessler can stay healthy, and if David Njoku proves he can catch and block, they may be better on offense.
What's your outlook on how many games they can win?
4-5 would be a great achievement, especially if they keep the other games close.
Being competitive in games that you lose can be a good thing. Like you said, it gives fans hope for the next season.
They did also draft a QB in the second round, but he's not ready this year.
And Kessler did look good last year when he was able to stay on the field.
Either way, they still need to get a game changing QB in the 2018 draft to complete their transformation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello, what's your favorite team?
I like the Browns, how about you?
Oh man, I'm a Steelers fan! Do you think the Browns will be any better this year?
I think so, I have a feeling Jabrill Peppers will be real good.
Browns defense is looking better, how about the Steelers offense though?
Leveon Bell is the best RB in the league, do you agree?
I think it is between him and David Johnson.
David Johnson is definitely second best in my opinion. What about best WR?
I would have to say Julio Jones and then Antonio Brown.
Come on man, AB is definitely #1!
As a Browns fan I can't admit that!
Haha too much pride, huh? Who is going to the SB this year?
I think the Patriots and Seahawks!
That would be an awesome rematch, I hate the patriots though!
Have to respect their skill, though. Super talented team.
That is very true, they always knock the Steelers out so I hate them!
Haha well I hate the Steelers so we can call it even!
Maybe the Browns won't lose by 20 to the Steelers this year pal.
Very funny! This is the Browns year!
We will see about that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what team I like as a real darkhorse this year?
Who are you thinking?
Here's a hint: it's in the NFC.
The Cowboys?
No, that's too trendy.  I was thinking of the Bucs.
Ah yes, they made real strides last year.
I like Winston as QB.  Smart, accurate...
He threw some bad picks in some games, but he's young and learning.
It helps when you've got guys to throw to like Mike Evans.
If he could keep his emotions in check, he could be a top five receiver.
I think they added Desean Jackson.
He's lost a few steps, but could be a good slot guy.
They've also got one of my favorite DT's in McCoy.
He's a bit overrated.  Seems like everybody forgets him.
Sure, but he's got some talent.
What do you think of their running back situation?
I love Doug Martin, if he can stay healthy.
That's a big if.  He's taking a real pounding as of late.
If they can just feed him 15 carries a game, he can get through the season.
They just need to pass, pass, pass.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Arizona Cardinals this season?
Maybe, but probably not.
Haha, what do you mean?
Well they have a good team, but they always seem to fail in the playoffs.
Yes that usually happens, but I think David Johnson is a great running back.
Yeah, he's good, and I like him in fantasy football.
Do you like Carson Palmer at quarterback?
No, not particularly.
He's very solid. Why don't you like him?
I think he plays great in the regular season, but he folds in the playoffs.
That has been his weakness.
He's just not a clutch quarterback.
What do you think about their coaching staff?
That's their strength I believe.
I love Bruce Arians as a head coach.
Yes, he really is the mastermind behind that franchise.
The Cardinals were never that good until he got there.
It was a great hire, and I think he is the main reason for their success in recent years.
When I was a kid in the 1990's, that Cardinals franchise was terrible.
I remember that they were always in the basement of their division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay. But what about the other players, tho?
Some new ones are pretty dope.
Uhhh, like who?
Not sure.
Who do you think has the best offense so far?
Definitely the Patriots.
Then the defense?
Broncos, or the Packers.
Mehhh, I'd beg to differ.
How so?
Because there are so many good other players that can do better.
Like who?
One of the tight ends for the Giants. I forgot his name.
Who else?
Another guy who goes with the Ravens?
What about the Bengals?
None there.
And the Browns?
Meh, they're okay.
Wow, you have high standards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the NFL season being so close?
I am very excited about that actually!
What team are you the most excited about?
Well, being from Los Angeles, I am really excited about the Rams!
Are you glad that LA is now a hot spot for pro football once again?
Yes, I am super thrilled to have the NFL back in my hometown!
Do you think the Rams will have a good year this upcoming season?
I hope so! I feel like there is some pretty decent talent to build around for a great future.
What player excites you the most on the current roster?
I would have to go with Todd Gurley. He is an outstanding running back.
He played his college ball at Georgia, right?
Yea, he was great for them just like he has been for us.
How do you feel about the quarterback position?
I think Jared Goff has a lot of potential. Hopefully he is getting the right coaching to go with it.
I remember him playing at California, he ha a super strong arm.
Yea all the physical tools are there for him to be a special NFL quarterback.
Are you going to stick to being a Rams fan? Or will you think about switching to the Chargers, since they are now in LA as well?
No, I am a Rams fan for life.
No love for La's newest team huh?
I will support them when I can, but I love the Rams first and foremost.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the 2017 darkhorse team from the AFC?
I think Jacksonville will surprise a lot of teams.
Why do you say so?
I think that they already had a great offense, and now that they have signed AJ Bouye and Calais Campbell, it only makes sense for them to get even better. I anticipate they will have a top 3 defense.
I do see them being a great team if and only if that offense, primarily Bortles, can pull back his 2015 form.
Definitely. He wasn't even an efficient QB though that season, that was more him just being a Favre-like gunslinger. I do think that the offense is held to a mid-level ceiling.
What would hold them back, or rather, what do they have to do to overcome repeating basically the Jacksonville side of the last decade?
It all goes back to Bortles and who is going to play RG and TE on the offense as well.
My big concern if I were a Jags fan is that the AFC South though is getting much, much better and I just have my doubts that Jacksonville can overcome Tennessee or Indy, and even Houston.
That is very true.
I think that their WR will be a fun watch as long as Allen Robinson can return to his 2015 form. Who do you think emerges as the slot receiver between Dede Westbrook and Marqise Lee?
That is a great question. They both remind me of each other. I know that the two Allens in Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns will be the outside receivers, but between Marqise and Dede, I am not certain. I think that Dede has the potential to blow the top off of defenses where Marqise Lee is more of the medium, diagonal route running man who may not get the yards after the catch. I think that Jacksonville is in a weird place because they drafted a RB yet they have many WR to share the ball with, I don't know, I think a four receiver set puts them in an awkward position.
Absolutely. I wish the best for Fournette, but I don't think that he will earn his wage or that he will even meet the expectations that people have of him.
Speaking of awkward and weird, Bortles is best in shotgun where Fournette is best running out of the backfield with a fullback or in an ace formation with the QB under center. What does the offensive coordinator do to get the most out of both players?
I think it has to be situational, and this isn't even referring to Bortles or Fournette, but you go gun when you're down or time is low before half and you otherwise go under center and pound the rock as much as you can with Fournette. I would like to see Fournette get 25 or more carries per game.
I would be really impressed if her were to get that many touches, and I mean from carries and receptions.
That is a tough workload for a rookie RB, especially in today's NFL.
If he is getting that many carries, then that can only mean good things for Jacksonville.
Duuuuuvaaaaaall! As my friends in northern Florida would say.
Duuuuuuuuuuvvvvaaaaaalll! hahaha It has to be long drawn out and proud. They will be my "second team" this season as I do think and hope they hold their own in an emerging division.

What did you think of the last Super Bowl?
I thought it was great.  Very entertaining.
Yes,  I like the Super Bowls if they are competitive.
Me too.  Unless my team is in it of course then I don't care if it is lopsided in favor of my team.
That's with all the games I watch if I don't care who wins either way.
New England being in so many Super Bowls drives me nuts though.
I like to see different teams in.
I was kind of pulling for Brady in this Super Bowl though.
Why is that?
I just like the comeback and the underdog coming back.
It makes the game much more heroic that way.
I thought Atlanta had this Super Bowl locked up.
Me too I was surprised Brady was able to bring his team back.
It is what he's done for years.
They are never out of it with him back there.
His passing has been incredible.
The accuracy is amazing.
The other team hardly has a chance the ball comes out do fast and accurate.
New England was lucky to draft such a player.
They've been a dynasty for years as a result.  But he doesn't have many years left.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you guys going to do a Fantasy Football draft again this year?
We do. Why? Do you want in?
I was considering asking if there might be a slot.
I think I can make one this year. Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm even willing to do research for draft picks!
Oh yeah?
Yep. I've been looking at some of what's out there.
What are you thinking so far?
I can't tell you everything! I've gotta keep some stuff close to the vest.
At least give me something.
Well, I know that the way NFL points work, you never draft a kicker first.
That's a no brainer.
Yeah. So I guess I might still be at the starting line.
I mean, you're picking NFL players. Who do you think will do well?
Maybe Antonio Brown?
That's a pretty reasonable pick. People would say that's a smart choice.
Yeah, and I'm a big Steelers fan.
Again with the Steelers.
I can't help it! I like them.
Well, good for you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, are you excited about this upcoming football season?
I totally am! I am hoping to get to a few games this year.
Very cool, I hope that the Cowboys go all the way this year!
I heard a rumor that Tony Romo is going to retire this year, is that true?
Gosh I hope not! Hes my favorite player.
I am really hoping that my team will do well this year. I say that every year and they dont but I wont give up hope.
Really, who is your team?
I really want to see the Lions go all the way to and win the superbowl once in my life time.
HAHA, the Detroit Lions really!!
Heck yeah, Matthew Stafford is the man,  he broke Peyton Manning's record of most fourth quarter comebacks in a season.
That may be true but really, the lions last championship was back in 1957. Thats before you were even born.
I know it but the lions are my home team, what can I say Im loyal!
The cowboys have a much better chance of winning the superbowl in 2017.
Statistically you are right. I'll probably hit some Cowboys games this year.
Makes sense since you live in Texas now. So when Detroit and Dallas play who do you want to win?
Detroit of course! Man it would be cool to go to one of those games, Lions jersey and all!
So do you honestly believe that you will see them win the Superbowl?
I like to think so. I even have money saved to get tickets to the game in case that ever happens.
You really are a die hard fan huh?
Yeah what can I say, they are my home team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There were an awful lot of surprise trades during this NFL offseason
Yes there were, like Marshawn Lynch coming out of retirement to be traded
They say Lynch dreamed of playing for the Raiders, and if he plays as well as they think he can they'll be heading straight to the top
I've never been a huge Raiders fan, but I'd much rather see them in the Superbowl than the Patriots, Steelers, or Broncos for once
If Carr stays healthy, they definitely have a lot of talent to make it there
Last season was a huge bummer seeing Connor Cook make his NFL debut in a big playoff loss
I don't blame him for that, and I don't think anyone should expect a rookie to do that well under so much pressure
At least with Lynch on their team, they won't have to rely on the passing game so much
Speaking of the AFC West, how weird is it to see Jamaal Charles on the Denver Broncos?
It won't be the first time a player was trading to a fierce rival, but it will be interesting to see him play his former team twice each season
It will, and I hope he'll be back to his healthy self
Seeing him in that regular season game a couple years ago scoring something like five touchdowns was amazing
It was, unless you were like me and playing someone in fantasy football who had him on their team
That many touchdowns has got to translate to a lot of fantasy points
In my first fantasy football season, I drafted Adrian Peterson with my first pick in the season where he made his big comeback
I don't know if it's more weird to see Charles on the Broncos, or Peterson in any team other than the Vikings
The Saints definitely need all the help they can get, and it will be interesting to see if he makes another big comeback
He's already a future hall of famer, but that would cement him as one of the greatest players to play the sport
Now the Saints have him and Brees, two of the very best at their positions
Which means there's even more pressure for the Saints not to completely waste the incredible talent on their team
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the NFL still your favorite thing to watch on television?
It sure is! I love football and the NFL is the best!
What team is do you normally cheer for?
I am a die hard Jacksonville Jaguars fan.
Do you think they will ever get back to the playoffs?
One day I feel that we will get there! We just need some things to go our way.
Has the franchise ever made it to the Superbowl before?
Not yet; but when we do I plan on being there live and in person for it!
I am sure you will be there to enjoy that with the team!
We used to be pretty good back when Mark Brunell was the quarterback.
Yea I thought they had some pretty good teams many years ago.
That seems like far to long ago at this point!
Who was the coach when the Jaguars were pretty good there for a while?
It was Tom Coughlin; he knew how to get things done.
Well maybe Doug Marrone can find some of that magic.
I sure hope so! It would be nice to follow a winning team again.
Does the team have any young talent that you are excited about?
We drafted Leonard Fournette out of LSU. I am really pumped about his potential.
I remember watching him play in the SEC. That guy is a beast!
I am hoping he is the next great NFL running back!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Steelers chances this year?
I think they have a good shot at winning 10 or more games and making the playoffs.
Why is that?
Well one thing is that Martavis Bryant will be back.
Yes and also placing the franchise tag on Le'Veon Bell helps.
Correct, if he had gone to another team that would be bad!
Do you think Ben Roethlisberger can stay healthy?
Well at his age that is hard to say, but when he gets hurt he is often able to come back quickly, even playing injured.
And signing Antonio Brown to an extension is good since he's probably the best wide receiver in the league.
Right he's the highest paid receiver for a reason.
What do you know about TJ Watt?
It's tough to predict which college players will do well in the NFL especially towards the bottom of the 1st round but he has a pedigree through his brother.
Do you plan on watching the Steelers game again this year at the local Steelers bar?
Of course!
It looks like the first game won't be on TV here in Philadelphia since the Eagles play at the same time on the same network.
Ok we will go to the bar then.
What do you think the score will be?
Well even with Myles Garrett the Browns are still pretty bad so even on the road I think the Steelers win by something like 28-17.
Yeah that is what I thought too, a relatively easy Steelers win.  Talk to you later!
Good talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL rookie going into next season?
I don't know all that much about any of them, but I'm excited to see how Myles Garrett does with the Browns
Yeah, as the first pick overall, all eyes are on him to succeed
Even if the Browns are the worst team in the league, one player isn't going to completely turn it around
What do you think the Browns need to really turn their luck around?
Better coaching and better front office personnel, I would guess
And a decent quarterback who isn't always getting injured would probably help
Can you believe how many quarterbacks they've gone through just over the past few seasons?
And to think they could have drafted someone solid, like Dak Prescott, who no one expected to completely take off
Maybe they'll have that kind of luck with DeShone Kizer
I don't know enough about him to know one way or the other, but I'm a bit surprised they even drafted a quarterback
They're just full of surprises after picking up Brock Osweiler from the Texans
That was one of the craziest trades I've seen in the NFL, and a pretty rare thing from what I hear
I wonder if they'll use Osweiler as their starter this season?
A lot of people were speculating that they would try to trade him away, but it hasn't happened yet
They also said the Browns might try to get Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots, but their asking price was just too high
I guess you don't get as many great players on one team without being a bit stingy
Maybe, but Jimmy G hasn't had much time to prove himself, and might end up being as big a bust as Osweiler was
Then again, if he's being mentored by Tom Brady, he could end up being the next Brady himself
That's a pretty big gamble to take, if you ask me, probably too high of a risk for most teams
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey I gotta extra Miami Dolphins jersey, you want one?
Sure, I'll take one.
I have so many extra football jerseys, brand new.
Do you have Dan Marino?
Yeah, I got him and all the rest, I got other teams too.
I like the Bulls.
Yeah they actually made it to the playoffs last year.
When you gonna send me that Dolphins jeresey?
I can send it to you first thing tommorow morning.
Okay, that would be great. I'll wear it when they play.
Dan Marino is doing Weight Watchers.
He is on Weight Watchers?
He's now working for Weight Watchers.
He doesn't ball anymore?
He retired a while ago. :(
I love the way he would throw that ball
Yeah, he did have a unique spin on it.
He should make a comeback.
If we get a tight team we can get a championship next season.
Yes, but the team management has to know what they are doing in order to get a tight team going.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think of Tyrod Taylor and how the Buffalo Bills will do this year?
Hmmm, with new coach Sean McDermott, they should be able to establish some momentum.
I think the receiving corps is weakened with several key departures.
Yeah, Sammy Watkins is the only threat for Buffalo.
How do you feel about Colin Kaepernick getting a backup quarterback role?
Not sure if any teams want him due to the possible negative publicity, but he can still play.
Will RGIII be able to sign with a team this year?
He has the tools as a backup quarterback, just needs to prove himself again.
What do you think of the L.A. Chargers new logo?
It's really a rip-off - they should have come up with something better than that.
How will the Redskins do with Kirk Cousin's contract not done?
Washington is a joke and they are headed for another .500 season.
Do you think the Patriots will be in the Superbowl again?
Yes, they have all the tools yet again. A healthy Gronkowski will only take them further.
Will Tom Brady have a decline this year?
He is a system quarterback, and he knows the system so well in New England. No way he declines.
Who do you think is the best free agent pickup this year?
DeSean Jackson provides the speed and the attitude for Tampa Bay. He will be stellar in that system.
Is Christian McCaffrey going to be a bust?
That is a hard one to answer... his skills don't necessarily translate, so we will have to see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about all the rookies going into the league this year.
I think they will do the teams good.
I agree. Each team needed some.
Especially the colts alot have retired.
Who has retired?
Pat Mcaffe has retired.
Wow he did?
Yep! Just last year.
Wow. I thought he would go farther.
Me too!
Robert Mathis also retired.
I heard that.
The rookies will help all the teams.
I agree and they are new and young.
They are healthier too.
The Cowboys rookie last year did good for Tony Romo.
Yes they were great last year.
They could win it all.
I bet they coud.
I cannot wait to watch them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many football teams are in the NFL?
I think there are 32.
Is that more than when we were kids?
Yes, they added some teams since then.
What teams were added?
They now have the Ravens, Jaguars, and Carolina Panthers.
Do they still have the Cleveland Browns?
Yes, they didn't have a team for 8 years, but then came back again.
Who is your favorite expansion team?
I like the Jaguars.  Their colors are cool.
That was cool when they came out.  I got all their garb.
Me too.  I love that color blue.
What other merchandise do you like to purchase?
Believe it or night, I like the sneakers with logos.
Do you like big or little logos.
I go big!
I don't like it too big.  What is they lose that year?
No problem, I'm true to my team.
I'm like a cat, fickle and finicky.  I don't always stand by my team.
I'm like a watch dog, sticking to my team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What city do you think will be the next to get an NFL team?
Well obviously Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
I meant other than those.
Yeah I know.  St. Louis might get one.
Yeah, the Rams were a big loss for them.
Toronto might get one too in the future.
Yeah, but Buffalo might try to block it since it encroaches on their area.
True.  Sacramento may be an option.
They have a big media market.
It is much bigger than most people think.
I think it is like the 19th biggest media market or something.
I think that the NFL wants a team in London.
They want the global market.
They sure do!
Another city might be Mexico City.
It is the largest city in North America.
It has something like 20 million people.
They have a lot of NFL fans down there.
The Raiders, 49ers and Cowboys are all popular.
Their Azteca Stadium is pretty cool too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy watching NFL football games?
I'm a big fan have been since I was a kid.
Did you ever play some football yourself?
I played some high school varsity but that's it.
I played the same, never got to play college football.
What position did you play?
I played Left guard and linebacker you?
Wide receiver and cornerback.
Did you like playing those positions?
I loved catching the ball, you?
I loved hitting people.
Sounds like we both played what we wanted to.
I can't agree more.
Want to watch the Patriots play this weekend?
Sure.
Want to come over to my place?
Yo got food?
Sure do, having nachos and pizza.
I'll bring the beer.
Sounds like a plan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about some of the  obscure rules governing the NFL?
I don't know any of them. Enlighten me.
NFL agreement says that players must be reimbursed up to $122 per day for food expenses that the team doesn't provide meals while on the road.
That sounds like a lot of money to me. But I guess it isn't if you figure it out with tips included.
Well get this if you are one of the big boys who is overweight by their standards a player may have to pay up to $630 a pound that he is over the limit.
What!!! Wow if that isn't motivation to keep in shape I don't know what is!
Here's another one that is not so harsh. Players are guaranteed 4 days off  a month
Sounds reasonable i guess.
The unsportsmanlike  conduct one is kind of iffy to me.
How so?
Well it obviously covers things like aggressive  behavior that results in injury. But excessive  celebration  is listed as mental hurt.
.That seems a little ridiculous.
I am with you on that one. because it is left up to the referee's interpretation of what is too much
.I think that is totally ridiculous rule.
Yes because what if for some reason that referee doesn't personally like that player
Then biased would be involved.
Exactly. Also what about the fact who doesn't want to express their happiness at doing well.
That is very true. Seems like they want to take the fun out of it for some people.
What's really dumb is that the fans enjoy the spectacle so why rob them of that.
Especially  considering  how much they pay for tickets
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi There.
Hello.
Are you a football fan?
Yeah sure am.
Do you like college or nfl, or both?
I like both really.
Do you like one more than the other?
I like the pros a bit more I think.
Why is that?
The skill level is a lot higher and I like that.
That's a good reason.
What about you?
I like the pros as well but still catch a bit of college games.
Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Falcons.  What about you?
I'm a Seahawks fan.
Oh cool, I like Russell Wilson a lot.
He's the man.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Broncos will be able to compete again this year?
I think they will be good, that defense is top notch.
Yeah but who is gonna start for them
I would assume Trevor Siemian again
What about paxton lynch?
I dont think he is their future QB. Too many questions.
They took him in the first round!
Better to admit a mistake before it gets bad.
I think Chad Kelly might end up the starter at the end of the year
He didnt show me enough in college.
He was pretty good
Yeah but nothing he specifically did translates to the NFL
I dont know about that, he had a good run.
Well back to Denver, if their defense sucks then they might be in trouble.
I just think they really regress this year.
Will Elway ever come down and coach?
I think he likes being an executive more than that.
Yeah me too.
They should be able to compete but that division belongs to Oakland.
Never count out Denver though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you consider of a big NFL fan?
Absolutely. What about you?
Definitely. I love the NFL. Being from Ohio, are you a Browns fan?
Well, yes and no. I tend to have a love/hat relationship with Cleveland.
That is interesting. Why do you say that?
They are considered the "Home team", but it's difficult at times to get behind them.
They were considered the "worst team in the NFL" last season.
Yes, that is correct and I do recall hearing that.
Are most of your friends and family Browns fans?
Oh yes, absolutely. And that is why I try to stay behind them.
Because if they do well, your friends and family will be happy?
Yes, pretty much. If the Browns do better, than it's a happy day for those close to me.
That is a decent enough reason to get behind a somewhat negative-received team.
I think so, as well. Not only that, but I am also a fan of the underdog.
It seems that when it comes to the Browns, they either do really well or really poorly most of the time.
Yes, I can see that point.
They have had some real negative defeats but also some decent wins over the years. Who would you consider their best rival?
Most would say the Ravens, but I actually think the Steelers.
Interesting point. Why do you say?
I think because Browns/Steelers games always are fun to watch and usually competitive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does football season start?
I think preseason starts pretty soon?
Dallas might do well this year.
Particularly since Romo is out of the picture.
What about New England?
Depends if Brady decides to retire
He should retire
Yes. Brady has won enough
What about Peyton? What is he doing these day?
Not sure, other than Nationwide and Papa John's commercials.
Do all NFL players get commercials
Depends how good they are or were.
It seems like broadcasting is part of the ritual as well.
The younger crowd may not even know that the announcers were once players.
I am hoping the Jets will do well this year.
They had some issues with Sanchez, but they should be getting better.
What about the Giants and Eli
I am not sure how much longer Eli will be there. We'll see.
As long as someone else wins this year. New England needs to be dethroned
Agreed. Someone new this year should win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your sleeper team for this year?
Tampa Bay Bucs are looking scary on offense.
Didn't they get Jackson the wideout?
Yep, he is super dangerous.  They also picked up a tight end in the draft.
They have put together a lot of tools for Winston.
It is going to be hard for defenses to pick who to cover.
Winston might have a break out year with all these options.
The downside might be trying to keep everyone happy.
Those wideouts and tight ends are all going to want the ball, yep, you are right.
This is going to be a good problem to have.
Adding Jackson into the mix means every play could go the length of the field.
The guy is really dangerous when he is used right.
The real sleeper is the new tight end.
Keeping those chains moving is idea.
Having good players all around is a luxury.
They are really loaded up.  Teams are going to have a hard time on defense.
Winston will be in the conversation when it comes to stats.
They just have to keep him protected.
Pass rush might be the only thing that can slow him down.
Winston is big and strong, he just has to stay healthy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when the Falcons too Ryan in 2008.
They grabbed him in the second pick right?
They grabbed him in the second pick right?
Yeah, I think it was the second pick and they only got him for a fraction of what the Bills got EJ for.
EJ is playing with some real vets.
Yes, but the Bills don't have a single Super Bowl player on the team.
The Bills has a fresh line up, but that also means they don't have a bunch of bad habits.
I guess they can improve once their head coach is gone.
Flacco did get some good playoff wins.
He did have some impressive plays. None of them got Flacco to the finals.
Let's hope Flacco's new contract can get him to the finals.
It shouldn't take him more than two seasons to hit the finals.
You are assuming they keep their head coach. Flacco has never taken to new leadership well.
Yeah, he did interfere with the new running back a few times.
Dalton and Rogers got overlooked in the draft.
I didn't even know their contracts were up.
Their contracts have both been open since last season.
Free agents usually don't go for the bidding wars, but I guess they are staying put for now.
Dalton, can't be that picky. It's not like he's going to get on a playoff team.
The Broncos were courting him, but I don't know what happened with the negotiations.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you know if Palmer is playing this season?
You mean the quarter back for Arizona? I think so. At least I haven't heard otherwise...
I was just wondering. I thought they were looking for a new QB.
I'm sure they are looking. Their defense is pretty solid but they do need more offensive players.
Yeah, I was thinking the same. Like they need good receivers.
At least they have a good running back though.
Who? Oh, you mean the Johnson guy.
Yup, David Johnson. He's pretty exciting. Reminds me of Mike Bell.
Who did he play for?
He was a free agent played for Broncos, dolphins, Saints...he was on the team when they won the Superbowl.
He doesn't play any more?
I don't think so. Anyway David Johnson reminds me of Bell. Like same type of player.
Maybe he will be a lucky charm for the Cardinals.
You know who can use a lucky charm?
Who? I'm sure there are several...
The Browns!
Oh my gosh! They need a lot more than a lucky charm...like they need a whole football team!
Hahaha...you are right. They had the worst season ever!
They can only improve now,right?
Yeah, I can't imagine how they can play worse!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My father went to a charity dinner earlier and was kind of bored. He was ready to leave until he saw a man's Giants hat. Then my mother had to drag him away.
I'm guessing he's a Giants fan?
Yup, a huge one!
Does he watch all their games?
Yes, he does. He even has a regular routine where he always orders pizza for Sunday football.
What does he do when there are no new Sunday football games?
Sometimes he watches videos from a DVD he has of the most recent season where the Giants won the SuperBowl.
Are you a fan of football too?
Not particularly. By osmosis, I like the Giants and dislike the Patriots.
That's funny. Any other team preferences?
I have a soft spot for Seattle, as I once read an article about one of the players and he seemed very intelligent.
Do you know the rules of football?
Not as much as I maybe should, but mostly!
Where did you learn them?
It would make sense if I learned it from the football games I watched while I was in marching band. But I actually learned most of the rules from Eyeshield 21.
That's the goofy football manga/anime, right?
That's right! Anyway, my dad's been trying to teach me more about NFL football recently.
Really? What kinds of things?
A little more about trading and how they determine who makes the Superbowl. I still find the wildcard thing kind of weird.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
It's fun to watch!
Agreed!
What's your favorite team?
Patriots
Too cheap!
No!
Yea they are!
How so?
They cheat all the time to win!
Never!
Everyone knows it!
You just hate winners!
No I hate those that cant play fair
They do1
I dont see us agreeing
I'll agree to that
Bye!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Cowboys defense will be next season.
It should be great compared to last season!
Huh? They lost several key defensive players over the season.
Like who?
Nolan Carroll and Barry Church are two that come to mind.
Yeah they were ok last season but they gave up big plays. The team didn't lose much.
How are they going to make up for those guys and the others they lost on defense?
Did you not watch the draft this year?
Not really. Who did the Cowboys pick up?
They used their first pick on Taco Charlton a defensive end out of Michigan.
Never heard of him.
He is a beast! Taco will be an impact player his first league in the year.
That sounds promising. Who else did they pick up?
Chidobe Awuzie! Say that five times fast. He is a cornerback from Colorado.
That is a strange name. So they used their first two picks for defensive players. That's a good sign.
Yeah they made great choices with those two and they also picked up two more cornerbacks and a safety with their remaining picks.
Wow! They did go defense heavy in the draft.
The Cowboys are not dumb. They saw the problems last year and went out and got what they needed.
It seems like it. How good do you expect such a young defense to be?
There will be some growing pains for sure but I think they will step up and get the job done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How could the Colts keep Pagano?
They still can't be as bad as last year.
The defense should improve some espeically with Hooker.
Yeah but it will still probably be awful.
The AFC is garbage.
Yeah the Pats will probably stroll though again.
The Steelers could be good.
Ben will get hurt like every year.
Maybe the whole league is garbage.
Not sure who is actually good.
Andrew Luck has to make the leap this year.
If he doesn't now when will he?
I don't knwo he's almost 30.
If he doesn't break out this year maybe he's just average.
I hope not.
The recievers are good the line is better there should be no exuses.
Well the coaches still suck.
He has to get past that.
If he doesn't there will be all new coaches again next year.
Well at least Pagano will get fired.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This NFL offseason has been interesting.
Yeah there have been some surprises and a lot of teams seemed poised to make it a competitive year.
There is one move that has me confused. Joe Montana comparing Colin Kepernick's situation to Tim Tebow.
What did he say?
He said that it was his subpar completion percentage that did him in.
That's not fair Tebow had a forty something percent completion rate and Kapernick was mid to high fifties.
Right. So Tebow we understand. You can't make it long in the NFL with those numbers.
Kapernick's completion percentage is better than some starting quarter backs.
Exactly. So why is he not signed?
OK. So the owners are saying it's the fans. They don't want him.
He has apologized to the league and stated that he will stand for the National Anthem going forward and he still isn't signed.
Do you think he's been blacklisted?
It seems that way. That and his performance.
So he isn't winning enough to make his not so distant past go away.
I think so. I've heard he also will only sign if he is going to start.
The only team that would be desperate enough to pick him up is the Jets.
They haven't even spoken to him and they are about to make the Cleveland Browns look good this season.
Maybe this is it for him in the NFL. I heard the Cubs drafted him out of highschool.
So maybe he is just like Tebow and he can go play baseball.
America's favorite past time may not appreciate him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wiil Marvin Lewis coach the Bengals next year?
Yup...as long as he has a contract
What do you mean?
Mike Brow does not like to get rid of coaches while on contract
I see...but they have not won a playof game since the 90s,right?
Doesn't matter. Mike Brown does not pay coaches not to coach.
So you guys are stuck with him then
Yes,..sigh
So who should they hire?
Urban Meyer
Nope. Not leaving Ohio State.
True. One can dream though
There has got to be a up and coming coordinator out there some where
Well when you find him, let me know
So how many games do you think the Bungles will when?
Five, and that is being hopeful
Two of them will be against Cleveland...
LOL....yup
God Bless the Cincinnati Bengals
Don't think God can help them
XXXXXXXXXXX
What tackle would you take to anchor your line?
Tackle?  I'd have to think about that one.
Well, don't take too long, the season will be here for before you know it.
Alright, I'm ready.  This might be controversial.
I'm ready for it.
I'd go with Tyron Smith.
How is that controversial?
I don't know.  I just thought you'd say somebody different.
No, Smith for sure.  He's still so young and seems like he's been in the league forever.
Yeah, it's nuts he's only 26.
He probably has another decade in front of him still.
The Cowboys drafted him very young out of USC.
The only player who echoes him talent wise is Joe Thomas.
Thomas is so steady and consistent.
And he's done it for a decade now.  Just day in and day out.
It bites he's on a bad team.
Yeah, Browns have never had talent around him.
Their line is getting better though.
Yeah, they made some good investments there, but Thomas will start regressing soon.
He needs a good RB to block for.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, the NFL preseason starts up August 3rd
That's right, Cowboys & Cardinals in the Hall of Fame game
Who you think is going to win it all this year?
Probably the Patriots again; Tom Brady just seems so talented and the offense just clicks with him at the helm
Yeah, I agree. Anybody else have an outside shot?
Well not in the AFC, but in the NFC, I'd have to say the Cowboys or the Falcons could give the Patriots a good game.
Sounds about right. The Cowboys have great balance with Dak Prescott at QB and Ezekiel Elliott in the backfield.
Very true, they can go either run or pass on any snap and move the ball downfield with ease.
And the Cowboys defense is nothing to sneeze at either
The Falcons have Matt Ryan at QB, and he's a very capable passer who doesn't throw many interceptions
Yeah, considering he got sacked 37 times last year, I'm surprised he didn't panic pass more
Outside of those two teams, I don't see anyone capable of challenging the Patriots
How about the other end of the spectrum......who's going to have the worst record?
The Browns almost went winless last year, upsetting the Chargers in game 15 and finishing the year at 1-15
They might improve by 2 wins this year. I don't see how the Rams managed 4 wins with the league's worst offense
And the 49ers with the league's worst defense managed only 2 wins.
Yeah, the Bears and the Jaguars round out the bottom 5 with 3 wins apiece
But there could be a case made for the Jets to be this years worst, even going 0-16
Why's that?
Because there ain't no quarterback & a bunch off season trades puts them in even worse position than last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Minnesota Vikings?
I really only watch them in the playoffs.
I am somewhat of a fan.
Do you think they have a chance to win this year?
They will win games definitely.
You know what I am asking!
I am not sure if they can win a superbowl.
Do you like Sam Bradford?
He put up some great stats for the Vikings this season.
I didn't know that.
Yeah he played like a hall of famer.
What were his stats like?
He put up 20 touchdowns, only 5 interceptions, and had a rating of 99.3.
Those are really efficient stats!
Yeah Minnesota was lucky to get him from the Eagles.
I remember him being on their roster.
He didn't play nearly as great for the Eagles.
How were his stats with them?
He had one less touchdown with nine more interceptions.
Well you must be happy he's helping Minnesota now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season to start! What game are you looking forward to most?
I can't wait to watch Atlanta's home opener versus Green Bay!
That should be an awesome game, a rematch from last season.
Yeah, but it's early enough in the season that each roster should be pretty healthy.
Isn't that the first official game at the new stadium in Atlanta, too?
Yes, the new stadium looks awesome from what I can tell, but I'm really looking forward to seeing Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan.
Two of the better quarterbacks in the league right now, that's for sure.
They both have this crazy ability to keep the offense moving, even against the clock.
Well, when you have Jordy Nelson and Julio Jones to throw to, I imagine it's like playing backyard football.
Both Aaron and Matt just naturally like to air it out, but having such great receivers means a nightmare situation for both defenses.
Green Bay and Atlanta both need to improve on defense though, because both teams have lost on the big stage because of their defense.
I think Atlanta is slowly building on that side of the ball, signing some great rookies like Vic Beasley in the last couple of years.
Vic is a beast! He is really disruptive on the line and seems to play to the whistle, which is more than I can say about a lot of guys.
Green Bay has quite a few weapons, too! Mike Daniels plays mean and it's so fun to watch him stuff the run and get after the quarterback.
I agree that Mike is a great player, but Green Bay needs to improve their secondary. They allowed some of the most yards in the NFL last year!
I know that by the end of the season they had guys off of their practice squad starting in the playoffs, but there is no excuse for the poor play earlier in the season.
That corner that they have, Damarious Randall, used to be a basketball star, so I'm surprised he hasn't been doing better.
He did have a couple multiple pick games, but consistency was his issue.
He constantly got outrun on routes and had terrible vision, but luckily, Ha Ha Clinton-Dix was there to assist.
That guy is one of the real star safeties in the league, hard to believe he has only played a couple of seasons professionally.
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL Season starts in exactly 2 months with Pats, and Chiefs. Who you got?
Come on man, you can't bet against Brady and the Pats.
That is true but it's the regular season, the Chiefs are winners of the regular season.
Ha, they really are, but I'm more looking forward to the Sunday night game with the boys, and Giants.
Dak and Zeek are fun to watch.
Mix that in with OBJ and it should be a fun watch.
Who you think will take the NFC east this year?
You gotta go with the boys, because Eli stinks, The Eagles are young, and who knows what you will get out of the Skins.
I was hoping Cousins and the skins turn it around.
He is getting a raw deal in Washington. I want to see him go somewhere else.
You mean like Cleveland?
HAHA! Now that is a funny joke.
Don't know when the Browns will turn it around, but it has to happen one day.
You would think law of averages would be on their side but them and the Lions always seem to be bad.
Yep, neither have been to the Super Bowl ever, and both haven't won a championship since the 50's.
Honestly I wonder sometimes what it's like to be a fan of those teams.
It has to be rough as you are constantly bad, or just never win.
At least the Lions have some talent and are bareable to watch. The Browns are just awful.
Lions actually have a decent chance to win a few games, but the Browns are still far away.
Yep. Which means the NFL is all the same this year and the Patriots will win another Super Bowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are your Redskins looking for next season?
Pretty good, I hope! This Kirk Cousins thing is out of control though.
Oh, I don't know what that is.
He is our quarterback, and basically he and the Red Skins still haven't come to a long-term agreement for his contract.
Oh no! When do they have to reach an agreement by?
They need to reach an agreement by July 17th.
Oh wow, that is soon. What is the issue?
His pay. If they don't come to an agreement, he'll get paid about $24 million for just next year.
Oh I see. Hasn't he been pretty good for the Redskins?
Definitely! He was a bit of a wildcard, but he has been very good.
What happens if they don't reach an agreement?
If they don't, it could be his last season with the Redskins, and we need him a lot!
Oh no, so this could cost the Redskins a lot of money and a good player.
Exactly, hopefully it'll work out. Are you planning on going to any games this year?
Of course. I'm a big Cowboys fan, so I'm trying to plan a trip to go see them.
Oh that would be really awesome. Where is their stadium?
It's actually in Arlington, Texas, not Dallas.
Oh interesting. I have never been there. I went to a Falcons game at the Georgia dome last year.
Oh, how was that?
It was awesome. The Falcons are building a new stadium soon though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe Dak Prescott supposedly doesn't provide real autographs?
Where did you hear that I think that's absurd?
It was said on ESPN, Bleacherreport, and NFL.com so I would believe it.
Well if ESPN told you to jump off a bridge would you believe it?
No that's beside the point.
So if he isn't using his real autograph then what is he using instead?
ESPN said that he's using a machine to do his autographs.
Well how did they find out this is true?
Well the grading workers were able to tell that his autograph did not look authentic.
What???  I find that crazy.
I'm wondering how this is going to effect Dak Prescotts image?
I don't know if it will actually make him look any different.
Yet Dak is a great quarterback and everyone makes mistakes.
Yeah maybe he was busy and just didn't have the time to sign all the autographs.
Yeah working under Jerry Jones probably would be a great challenge.
Yeah Jerry Jones probably keeps his workers pretty busy.
I'm wondering how the card companies are going to fix this problem with Prescott?
Alot of people who bought the card received autograph cards from Dak Prescott because they got redemptions in the pack of cards.
I know if I received an autograph that wasn't real I wouldn't be happy
Yeah that is pretty messed up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you still like the NFL even with all the concussion issues?
Yes, I love watching football. That hasn't changed for me.
But don't you think it is too dangerous?
I think those are all adult men making a decision to play, and they know the risks.
I have a hard time watching anymore.
I still love the game and I don't think it is different than any other sport, or even extreme sports.
I guess that is true.
They have implemented rules to try to make the game safer, like the helmet-to-helment and targeting rules.
But that doesn't physically stop players from doing it.
No, you are right, but I think there are fewer instances.
Maybe. It is just so intense.
That is what I like about it. I think it is so much more interesting and engaging than other sports.
There is definitely more action than in baseball, I'll agree.
For sure. And I've never been a huge fan of hockey or basketball. I just really love the NFL.
What's your favorite team?
The Patriots, but I genuinely like watching all the games.
So you are as much a fan of the game as you are a team.
Well, I'm definintely a Patriots fan, but I am certainly a fan of the game too.
I just don't understand grown men running into each other over a ball.
Well, it is a bit more complex than that! Maybe you should give it another chance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win NFC North this year.
I'm not sure.
I'm thinking it will be the Lions.
Really?
Yeah, I think this is their year.
They have been pretty poor for a long time.
They have.  But I think they have built a pretty good team.
I'm not so sure about that.
Who would you pick?
I always think the Packers will be in the running.
They usually are.
They on the other hand have been good for many years now.
They have.
Ted Thompson does a great job building the team.
He does.
They seem to have an eye for young talent.
They do.
And they build their players well.
I think they give them great skills in practice.
That is exactly right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the most games next season?
It could be several different teams.
Who do you think has the best chance?
I would have to say the Chiefs.
Is Alex Smith a reliable Quarterback?
He has something to prove this season.
Why do you say that?
He threw five fewer touchdowns in the 2016 season compared to 2015.
Nice observation he will want to get better.
He is a few years younger then Brady but has never won a superbowl.
Wow I wonder if he can do it next season.
I am hoping he can.
How are his other stats?
One thing I think he should work on is interceptions.
Yeah a high number of interceptions can make it tougher to win games.
Especially if one team is turning it over the whole game.
I am sure he will want to keep his interception number low.
Definitely he will want too.
I am excited to watch the Chiefs next season.
They have a great fanbase.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Almost football season!
Yes, NFL summer camp just ended and preseason starts in four weeks.
Patriots might win it all again.
Another great team for them this year?
Yes. Actually I thought the Cowboys had a chance last year to win it all.
Yea, their playoff experience was too young last year.
They have a good chance, but we will see.
Are there any quarterbacks throughout the league that are standouts?
Drew Brees is still with the New Orleans Saints.
He's been around awhile.
Yea, probablya few more years left for him.
Aaron Rodgers still is quarterback for the Green Bay Packers.
He's been there awhile. But he's still good.
Have they been in the playoffs lately.
Yea, they make the playoffs almost every year.
Of course, Tom Brady always brings the Patriots to the playoffs.
Yes, and beyond!
Another great quarterback is Prescott for the Cowboys.
He's pretty young though and doesn't have enough experience.
Well,we'll see who wins it all!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Raiders move to Las Vegas?
I think that stinks.
I heard the Raiders players will save big on taxes because of this deal.
Really?
Yes, Nevada has no income taxes.
So they are doing it for money.
The Raiders can offer players lower contracts they will save millions in taxes.
What does Derek Carr earn?
He has a 125 million contract.
Wow that is nuts.
So by moving Carr will save over 8 million in taxes compared to California.
Who wants to play out there then?
I guess the players love the move.
The fans are the only ones who suffer from this move.
It is only a business.
The ownership must be getting some financial benefit from the move then.
The Raiders can now sign other stars like Khalil Mack to deals.
Makes sense for them all around
I liked the Oakland Coliseum.
That's how it goes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the NFL?
I don't know.
How about football in general?
It's kind of violent.
Yes, it can be, but so are all sports.
Is baseball as violent as football?
I guess not, no. Do you like NFL football?
Yes, I enjoy NFL football.
Even though it's violent?
Yes, even though it's violent.
Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Bengals.
So you do follow football?
I guess I do, yes. I like Dalton and his play.
How are they doing this year?
They're doing well, I guess.
That's good. Will they go to the playoffs?
I don't know, I don't follow NFL football.
I thought you liked the Bengals?
I know, I thought so too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football is right around the corner.
I know I can't  wait. Who do you think we are going to see in the Super Bowl?
I don't know, but I can tell you who I'd like to see. Falcons and Raiders.
Wow! I don't think it's likely but what an amazing match up.
Two amazing offenses, two amazing defenses. It would be a real game.
You're right it would be a close game too. Who would win?
Again I don't know, but I'd give money to see Marshawn Lynch talking to reporters after that game.
That would be entertainment enough. Speaking of Beast Mode, what about the Seahawks?
If they can get their locker room issues we could see them in the big game. It's football so I mean anyone could really make it.
Who would you want to see them play.
If Texas can figure out who is going to throw the ball
That would be an interesting game but I don't see it happening. The Titans have some cleaning up to do.
Seattle is going deep again though. I wouldn't be surprised if they went all the way once all the egos and feelings got put aside.
Patriots against Seattle?
It would be a good game, but New England would walk all over Seattle.
Seattle against the Raiders?
The Raiders would have to make their way through New England and Pittsburgh and that's not going to happen.
But it would be fun!
Yeah watching Lynch play his old team and win!?
Anything can happen!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ready to see Kirk Cousins light up the field this year?
No doubt. Can't wait for football season to start.
Me either. My Redskins are looking great.
They don't look better than my Giants though.
Giants do look sick, I'll admit.
You know how we do... One good year and then one bad year and then back to good!
Maybe they can slay the Pats again this year.
Someone has to do it. We know the Falcons and Seahawks can't!
Who else does the Redskisn have this year?
I missed the draft, but I know we got that great new running back.
He looks crazy good.
Yes indeed. I can't wait to see how moving through holes.
I'm excited to see Christian McCaffrey as well.
He's just what the Panthers need.
That and an actual decent receiver.
True. Benjamin is looking a bit big nowadays.
He's the Eddie Lacy of the Panthers!
I heard he lost weight.
He did, supposedly, but he obviously has no self control. Seahawks might have messed up.
We will see. Can't wait to see them play Marshawn this season!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know during broadcast NFL games, cheerleaders are on TV for only about 3 seconds.
Really? only 3 seconds? That doesn't seem like a lot.
Yeah, I heard they don't make very much.
I heard NFL cheerleaders typically make $50–$75 a game. However, by the time they spend money on makeup, hair accessories, dance classes, etc., they end up losing money.
Eek, that's a shame. Do they all have cheerleaders?
No, actually 6 teams in the NFL don’t employ cheerleaders: the Bears, the Browns, the Lions, the Giants, the Steelers, and the Packers.
I thought all NFL teams had them. Like it was requirement.
No. Super Bowl XLV was the first Super Bowl with no cheerleaders at the game because neither the Steelers and the Packers have cheerleaders.
That is crazy. I can't get enough NFL facts. I wonder what they did for half time.
You know I don't remember. But the the most famous NFL cheerleading squad is the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders who was originally a male/female group called the CowBelles & Beaux.
I definitely don't remember that. I didn't know they even had mixed cheerleading squad in NFL. I thought that was college thing.
As of September 2012, the Dallas Cowboys were the highest-valued sports franchise in the history of the United States. You know they do things big in Texas!
Yes, they do! I've always been a big fan.
Yeah, the Dallas franchise to me is one of the best. They just go all out.
Agreed. It's got to be your second fave if your team isn't playing well.
Yeah and one of the most lucrative.
What do you mean?
The wealthiest team in the NFL is the Dallas Cowboys who have an estimated value of approximately $2.1 billion and generate almost $269 million in annual revenue.
Holy cow!
Yeah, I imagine some big oil tycoon owning the team, sitting behind a big mahogany desk and wearing a 10 gallon hat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how do you think the Panthers will do this year?
Gosh, I don't know.  When is their first game?
They play the 49ers on September 10th.
Oh wow, that seems late.
Yeah, the season starts September 7th I think.
Is it a home game?
Yes for the 49ers.
Well how do you think they'll do?
I don't know.  I hope they have a better season
Did they draft some good players?
Well, I don't know.  I know they got McCaffrey and Samuel.
Are they supposed to be good?
I guess we'll find out!
Well the 49ers haven't done too well.
Yeah it should be a close game.
Hopefully both teams will have a better season this year.
I hope so for their sake!
Maybe their new players can help turn things around.
Yeah.  I still like watching the Panthers play.
That's probably just because we're from North Carolina.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Chiefs hired a new GM?
No, I haven't been paying much attention this off season.
Yeah, I guess they let the last one go and it doesn't sound like it ended well.
Hmm, I wonder what could have happened, but I'm sure we'll never know everything.
The new GM sounds like he's been a coach or part of the team before, so hopefully that'll help.
I sure hope so! The Chiefs could really use some good luck.
I know, it's been years since they've even come close to making it to the Super Bowl!
It's been really hard to be a fan all these years, but yet we still show up every year.
Yep, and the ticket prices keep going up!
Yeah, my siblings have season tickets in the lower level and they're $850 for ten games! Don't even get me started on parking.
The parking is highway robbery!
I think I saw that it can get up to $60 per car if you don't pre-pay!
Man, that would be a nightmare! I'd never pay that to let my car sit in a parking lot!
Neither would I. I think I'm going to sit the season out and cheer on from home.
That sounds like it'll be easier. Maybe I can join you?
Absolutely! Let's start our own Chiefs Sunday tradition!
Maybe if we don't go, they'll do better. It wouldn't hurt to try!
I sure hope so. I haven't seen a Super Bowl with the Chiefs in my lifetime.
My parents had barely seen it either! Here's to hoping!
Let's go Chiefs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the upcoming NFL season?
Can't wait for it to begin.
What team are you going for this year?
The Giants.
I'm going to stick with my Cowboys.
They have some pretty good players this year.
Yes, like Heath, when they let him play.
Right. In the past couple of years Heath has accounted for five turnovers, four interceptions and one forced fumble.
You seem to know your stuff.
I said my team is the Giants, I didn't say I don't keep up on stats concerning other players.
Alright, alright.
You know, another good Cowboy player is Jason Witten.
Yeah, but he is getting up there in age.
You sound, like you are saying he is fragile, ha ha.
No I'm not saying that, it's just that injuries do happen.
The dude has played with fractured ribs, a concussion, a lacerated spleen and a sprained knee.
Now you make him sound like he is unstoppable.
Call it what you will.
We will see how he plays this season.
I will be keeping an eye out for him and of course watch my Giants.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that story about The Raiders?
No?
They are changing cities.
Again?
Yeah, they are going to Vegas.
Wow!  Vegas?  Thats crazy.
I read that they are hoping to capitalize on all of the tourism in Vegas.
That makes sense but how many times have the Raiders moved?
At least three times.
Dang.  I wonder why they move so much.
Who knows?
They seem to have a decent fan base .
Yeah - they had a decent season with a 12-4 record.
Not bad.
But they haven't won a super bowl since 1983.
Thats a long time.
Yeah.  Probably won't change by changing cities.
You are probably right.
I wonder if tickets will be cheap in Vegas.
Maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Mark, are you ready for the NFL season to start?
I sure am, I can't wait!
Same here, who do you think will win it all?
I'm not entirely sure, but I think the Patriots will have a chance to defend their title.
I'm afraid I have to agree with you, but I hope some other team wins the Superbowl, I'm getting tired of the Patriots always winning.
Me too, but you can't deny that they are a great team.
They sure are!
Who do you think can beat them?
Hmmm, well Atlanta should still be a good team.
Yeah, if they can shake off that horrible loss.
True, true...Green Bay and Dallas should both be pretty good this year.
Yes!  With their young talent, Dallas should have a great year.
For some reason, I also like Kansas City's chances.
Kansas City?  Really?
Yeah, I'm not sure why, but they always seem to be pretty good.
Pretty good isn't always good enough in the NFL though.
Thats true.
It will definitely be an interesting season.
I agree.  I am so looking forward to the season.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, it's almost football preseason!  Are you excited?
Yes, but I wish it would start a little later in the year.
Absolutely!  It's too hot for football.  I feel sorry for those guys.
For sure, it would also be nice if baseball was over and we could concentrate on football.
Yeah, they should look into starting the season later and extending it into the following year.
It would be awesome if football ran right into baseball and baseball ran right into football so there was no break between.
I don't think they would ever do that but it would be nice.
The Chief's had a pretty quiet offseason, did you follow them?
Not really, like you said, it was quiet but it is basically the same team.
Yeah, 3 general managers in 10 years though, something is going on in the front offices.
Agreed, I think Clark Hunt is involved too much in the dealings of the team.
Yeah, he is not really a football guy so he should probably just let the experts make the decisions.
For sure, he doesn't have the clout that his dad did.
Agreed, his dad basically created the league and invented the superbowl.
Yes, Clark hasn't done anything except inherit the team.
John Dorsey was a great general manager though, they will definitely miss him.
For sure, he had the inside line to a lot of trade deals and had a good relationship with the players.
Especially Jamaal Charles, do you think he will make a comeback this year?
I don't know if they resigned him but he is getting pretty old and there are 3 young running backs behind him.
Speaking of running backs, I hear Adrian Peterson and tearing it up this offseason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, did you hear about NFL deflategate?
No, what is that? I don't remember hearing anything like that. What is it again?
Remember the New England Patriot's Tom Brady? It was the 2014-2015 season.
No way? Really? How did I miss that? What happened?
Well, it was mainly in the play-offs. The Patriots were busted slightly deflating their footballs.
No way! How did that help them?
Well, it's easier to throw and catch when the ball is just slightly softer and Tom Brady liked his footballs like that.
Yeah, but wouldn't that help both teams? They both use the same ball.
Yeah, kind of, but it really worked to the Patriots and Brady's advantage.
Wow, what happened when they got busted?
It was pretty major dude. Brady got suspended for 4 games in the next season and team got fined 1 mil. The team also lost 2 of their top draft picks.
Really, but wasn't that the season they came back and won the Superbowl ....again?
Yeah, they beat the Falcons. After all that they were still the best team to win the Superbowl.
Wow, how did the Falcons make it to the Superbowl? They suck.
Yeah, they were considered the best team overall but they couldn't pull it together to beat New England in the Superbowl.
Wow, I wonder if the Falcons will be able to come back and be as good?
Probably not.
Yeah, no kidding.
Yeah, but I bet we the Patriots and Brady again!
Yeah, that dude is super human!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the top high school football player in Pennsylvania?
That's a good question.
I think it is Trent Thompson.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's got a lot of stamina and is very strong.
He can tackle anyone.
He is stacked.
I think he can mentally take on the pros.
He physically is ready as well.
With a few years in the college scene he could be the next Kyle Williams.
I bet he could.
With the right mentoring and attitude he'll go far.
Yes, he will.
I think he'd be recruited by the Eagles.
They'd love to have him.
So would the Cowboys.
He has a lot of high hopes for the future.
Sure does.
I wish him all the best.
Me too, he deserves it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the clip of that quarterback breaking his leg?
Yes. It kills me every time.
What was his name?
Joe Theisman
What team did he play for
The redskins
Oh, I should have known that.
Is RGIII still the QB for them?
No he got injured too much
Who is the QB now?
It's Kirk Cousins right now
Isn't he an older player?
He's only 28
Looks like his contract negotiations aren't going so well for this season
Yeah. his completions were only like 68 percent last year
That's pretty bleak
For sure. I'd like if they got a new QB
They need a new owner and coach and all
True. Their owner is a moron
A literal insane person with too much money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The DALLAS COWBOYS have a strong rivalry with the NEW YORK GIANTS.
Yes, ever since the 1960.
I think the Giants are better.
They were established in 1925.
They play in MetLife Stadium.
That is actually in New Jersey.
They are also headquartered in New Jersey.
They were first in the EASTERN DIVISION.
Then they were in the AMERICAN CONFERENCE.
Then they were in the EASTERN CONFERENCE.
They are now in the NFC.
Yes since 1970.
Their jersey is blue and white.
Sometimes it is read and white.
The owner is John Mara.
And also Steve Tisch is an owner.
John Mara is president of the team.
Jerry Reese is the general manager.
Head coach is Ben McAdoo.
They have good leaders.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite player in the NFL?
My favorite player is Matthew Stafford.
Really? Why?
He's a great player.
The lions aren't even that good.
That doesn't make him any less of a great player.
I'm not too sure about that.
Hes really nice, really humble.
Being humble doesn't make someone a great player.
He always puts his team first, he always gives the game his everything.
Are the lions your favorite team?
No, He's just my favorite player.
Do you have other favorite players?
Sure, I have a lot of them.
What's another one?
JJ Watt is another one of my favorites.
Why? Because he's so good?
He is really good, but he also puts his team first.
Is he also a really humble guy?
He is, he used to deliver pizzas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're a 49ers fan, right?
Sometimes, yeah. Why?
So what's the deal about Colin Kaepernick?
What do you mean?
Well Joe Montana isn't optimistic about him finding a new home.
You mean he's still a free agent? I'm a little surprised.
Some are blaming protests in 2016 for him remaining a free agent for four months now.
Well... that could be part of it. Personally I don't think he's getting a fair chance though.
How so?
Well he's either being blackballed by everyone in the NFL or they just don't want to see his play style.
So?
He's got a 59.8% career completion record. That's nearly 10% more than even Tim Tebow's career.
That is actually pretty dang impressive.
Yeah, so the guy is getting a raw deal. Hopefully someone will give him a chance he deserves.
So what do you think about that DeForest Buckner? Seems like there's a lot of hype around him lately.
And with good reason! Dude is going to be a defensive MVP this year for certain.
You really think so? Isn't he still kinda green.
He may be in his sophomore of his career but dude has the build, speed, and athleticism.
But wont their new 4-3 defense give him some issues?
Nah, dude knows his stuff and has the skill for both inside and outside on the line. Trust me, you're going to want to keep an eye on him this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Quarterback?
I like Aaron Rodgers a lot
Me too, he is probably the best in the league
I would have to agree with that, who is your favorite?
I really like Russel Wilson
Yeah he seems to be a good fit for the seahawks
I think you are right, they've found a lot of success with him over the years
I love watching him
He has a lot of good mobility
One of the fastest in the league no doubt.
I would say he's a top 5 QB in the league
Who are the others?
Rodgers, Brady, Prescott
What about the final QB?
I thinking about it...
What about Carson Wentz?
What? No way, the eagles are terrible
Well then who?
I would have to say probably Carson Palmer
Yeah, the Cardinals have been pretty good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you excited about the upcoming NFL season?
Yes I am!
I've been waiting since last year when it ended.
So have I. I've been ready for it to start every since it ended last season.
I can't wait to see how the Dallas Cowboys do this season.
Yes me too. I'm anxious to see what's going to happen.
As well as they did last year, this year should be better.
I'm hoping it is. Last year Dak Prescott did an awesome job as quarterback,
I know he really did. He was only backup quarterback and looked what happened.
I know he became the Cowboys number one quarterback.
I know and he is awesome.
He really is. He really showed Romo up.
He did he put him to shame.
Romo started out being a good quarterback but started staying injured all the time.
I know. He cost the Cowboys a lot of games too.
He really did with all those interceptions he threw.
I know. He had started looking really bad.
I know he really looked awful and was making the whole team look awful.
I think he's going to do better with ending the playing career and moving to what he is.
I think so too. He's a likable guy. His playing days were just over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Seahawks?
They are my favorite team?
Were you disappointed last year?
Yes I was
I am sorry they lost
Hey it was not as bad as the Super Bowl loss
Yeah, that was really sad
That was a great game though
Yes it was
Do you think they have a good team this year?
Yes I do
Can they win it all?
No, I doubt it
Wow, some fan you are.
I am being realistic.
That is true. Every team has a small chance.
Who do you think will win?
The Patriots
I think a lot of people think that
They are a great team
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've heard folks say the Chicago Bears will be better than expected this year.
No chance they get to eight wins this year, much less make the playoffs or anything.
Their defense is going to be a lot better.
I suppose that's true, their front seven isn't bad. That secondary, though....
Yeah, it's still bad. Better, but still bad. Vic Fangio at the helm, he may work some magic.
Even still, there's only so much they can do. Aaron Rodgers is still in that division, that's going to be two losses right there.
They always play the Packers tough, though.
I hear that every year. That secondary is still going to get torched.
Jordan Howard is still a bright spot. Quarterback isn't going to be that much worse either.
I will admit Jordan Howard could be amazing. He has to stay healthy, though. Speaking of which, is Kyle Long even going to be 100% this year?
No one knows. He never had that surgery. I still think the interior of the line is going to be fine.
Could be. Tackles still a problem. Question marks at wideout, not much talent at tight end.
What, you don't believe in Baby Gronk?
Ridiculous. Even if Shaheen is Gronk, it's going to be a couple years before he gets there. There's not going to be any consistent scoring for this team this year.
Where do you think they are going to end up? I don't see playoffs at all.
As much as I'd like to see three wins and a high draft pick, they are probably still going to win enough to fall out of the top 5 in draft order.
That would be typical, wouldn't it? Not bad enough to totally tank the season, not good enough for the playoffs, either.
That's Bears football for the past 30 years, man.
Can't argue with that. Maybe Trubisky will be a star, though.
He's going to have to be for Pace to keep his job.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I love the cowboys. What about you?
I am a Dolphins fan all the way
Dolphins play in a tough division.
Oh yeah its hard to win the division with the Patroits there
Yeah the Patroits amaze me every year
How about them Boys? Do you think Prescot has another breakout year?
I think if Elliot and run the way he did last year he will
They were a great combo last year. I could see them running the table again this year
Yeah I think they brought some life back to the cowboys fans
Yeah I was hoping they could go all the way after my team was out lol
Miami is a stong team and I think they are going to be even stronger this year. They picked up some talent this year
Yeah but they always seem to make good moves and play good durring most of the season. But they can never win the games they need too
Yeah I know what you mean. The games that count
Excatly the ones that matter most
Do we play you guys this year?
Im not sure I havent looked at the schedule yet
If so I think we take it
It would be a good game for sure
No doubt I would like to see it
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are the Patriots looking for the fall?
Pretty good! Tom Brady is obviously the best.
I don't know about that. The Oakland Raiders look pretty good!
I don't know a lot about the Raiders. Are you a fan?
Yep! I grew up in Oakland and I have been to a few games.
That is awesome. Who are their best players?
Derek Carr is their quarterback. Have you heard of him?
I don't think so. Where did he play in college?
He played at Fresno State and was drafted in 2014.
Oh wait, does his brother play in the NFL?
Yeah! His brother, David Carr, used to play for the Giants.
That's right! He was pretty good I think.
He was pretty good. I think he was with the Giants when they won the Super Bowl in 2011.
They sound like a very athletic family. How are the Giants looking for next year?
I don't really know. I only know they have Eli Manning.
Yeah, I don't know much about them either.
They are certainly better than the New York Jets though.
Oh definitely. What was their record last year?
I think it was 11-5, the same as the Steelers.
Yes, the Steelers were 11-5 last yer as well. We will see how the season goes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe the NFL season is just two months away ?
I know, I can't wait
How's your team look this year ?
I'm a Cowboy fan , and I think we win it all this year
Cowboys look good , but I am a Viking fan and I think we might have something to say about who gets to Minneapolis
That's right, the Super bowl is in Minnesota this year isn't it
Yeah, and that makes it the perfect year for the Vikings to return to the Super bowl
How long has it been?
Forty years !
That's a long dry spell, but I'm afraid it doesn't end this year because the Cowboys will be there
Who do you think makes it from the AFC?
Probably New England again. How about you?
I think Pittsburgh is the team to beat and would make a good opponent for the Vikings
You mean for the Cowboys
Really, it's pretty wide open in the NFC.
Yeah, the Falcons and Packers should both be tough again
And the Saints could be unstoppable if AP comes back to form
Really a lot of teams have a decent shot
But I hope it ends up with the Vikings and Cowboys in the NFC championship, and it easily could.
If it does, it's big bet time for you and me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the playoffs last year?
I do every year
What did you think about them?
I was surprised at the performance of the Atlanta Hawks
Yeah, they were one of the best teams in the league
They totally destroyed my team
Which one is that?
The greenbay packers
Oh yes I remember that game. That was devastating to watch.
Yeah and it pissed me off a lot.
I would've definitely though that the Packers would have done better
I think every would have thought that
The only way they were able to actually score points was because they let them at the end
They could have easily shut them out
Green Bay had one of the best offenses in the league too
And they were only able to score 14 points
At least they lost in a heatbreaking way to the patriots in the superbowl
Yeah they did lose the most important game
How do you feel about that?
It makes me feel a whole lot better
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo
Hey
What are you up to
Nothing much
Well why not
Gonna watch some foot ball
What game
Browns
Ouch..
Why ouch
Come on
No?
You know how bad the browns are
They are not that bad
Yes they are
The lions are worse
And?
So they aren't bad by comparison
How about the steelers
Well no not as good
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL is a very unique sports organization.
Why is that?
The way money works is different in the NFL
What do you mean?
The NBA and MLB, and other sports organizations have strict rules and guidelines.
That sounds obvious doesn't the NFL have that?
Actually. All of the NFL decisions are made by a board of trustees, and all money in the NFL goes to preserving this organization.
So it's like a private company in a sense.
Exactly.
So how does that make the NFL different from a viewer standpoint?
Not sure. I bet the commercials and major decisions are decided by the board
I wonder what that does to the company.
Since everything is discussed in the board room, the vision of the company is probably always prioritized.
So football is the socialist guy among other pro sports.
Haha you could say that.
The NFL is probably a pretty rich comapny.
They'll do anything to prevent being taken down.
This kind of makes me not want to watch football anymore.
You should look into the NFL more. Check out this website.
Interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Texas football teams
I think by far the cowboys are the best
Everyone would agree with that I think
The Texans lack key elements of their team
They have basically no quarterback
Yeah they had a chance to pick up a couple good free agents but they let it slip
I feel bad for them, but it ultimately came down to poor leadership
Yeah, I feel bad for those fans
Dak Prescott on the Cowboys is extremely good
Yeah, him and Ezekiel Elliot are both really good
I think they have a really good chance to go the distance next year
Yeah and I bet they will get close
They were eliminated by my favorite team, the Packers
That was a great game
Are you a packer fan too?
Yes I love the packers as well
Well then I hope the cowboys lose again to them next year.
I think we will have some luck in that
Although the cowboys are young, they may develop into a really great team
Only time will tell!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the NFL should favor expansion?
Absolutely not.
I'm leaning that way, but not as strongly. Why?
NFL teams are a massive burden on the cities.
How?
They use taxpayer money to build the stadiums, but the taxpayers have no say in how the team is run.
You think it would be better if the city could vote out staff?
That's an insane amount of power and I'd love to have it. Fire coaches after bad seasons.
I like expansion but am cautious.
Why?
Over-saturation. We don't need a ton of teams, and there are already enough
Plus, that would then make team quality go down overall.
Maybe. The Texans went from nothing to pretty good after just a few years.
But they're the only ones in the past 20 years or so for that to happen to.
I'd be fine with them moving to a big city in the Midwest.
There's a slight problem with that.
What's that?
In the Midwest, the cities aren't actually that big, and fans would have to travel great distances to get there.
They're devoted!
Yeah, but now you have people driving 200 miles after five beers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hester is the best return man ever
nope
who then
deion sanders
no way
prime time
not the best
neon deion
maybe the best nicknames
could change the game in an instant
hester can too
not like prime time
how so
prime time had to put no effort into it
hester does
yup
you're crazy
dont foget
what
prime time actually played other postions too
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for the NFL this year?
Yeah! i can't wait.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Saints.
Oh. I'm a Giants fan. The Peterson signing was interesting
Yeah, he is a bit old, but I think he has something left in the tank
Brees still looked good last year too.
Yup. Just got to get the defense working a bit. How do you feel about your Giants?
Not too good. Still have Eli Manning...
True haha. He is a turnover machine
At least Coughlin is gone
I really like watching Odell Beckham
Yeah, he is the best WR. Who do you like to win it all?
I like the Patriots.
Yeah me too
I worry about Brady's age, but I havent seen any signs of falling off
Belicheck is a legit genuis
Yeah it is insane
Im just glad the Saints arent in the same division as them!!
Yeah, being a Giants fan can be difficult because of that
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the San Francisco 49ers?
They have been awful since they lost that Super Bowl a few years back.
That they have, but do you think their new coach is going to do better or worse than the last one?
I don't think you can do much worse than Chip Kelly did last season.
Speaking of Chip Kelly, you remember how he made the Eagles good for two seasons then destroyed the roster.
Yeah that was brutal if you are an Eagles fan to see all those players go.
Back to the 49ers, you think Brian Hoyer has a shot at winning some games?
I doubt it, he always gets hurt no matter how productive he is for a few games.
Who would take his place if he gets hurt?
I would think CJ Bethard the rookie from Iowa would take over.
Bethard was decent in college if I remember correctly.
Yeah not too bad in the Big Ten, he did lead the Hawkeyes to an undefeated season.
Well it will be interesting to see how their QB situation plays out.
That is a definite weak point for that team, plus no one knows how Carlos Hyde the RB will be this year after injury.
I forgot he got hurt at the end of the season.
Yeah I had him in fantasy, only plus is that his injury didn't require surgery
Didn't they pick up a RB in free agency also?
They got Tim Hightower who played good for the Saints last year.
He may have a decent role in the offense then, especially if Hyde isn't fully recovered.
That is probably true but both have similar power run styles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for football this year?
I'm always excited for football.
I hope Matt Ryan comes back and wins it this year.
That would be cool to see. It's very possible too.
He's so good with making completions.
Yeah, his pass accuracy is crazy.
I have never seen anything like it.
I hope the Giants do better this year, too.
Yeah, I don't see that happening.
I really don't either. Their draft strategy was inconsistent to say the least.
I can't believe they went for the first round pick tight end.
Yeah, how much could that possibly contribute?
I agree. Evan Engram is good but he's just a tight end.
Although, I feel like teams can't always make the huge, game-changing draft picks.
True. Not everyone is a quarterback.
Still, I think it was a weak pick. There have to be better options.
I would say they definitely fell a couple ranks due to their drafting process.
I still hope they do well, though. I love the Giants.
Don't feel bad. I'm truly a Jets fan.
Yikes. Yeah, they're not looking too strong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Giants owner, Wellington Mara subscribed to newspaper from all over the country, looking for new upcoming talents.
Oh, right. He even drove around meeting the players
Yep. That was in late 30s
Long time ago. You know how the scouts began?
Yes. LA rams owner hired a bunch of people to read the newspapers and drive around recruiting new players
The modern day scouting began. That was in 1946.
Eddie Kotal, Packer's tailback.
The very first full time professional football scout.
They've put together a team that won NFL championships in 45, 49, 50, and 51
In the AFL began and NFL lost the monopoly over the players.
And the raids between the leagues began. It was a messy period.
They actually kidnapped players and held the draftees in hotels to keep them  from the other league
The merger was all but necessary.
You know how theykept the records back in those days?
No, how?
in 1963, the Lions, Eagles, Steelers talent organization was formed, LESTO as they called it
Oh yeah the BLESTO, once Bears joined them
yeah, And Jack Butler compiled a huge report from dozens of scouts, and distributed the report cards on the players.
Then the combines began?
Yep, the reports weren't giving goo enough info, so the National, Blesto, and Quadra which were all similar report agencies, started organizing combine events
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the NFL have a division in Europe?
Yes, it had a league in Europe from 1991 to 2007.
What was the name of this league?
They kept changing it!
What were the names they used?
They called it the World League of American Football, the World League, NFL Europe League, NFL Europe and NFL Europa.
Wow, that's a lot of different names!
I told you!
Did any famous players play there?
Sure, there were some guys who played there and in the NFL.
Like who?
John Kitna, the former NFL quarterback.
Yes, I remember him. He played for the Bengals for awhile.
Yes, and he also played for the Barcelona Dragons.
Who else?
David Akers, the former kicker for the Eagles.
Where did he play?
He played for the Berlin Thunder.
Any Steelers?
Sure, James Harrison played for the Rhein Fire. They were based in Dusseldorf, Germany.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the draft for the NFC east teams?
It was interesting what some teams did.
The Cowboys went heavy on the defense.
Yes,they needed help.
I still think they're defense isn't going to be good enough.
They're not too deep.
Going to take a hit losing Damien Wilson too.
That's right he was arrested for domestic violence.
Yes,another cowboy arrested.
How about the Giants picking a tight end.
Yea,I never heard of the guy.
I never did either.
Wasn't it Evan engram from Mississippi?
Yes,he's very athletic from what I read.
Not your typical tight end.
The Cowboys needed help on the edge but went with a run stopper on the defensive line.
Right,taco charlton.
I can hear the nicknames now.
Oh they'll be a lot of Taco Bell references.
Probably be an endorsement.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the raiders will be as good as they showed last year?
If Derek Carr can bounce back from his injury,yes I do.
He broke his leg right?
Yes,he broke his fibula.
That's a severe injury.
Yes it is.
Didn't they get marshawn lynch?
Yes they did.
Yes they did.
That's a big addition.
They also have amari cooper and Michael Crabtree.
I don't think offense is a problem.
No,but defense might be.
They addressed the secondary heavily though.
Right,and the rookie Eddie vanderdoes could be a good defensive tackle.
He should bolster the defensive line.
They are still weak at linebacker.
They could use help there.
Fox has them winning over 9.5 games.
I can see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi there
What's up
Nothing much
Cool
Gotta question
Sure thing
Well what type of team do you prefer in the NFL
What do you mean
Between offense and defense
Oh that's easy
Is it?
Yeah
I am conflicted
Well for me it's simple both
Both?
Yes an even mix between them
Makes sense
Not hard to figure out
I can see the benefits
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Yes I do.
Who is your favorite team?
The Cleveland Browns.
That is my favorite team too.
Great, how do you think they will do this year.
They will stink as usual.
Yeah pretty much how I feel too.
Do you go to many games?
I have season tickets.
I do too.
I sit in the dawg pound.
That's the best place to sit.
Yeah only the die hard fans are there.
It's to bad they are bad every year.
I just wish we could find a quarterback.
I hope this years draft class actually works out.
Yeah that would be a change.
It was good talking to you.
Go Browns!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have we seen the last of a dominant starting running back that can handle 30 carries a game?
No I think its cyclical and right now the league is a passing league.
And what lends itself to that belief?
The rules are set up to favor it
Why do you think that is?
The rules regarding pass interferece
OH ok i see your persepective.
They really need to adjust them
How about the catch rule
They screwed the Cowboys on that call
I think thats the first one that needs to be fixed.
I just wish you could be physical like you used to
You can thank those same guys for the reason that it isnt
Why?
They ended up suing the league
Yeah well they deserved it
The league?
Yeah they exploited these guys
They could have warned them against the perils of football? Is that your sentiment
Yes and they should have had these guys sign waivers that they wouldnt pull these stunts
XXXXXXXXXXX
Has football season started?
i don't know...which is weird...
so are you a cowboys fan?
hell, yeah!
Do you feel sorry for Tony?
A little bit
It must be hard knowing that you've aged out ..
Well, he's rich if that helps any...
I saw that interview he did about Dax
I thought he showed a lot of class, but I wonder if that's how he really feels
I'm pretty sure that's how the cowboys fans feel
Why do you say that?
Their record last season improved when Tony got injured and stayed out for so long and...
right, when Dax came in and took over
but they still didn't get anywhere that mattered
i think this seasons will be the cowboys season for sure
why?
because they don't have to watch Romo break another collarbone
And then there's the issue of Romo actually coaching the team from the sidelines
yep, there's that. i wonder if he gets extra for doing that
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think I'm going to watch a few games in the superdome this season
Oh yeah, I don't like indoor stadiums that much.
It is a little odd but it's fun how loud it gets.
Don't you hate that the seahawks stole the 12th man slogan
Ugh yes. That totally originated in New Orleans
I hate everything about the Seahawks and their bandwagon fans
Me too. Without Marshawn Lynch they are nothing
I do like Russel Wilson though
Yeah he's a solid QB
Who's your favorite NFL QB?
Right now it's probably Cam Newton
He's good. I'm into Aaron Rodgers.
I wish the Packers could win a superbowl
I know. They get so close every year.
How far did they get last year?
They lost to the vikings in regular season
How did the vikings end up doing?
They lost to the Seahawks
That's a bummer
Yeah. They still went 11-5 though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go to any of the Rams home games this year with me?
I would love to go to a Rams game.
Great, which game do you prefer to go to?
Definitely a game against the Seahawks.
Oh, that should be good, but it will probably be a blowout win for the Seahawks.
Yes, they are a much better team than the Rams are right now.
I think a game versus the 49ers would be close though.
Yes, but I want to at least see a potential Superbowl team play.
I understand, so Rams versus Seahawks it is.
Yes, we just need to make sure we are both available that day.
Yeah, we could also go tailgate and invite some others.
That sounds like a lot of fun.
It will be, the last time we tailgated before a game it was amazing.
I wish I went that time, but I had to work.
No worries, this time we'll have you around.
By the way are you planning to go to multiple games this season?
Maybe, I want to go to the game against the Cardinals too.
Right, that could be a good game.
Yes, but mainly because my wife is a Cardinals fan.
Oh, well it's cool she's interested in going to a game as well, my wife doesn't like going to games that much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
All I know is that I am expecting a great year for football.
Yea, there should be lots of excitement.
I agree. Lots of teams could really make some noise.
Yea, what do you think about the Steelers?
They really have a team, but they can't seem to get over the hump.
Yea, well they always get so far, but never far enough.
Yea, it seems like they stop short every year.
Yea, they do, but the definitely have some playmakers. They should win.
Yea, as long as those playmakers can actually stay on the field.
Yea, Bell sure has a hard time doing that it seems.
Yea, they have a strong passing game though and they are really good.
Yea, Big Ben has always been a talent when he is on the field.
Yea, when he is on the field is an accurate statement. He has to prove that he can be more.
Yea, well he takes a lot of hits.
Yea, they have to do a better job of protecting him. Thats for sure.
I agree! Thats something that they have been unable to do.
Yea, they have. Its tough to win without protecting the quarterback.
Yea, well if they can start to do that, they can win.
Yea, that is really important.
I agree, but they still may not be better than the Patriots.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am ready to watch some football
Me too. Love the NFL.
Do you think some of the players are rough.
Yeah i think some of the players are a little too rough.
Yeah they should get penalized.
Some do and they get fined.
Yeah some are harsh fines too.
I think that is right but everyone should be treated the same.
I agree. Some do not get fined at all.
Sometimes they are so rough someone could get hurt.
I have seen that.
It gets scary.
Yeah you never know how bad it can get.
Someone could get a bad concussion.
Some get paralyzed.
It is scary and some should be careful.
Yes that is why I think they should have more firm rules.
I agree it could take someones life.
Let alone their career.
Maybe one day they will stop being so rough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that game between the Chicago Bears and the Houston Texans?
Yes, Chicago fell apart in that second half.
I know, they didn't even score a field goal.
Yep, the Texans' defense was smothering.
How many times did Jay Cutler get sacked?
I believe it was about five times.
Do you know how many passing yards Osweiler had?
Osweiler had 231 passing yards.
What about Jay Cutler. How many yards did he have?
He had about 216 so it wasn't too far from Osweiler.
What was Jay Cutler's QB rating?
His QB rating was not good. It was only 51.3.
What was Osweiler's QB rating?
Osweiler's QB rating was better than Cutler's at 78.5.
Do you know who led the Texans in rushing?
Lamar Miller had 106 rushing yards.
Who was Chicago's leading rush man?
Chicago was led by Jeremy Langford with 57 rushing yards.
Okay, thanks. This season is turning out to be very interesting.
I agree. It will be interesting to see how the rest of the season plays out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to watch more sports this year. I think it will bring me closer to my boyfriend.
What type of sports do you like?
I like to watch gymnastics and table-tennis.
Are these the sports he likes?
Unfortunately no. He really only watches football but I have never liked football.
You should give it a try, you may be surprised. I didn't like it much either when I was young.
What changed your mind?
I think I just didn't like it because I didn't know the rules! It just seemed that they were starting and stopping constantly and it made me feel impatient and annoyed.
That's exactly how I feel! I don't know the rules at all!
I can teach you the rules. It's not hard at all.
Thank you so much. I can't wait!
No problem. In fact if you'd like we can go to a Steelers came when the season starts. My cousin is usually able to get me tickets.
Oh, NFL football doesn't happen all year round?
No, there are seasons. The season starts in September and end with Superbowl.
Superbowl is usually in February right?
Yes! How did you know that ?
My boyfriend made me watch it with him and his friends the past couple of years.
I'm sure you had no idea going on, but at least you may have enjoyed the halftime shows
I did! Do all NFL games have great performers like that?
Not big celebrities like the Superbowl would, no. Usually just a local singer, a marching band, and cheerleaders dancing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So it looks like Raymond James Stadium is not going to raise ticket sales.
Well, since the Bucs cant get to the playoffs i can see why. Sales have to be down.
I remember a few years back they tried to raise ticket sales and black out games.
I do too and the Bucs were playing worse then they are now!
I think they will have to make it to the playoffs to see some kind of jump in attendance.
Plus it so costly to buy anything there.
True. Also they are screening anyone that comes in like you are at the airport, no sneaking in anything!
Yup. If you want a coke be prepared to pay 5$ for a 24 oz cup.
And it will be packed full of ice too.
Same with beer. Way too overpriced.
Hopefully this will be the year the Bucs get to the playoffs and beyond.
Yes, i don't think the prices will feel so bad if the team is having a winning season.
I wonder if New England has that problem at Foxborough.
I don't know, i havent been there in years
Me either.
I know when i am at the Trop, the food and drinks are good and not that expensive.
I guess that why i like just watching NFL games at home, cheaper and better view.
I know! Speaking of which, you gonna have a Bucs party this year?
You know it!
Right on! I cant wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
It's terrible!
I know. I wish they were less nomadic.
Me too.
It will be good, however, to have a team in Las Vegas.
Yes, I can't wait to catch a game while I'm there for business.
When's the stadium opening?
Las Vegas Stadium, the home of the Raiders, should be ready by 2020.
Wow, that's a long wait.
Yes, but it will be worth it.
True, but what should we do until then?
I think we should support the team.
Is the team more important than the location?
I think so. The Raiderss are famous for being tough irrespective of their location.
You think that toughness comes from the owners?
Yes, all owners choose values for their business.
And, the Raiders most value toughness?
I think so. But, they are also famous for being wild.
They try to live up to their name?
Yes, and they strive to live up to their logo -- football helmet-wearing pirate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so disappointed in Donovan Metts.
Why?
He keeps fumbling!
Dang.
Every time he goes for the ball, he slips.
What's his problem?
He has legal issues at home.
And?
They say it's affecting his game.
That's messed up.
He's gotta shape up soon.
Do you think he will?
Maybe if he solves his legal woes.
Or maybe he's just a bad player!
I'm trying to avoid that notion.
Why?
He used to be on my top list.
Oh ok.
Now he's in a sunken place.
Unfortunately.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL football on the holidays?
I watch every Thanksgiving.
Do you look forward to the Cowboys or the Lions playing more?
I look forward to the Cowboys game more but I watch both.
They added a third game in 2006.
I know the third game teams are random each year.
I love eating turkey and watching football.
During half time of the NFL games my family and I play football outside
Bet you don't get paid like the NFL players.
Nope! We have a good time though imagining we are scoring touchdowns.
I love how the teams wear throwback jerseys during Thanksgiving games.
That is pretty nostalgic.
Do you ever think they will replace the Lions or Cowboys with different Thanksgiving teams?
I doubt it. The tradition is too strong at this point.
They have tried and failed in the past.
I think it helps now that they offer a third Thanksgiving Day game.
Good point. The other teams are less likely to complain.
Those poor guys have to play instead of eating turkey.
They get paid millions. I am sure they don't mind being a little late to Thanksgiving dinner.
I bet they work up an appetite playing football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?
You know it?
Who you placing your money on this year?
The Cowboys.
Are you serious?
Yeah, why?
The team is just, not so good.
They just have to pull together like any other team. Look they have some really good players.
Like who? Don't say Dez Bryant, who I think is over paid.
That maybe so, but the man is a good wide receiver.
Please, he played in 13 games last year and his defensive game was not so hot.
I'll give you that, But I wasn't banking on him, Ezekiel Elliott.
Ok, I think the "Zeke" has a lot of potential.
Yes. He is an awesome running back.
Like I said, "he has potential."
Ok, listen. In 2016 he was the starting running back; ahead of veterans Alfred Morris and Darren McFadden.
So, what are you trying to say?
That Zeke got game, and the coach knows real talent.
Well, I'll make sure to keep an eye out for him this year.
You already know, I'll be infront of the tv.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You watch Football, right?
I follow the Ravens and Eagles, but that's about it.
But you watch the Superbowl no matter what, right?
Oh, of course.
What did you think of this years Superbowl?
Extremely disappointing at first, but then WOW.
That's exactly how I felt.
So you wanted the Pats to win?
Yeah, definitely.
I remember turning the game off maybe like 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter because I thought it was over.
I didn't turn it off until the end of the 3rd.
Did you turn it back on eventually or find out what happened afterwards?
I was following on Twitter. When the Pats looked like they were coming back, I watched again.
Same here. It was probably one of the best comebacks ever.
Definitely was. Tom Brady is the best of all time.
I wouldn't go that far, but he is one of the best.
Do you think they'll make the superbowl again this year?
Even though I'm more of a Ravens fan, I hope they do just to see the reaction to Brady getting another ring.
He's like 41, that would be amazing.
He is amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You pumped for the Eagles this season?
Yeah! This is Carson Wentz's year!
Now that he has Alshon Jefferey as a target, he will be so much better.
Also having a deep threat like Torrey Smith will help
Nelson Agalhor has looked good in workouts too.
I know, but I need to see more from him before I believe it.
I don't think he will ever be more than a slot option, but I am just hoping he won't be a first round bust forever
We can hope. We are Philly fans after all.
What do you think the Cowboys will do?
Ah, I think Dak Prescott is due for a regression.
Me too. I think it'll be the Birds and the Boys fighting for the East
As much as I hate to say it, don't sleep on the Giants.
Why you say that?
Their defense, man. That is a sick unit that will keep them in games all year.
That's true, but I hate them so much.
At leas they beat the Pats a couple of times.
I know. They broke up the perfect season. At least there's that
Couldn't have happened to a better bunch. Those Pats are cheaters.
Totally with you! Bellicheck is a great coach but a horrible dude.
Tom Brady is a tool too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the Rams moving back to LA?
I am strongly against it, I think they NFL should have just created a new team for LA and one for Las Vegas.
Yeah, did you see they fired Jeff Fisher last week?
He is great coach, but he was giving a terrible team to try to win with, and it just could not be done.
Speaking of Las Vegas, I guess you seen the Raiders are moving there in the next few years.
Now Vegas is going to have the NFL and the NHL.
Are there enough core people that live in Vegas to support two pro teams.
I have no idea, I thought most of the population there was tourists.
I wonder who is going to be the team to beat this year in the NFL.
Probably the Patriots, like always, and their cheating ways.
Probably so, but Dallas made a strong showing this past year.
That rookie quarter back and the rookie running back for Dallas are great additions.
I wonder if we have heard the last of Kapernack and his refusing to stand for the national anthem.
Well, with his team that won I think four games last season, I am  not sure why we heard about him at all.
Yeah, the 49'ers were terrible last year, almost as bad as the Rams.
I am really pulling for Green Bay to have a strong year.
Yea, Aaron Rodger didn't have the greatest of years this past year, but he is still a great quarterback.
Cam Newton is also great, but how his team went from a superbowl appearance one year to a losing season the next is beyond me.
I think they lost a lot of their core players and some were injured.
Well, hopefully someone can step up and knock the Pats off their pedestal this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch that ESPN: 30 for 30 on the 1985 Chicago Bears?
I caught the tail end of it the other night but didn't get to watch the entire thing.
You need to watch it as soon as possible.
Really? Was that good? I'm a sucker for anything football and love the Bears.
Yes! It was very good. It had a lot of great Walter Payton footage.
Walter Payton is one of my all time favorite NFL players. Rest in piece sweetness.
Mine too, I get pretty emotional even thinking about him and everything he went through.
What kind of cancer did he have again?
It was a rare liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Damn what a horrible way to go. Do you know when Emmitt Smith broke his rushing record?
Emmitt Smith broke the record in 2002, I think he had like 17,162 career rushing yards when he broke it.
That's amazing. I miss old football like that now running backs are becoming pretty obselte.
Same but you have to understand that game is steadily changing and has been for years now.
Do you think that has to do with the different rules that have been applied to the game?
No not really. I would say it has to do more with the players. Players are getting bigger and stronger. Also just the way teams are running their offenses now.
Makes a lot of sense now that I'm really thinking about it. What modern player would you compare Walter Payton to?
This is going to be tough but I think I'm going to have to go with maybe Marshawn Lynch or Darren Sproles.
Mashawn Lynch is a complete monster.
Well his nickname is "Beast Mode". I'm exicited that he came out of retirement.
Same but I think everybody knew he wasnt serious about retiring to begin with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your team?
Minnesota baby, all day
How did they do last year?
8-8. They missed Teddy Bridgewater
Think the Vikings will be any good this year?
If Dalvin Cook is any good, yes
ISam Bradfor has to be good to
He threw only 20 tds last year. That's way too low
Yup. They had no running game to speak of
Who was their leading reciever?
Theilen. he had 5 tds
Yeah that is way too low
You can almost go to sleep watching their games last year
Wow, that's cold...but true
They should win nine games this year, right?
More like seven. their schedule is a beast
Who do they play?
Steeler, Falcons and Green Bay twice. That's five losses right there
Wow that is tough
That's why they need Teddy
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dad, what is the NFL?
Well son the NFL is the National Football League.
Who plays in the NFL?
Professional football players. After college players get drafted by the NFL teams to play professionally.
How many teams are in the NFL?
There are 32 teams in the NFL.
Do they play 32 games a season?
No they play 16 regular season games and more if they make the playoffs.
Can we go to a game Dad?
Of course. We will go see the Tampa Bay Buccaneers play.
Are they a good team?
They have really good players this season.
Who is their quarterback?
Jameis Winston is there quarterback.
How much money do NFL players make?
They can make millions of dollars. Even the lowest players make $250K.
That is a lot of money!
Yes it is. Some players even get endorsements and make money doing commercials.
Like Peyton Manning?
Yes, Peyton Manning retired but still has endorsements and makes lots of money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how do you think the Seahawks will do this year?
I don't know - I had so much hope last year but the season really disappointed.
Why do you say last season was a disappointment?
Well, they just lost too many games, haha.
Why do you think they lost so much?
The Seahawks' offense just wasn't getting the job done.
Do you think they have improved their offense for this season?
That remains to be seen - hopefully they've made some improvements.
What kind of improvements would be the most helpful?
Well, some people say that Seahawks' quarterback didn't perform up to his capabilities.
Why would they say that?
Well, the quarterback is the backbone of the offence, and the team was seen as simply not scoring enough.
But lack of scoring isn't all the quarterback's fault, is it?
No, not entirely, but he is the easiest to blame, haha.
Did you go to any Seahawks games last year?
No, I prefer to watch the games on TV.
You watch the games at home?
I will watch them at home, or sometimes at a bar when I feel like getting out.
Do you consider yourself a Seahawks fan?
Only when they are winning, haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who won the most recent Super Bowl?
Are you kidding me?
No, do you?
Of course I do! It was the Patriots. They came back from 25 down over Atlanta.
Oh, that's right. It was all over the news at the time.
Exactly. How could you not remember?
Well, I don't follow the NFL that closely.
Oh, I do. I'm a huge fan.
Of any particular team or in general?
Well, I'm actually a fan of the Patriots, but I like the game in general.
No wonder you remember the Super Bowl!
Being a Patriots fan helps, sure, but it was also a historic game.
How so?
Because in the Super Bowl no other team had been down more than ten points and won.
Oh wow, and they were down 25?
Yes, and in the third quarter.
Ok, I guess that is impressive.
It was quite the game to watch.
I usually only watch for the half time show and commercials.
As a football fan, and a Patriots fan, that just hurts!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It seems as if the last NFL season just flew by. Don't you think?
I absolutely agree. But it quite enjoyable.
Are you looking forward to this year's season?
Most definitely. I love all things football!
Same here. Will you be following this year's draft?
I follow here and there using my NFL app like most people do.
Same here. Although, I am not a huge follower of the draft.
I don't go crazy over it. I just look at my app and see who went were.
Would you consider enough a huge NFL fan?
I love football, as a sport in general. I used to play and my dream was to one day become a NFL player.
Sorry to hear that did not work out for you but there is still a chance.
Never say never. I train real hard at the gym but I think that ship has sailed.
What time would you want to play for?
Being from CO, I would love to play for the Broncos, of course.
That is actually one of my favorite teams.
No kidding? They have a very impressive defense.
They sure do, although, it seemed like this past season their offense was lacking a bit.
I noticed that, too.
That being said, that does not change the fact that they were the 2016 SuperBowl champs!
Sure doesn't! That was a great night.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football
No, I hate sports
Yeah, me too and I don't know much about it
Me either
I have been interested to see how politicized sports are gettig now
I know what you mean
Like the Kapernick thing
Yes, that was really disgusting
I know, you would think these millionaires could show some gratitude to the nation
I also hate the LGBT pushing
I agree, it is really not something sports fans like
I know a lot of people who just quit watching
And now they are pushing to take down name of Confederate Generals in Florida streets
Just play ball
Exactly
I think a lot of people are really turning against sports
I agree
I mean, we don't want a social agenda pushed
Especially not a gay one
That's true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the 2018 Super Bowl?
The Patriots are the favorite right now before the season.
Do you think they will be able to repeat?
It's hard to say.  The NFL anything can happen.
I think the Falcons will win it this year.
It's hard to make win after taking such a brutal lose last year in the Super Bowl.
I think that lose will motivate them this year.
Maybe, but rarely does the losing Super Bowl team make it back.
The Buffalo Bills did.
Yeah, but the Bills also lost 4 straight Super Bowls.
What about the Carolina Panthers?
What about them?
Do you think this is the year they win the Super Bowl?
Highly doubt it.  They have a good team but I don't know about Cam Newton.
What don't you like about Cam Newton?
I don't know if is good enough a leader yet to get them back to the Super Bowl.
He got them their 2 years ago.
Yeah, but they also weren't very good last year.
So your going with the Patriots to win it this year?
If I was betting money, the Patriots are who I would bet on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Raiders?
Yes
Did you see them in the Super Bowl?
Yes
Did you like it?
I loved it
But, they lost
I don't care
You are an interesting fan
It was very memorable
They got blown out by the Buccaneers
It was a really good game
I didn't expect it to be so one sided
I did
Really?
Tampa Bay had too good of an offense
I thought they were known for defense?
They were
You have a different point of view
I do. I love the Raiders.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are the Chicago Bears looking for this upcoming season?
I think the Bears are looking pretty bad!
You don't believe in Mitch Trubisky?
I haven't seen him play a game yet! I've just watched the college highlights but I'm not sold on him being much of an improvement for the Bears.
Anything at this point has to be better then Jay Cutler right?
Jay Cutler gets a bad reputation from all the media news but he's been solid quarterback for the Bears.
He's been terrible! I know you're a Bears fan but you have to admit he's one of the worse quarterbacks in the league the past years.
I know the public perception of him has been bad and the Bears record has been awful but people forget we play in a tough division.
I'll give you the Green Bay Packers as being tough and the Minnesota Vikings when Adrian Peterson was there, even the Detroit Lions as a tough opponent but it's not like the NFC East.
That's ridiculous! You know the NFC Central is probably the most competitive division in the NFL with all the teams always playing tough against each other.
I think that would go to the AFC Central or the NFC South. The NFC Central has been pretty much dominated by the Green Bay Packers.
The Lions gave the Packers a good run last year and they're looking better this season too. Matt Stafford is a legitimate Pro Bowl quarterback.
Do you think the Lions have a shot of winning the NFC Central?
I seriously do think they have a good chance. The Packers looked vulnerable last year and you never know about Aaron Rodgers health especially with that weak offensive line he has.
Okay, but I still don't see the Bear challenging any of those teams with your current roster.
The Bears' roster is young but I think they're going to surprise a lot of people. These guys are good players.
I don't think there's enough talent or experience for them to compete much this year. Didn't you also lose Alshon Jeffery?
Yes we lost him to the Philadelphia Eagles. He signed this off season with them, but it's all about Cameron Meredith now.
Oh that's right, Meredith is looking promising and at least Mitch gives you some hope now that Cutler has retired.
I'm hopeful for the upcoming season and I'm a little sad to see Jay Cutler retire. The pressure definitely got to him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see fox sports over under predictions for NFL teams this year?
Do you mean wins and losses?
Yes. They put a win total up and predict if the team will win more or less.
I haven't seen it yet.
They have the falcons going under ten wins.
Wow that's surprising.
I thought so too.
What do they have New England doing?
They have them going over 11 wins.
That's a good possibility.
How about the Cowboys?
They have them going over 9.5 wins.
That's a tough division.
Yes. They have the Giants going over 9 wins.
The Giants could have a big year.
Their defense is great!
It should be even better.
Yes it should be.
They have to protect Eli.
Yes they do
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the hard cap in the NFL has helped the NFL.
No doubt. Look at it's popularity.
It may be popular no matter what the cap situation is. Football in the United States is that popular.
That could be true. However, I think the growth of the NFL and the uncertainty really keeps everyone's interest.
Partly true, I suppose. Most every team comes into the season with some hope.
Except for maybe the Browns and Bills fans.
Ha ha. Yeah. Well, most everyone.
Another point with the cap. I think that the cap has also helped the balance of team worth and team revenue for all 32 teams.
How so?
I think every NFL team is worth at least a billion dollars.
Don't you think it's held back some franchises from becoming even more valuable.
No doubt. I think if there wasn't a cap, teams like the Cowboys would probably be worth billions more than they already are worth.
I was thinking of them when I was asking.
However, I don't feel sorry for Jerry Jones. His franchise is worth plenty with the salary cap rules in place.
Yeah, I would love to have his billions.
Wouldn't we all. It's really helped the smaller franchises like the Vikings gain their worth.
How much are the Vikings worth?
I think every team is worth at least a billion dollars now. Last time I looked the Vikings were valued at 800 million, and that was 5 to 6 years ago.
Yeah, I would have to figure they are over a billion dollars now.
I'm thinking the same thing. The Jaguars probably are now the least valuable franchise since the Vikings got their stadium issues figured out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team?
I have always been a big Steelers fan.
That's awesome. I like the Steelers, too.
I also really enjoy the Giants.
The Giants are fun to watch with Odell Beckham Jr.
Yeah, he has to be one of the best wide receivers in the entire league.
I agree there. I think he might be the strongest player on the team.
Yeah, it's a shame the rest of their team doesn't play on his level.
He also accepts a pretty low amount of money to play for them.
I saw that. He doesn't get comparable pay to other receivers of his caliber.
Which is strange because, like you sad, he's probably one of the best in the league.
I really only think he's beaten out by Antonio Brown.
Antonio brown is inhuman. The Steelers are going to be strong this year.
Yeah, I'm really excited about that.
Me too. It would be good to see them go far into the playoffs.
I would be buying some game tickets if that happened.
You're telling me. Another good receiver I was thinking of is Julio Jones.
I forgot about him. He's really impressive, also.
I'd say he's right up there with Odell Beckham Jr.
I agree. He might even prove to be better this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready for some football?
Heck ya when does it start?
Training camp is in a couple of months
I cant wait, seems like forever
I know, but shouldnt be here in too long
I especially cant wait for fantasy football
Me too I cant wait to beat you
Keep dreaming man Im the champ
Not for long
What do you think the steelers will do?
I think they will have a good year
Ben is coming back that is good
He does that every year I had no doubt
Think Le'veon will stay healthy this year
Ya i hope so hes our rock
AB is also a monster for us
I know best receiver in the league
Yes sir I concur
Are you ready for some football?
Give me a time machine so I can go forward to opening day
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the cardinals will be any good this year?
They can be pretty good.
I think they'll be in the mix for a playoff spot.
How's there schedule?
They have some tough games.
What are the tough ones?
They have the Cowboys and Giants.
Two very tough games.
They also play the Seahawks twice,the Texans and the Eagles.
All tough games for sure.
Some easier ones are the rams twice,the titans,the jaguars and the colts.
You just never know week to week.
Yes that's true.
I wouldn't count the colts as easy though.
No,I agree with that.
They can definitely improve.
Andrew luck needs a big bounce back year.
He's certainly capable of that.
He threw a lot of interceptions last year.
Yes,that was surprising.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man that pass was good
Yeah he aced it
I wonder how they get so good
What do you mean
You  know at their passing
I am not sure
Like it's just something I've wondered
Makes sense to wonder
Yeah like did they learn or what
I am sure their is more to it
Like what
I am not sure
Why
Because I do not know
Maybe natural talent?
That is a possibility
It is likely to be honest
Hm?
Cannot learn to throw for the broncos like that
True enough
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like Jacksonville's chances this year?
Not much to be honest with you.
But they're getting better don't you think?
Their defense is getting better, not the offense.
They seem to have a carousel at QB.
I just don't think Blake Bortles is the answer.
He's been a drag on them for the most part.
I think they'll give up on him after this year and rebuild.
I like the defense though.
Yeah, lots of talent there.  Jalen Ramsey is a real good player.
He was a good pick for them for sure.  Tons of upside.
And if he can get healthy, I want to see what Dante Fowler can do.
Yeah, I miss not seeing him rush the passer.  Sad that he missed his whole first year.
You know who I'm excited to see on defense for them is Myles Jack.
Yeah, that guy should be a beast.
I'm hoping he's healthy now to start.
He had tons of talent coming out of UCLA.
Right, now's the time to bounce back from his knee injury.
Who knows, maybe their offense will click for them this year.
Not likely, but Leonard Fournette will help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Dolphins will turn the corner?
No I think Tannehill is an average quarterback
Do you think Adam Gase will get canned this year?
No he has some latitude with that
In what respect?
He has won alot of games with them with for no good reason
Oh ok so will anyone challenge the Patriots?
This year?
Yeah.
No I think Bills have the best chance
I dont even think they have a legit starter
Yes they do
Tyrod Taylor is not a real quarterback
Yeah he is, he shown he can handle it
Rex Ryan set them back for years.
I dont think thats true.
Just watch, they wont be good for another decade.
They havent been good in a decade
The Jets have the best shot at unseating the Pats.
Yeah but its so slim.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL will be this year?  And you can't say Tom Brady.
Wow, that kind of ties my hands, but I'll give it a shot.
Okay, then.  Who are you picking?
How about Aaron Rodgers?  He definitely makes the Packers go.
That's a pretty good choice; I'll give you that.  But how about Matt Ryan?
He's pretty good for sure, but that Super Bowl loss last year makes me wonder about his big game ability.
To be fair, you can't really blame that all on him.  The offensive coordinator made several questionable play calls in the second half.
No doubt.  And the Falcons could never get back in an offensive rhythm.
I would have loved to have seen Atlanta win that game.
Me too.  I was really rooting for them.
Hopefully, they will be able to make a return to the big game this season.
I don't know.  Sometimes even the best teams never make it back.
All right, then.  Who do you see in the Super Bowl this year if not the Falcons?
Call me crazy, but I think the Cowboys or the Packers may have a shot in the NFC.
Who's your AFC pick?
I'll take the Chiefs or maybe the Raiders, but it will probably be the Patriots.
I'd be happy to see either KC or Oakland?  It would be nice to see someone new have some success.
Even though Brady is awesome and a decent guy, it's time for someone else to have a turn, indeed.
Well, only about 2 months until the season begins and we can start seeing how it will all fall into place.
Oh man, I can hardly wait!  I've been needing an pro football fix ever since the Super Bowl ended!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you watching the Broncos game tomorrow?
HELL YEAH!
What to see it in person?
HELL YEAH!  You got tickets?
I do, got bleachers for Evesco Field all year thanks to work.
I knew should of taken  that job.
Duh, a dealership owned by John Elway is going to have perks!
Wait, isn't Terrel Davis supposed to be there this game?
Yes, he'll be signing autographs in the delta hall after the game.
Anyone else?
Yes, Peyton Manning.
Oh My GOD! Payton Manning!  Do you remember that 100 yard pass?
111 yards!
That was savage.
I wonder if he still holds the record?
Yes, second is Brett Farve.
I HaTE Green BAY!
The cheese sure is good though!
Kick off is at 1, we should be there by noon.  So what leave here around 10?
And miss out on the tailgate parties?  I say we leave at 8!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How often do you like to watch NFL football?
Pretty often, who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers since I'm from around Pittsburgh.
I really don't like them since I'm from around Philly and like the Eagles.
Thats too bad because I think we are going to win the super bowl this year.
Really? How many more years do you think Ben Roethlisberger has?
I'm not sure but definitely no more than five.
Yeah I can't imagine he'll be playing in the league for much longer.
How often do you get to go to the Eagles games?
Not too often, I usually have to work on Sunday mornings so I never get to actually go to the games.
Surely you could go when they play Sunday or Monday night!
Yeah I could, the last time I went they played the Baltimore Ravens and it was a really good game.
That's awesome, did you like seeing Joe Flacco play?
Yeah it was really cool to see him play since he's so good but I didn't like to see him do well against the Eagles.
Did you know the Baltimore Ravens used to be the Baltimore Colts?
Yeah I did! My dad used to be a big fan of them and the Houston Oilers.
Houston used to be the Oilers? That's crazy I thought they were always the Texans!
No! Although the Texans are a really good team nowadays after making it into the playoffs last year.
Yeah since they got the new head coach Bill O'Brien they've been doing really well.
I forgot about that, didn't he coach for a college team recently?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready for NFL preseason?
Yea man I have been waiting on it all year!
Can not wait for the first game to start already.
Hopefully its a good year for the Seahawks again.
The last few years they have been doing very good.
That is why I think they will be good this year.
They will have some competition on their hands this year though.
What team is their competition?
They have a few teams that are ready to beat them to the Super Bowl this year.
Which team do you think has the best chances for the Super Bowl this year?
I hope that the Colts make it this year finally.
That would be nice to see them make it this year.
It has been almost 10 years since they made them last year.
Wow! I did not realize that it was that long ago.
Yea it has been that long.
Well maybe this year it will be the Colts versus the Seahawks this year.
Our two favorite teams facing off would be fun.
So you wanna come over and watch the first preseason game at my house this year?
Yea sure that would be fun.
Alright then Ill see you there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think are some up and coming teams this year in the NFL?
Up and coming teams. Tampa Bay and Tennessee come to mind.
I could see those two teams. Tampa was in the playoff hunt last year.
And they are playing in the NFC South. Seems like a different team wins that division every year.
It seems that way because it's pretty much true.
Tampa could win that division this year. They have a lot of talent on offense.
Yes, Jameis Winston and Mike Evans will continue to put up big numbers.
I could see them as a 10-6 or 11-5 team.
11 and 5 might be stretching it. But yes, I definitely could see 10 and 6.
Tennessee also may be up and coming. They are playing in the AFC South.
The AFC South is definitely the weakest division in football.
By a mile. I believe Mariotta will be back in the lineup to start the season.
9 and 7 might win that division.
9 and 7 could. Tennessee could easily go 9 and 7.
Houston is kind of fading out. They have another quarterback this year, don't they.
I think so. They change quarterbacks like I change socks.
Indianapolis is always in the hunt in the AFC South.
Luck has ran into a lot of bad luck recently. Not sure what's wrong with him.
He might not be as good as advertised. He's a good quarterback but not elite.
Not from his past few seasons he's not. He's still young and can turn it around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Could you believe the foorball season is right around the corner?
NOpe! Can you?
Me either. I seriously cannot wait. Have you had a chance to chekc out the schedule yet?
No, I haven't gotten it in the mail yet. Is it even out yet?
That is a very good question, I am not really sure.
Ya me either. Who do you think is going to win it all this year?
Oh geez, who knows. I would like to say my Steelers, but who the heck knows.
As long as it isn't the Pats right? Lol
So true!
I would like to see an underdog take it this year.
Yeah me too. Or maybe Matty Ice will seek revenge.
Wouldn't that be awesome. Poor guy.
Yeah my heart really went out to him last year. That is one heck of a way to lose.
Or what about the Las Vegas Raiders?
Oh, do not even get me started with that.
I would love to see the black hole take the reigns agaiin and dominate. I just do not see it happening.
The Las Vegas Raiders sounds like an arena football team or something.
Al Davis is rolling around in his grave.
Just win baby.
Right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You psyched about this coming NFL season?
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see my Giants in action.
You think they will make it to the superbowl this year?
I hope so, they have not been there since 2012.
That's a long time, but they have made it to the playoffs.
Yeah, like 30 something times.
Well maybe this year they can make something happen.
We will see. Who you looking to win the superbowl this year?
I would like to see the Pittsburgh steelers get there and win it all.
A couple of my friends like that team.
They're not bad and back in the day it was like they were one big family; just enjoyable to watch.
Remember the song they made after the team? Black and Yellow.
Ha Ha, yes I liked the beat to it, it was catchy. Who made that?
I think it was some rapper named Wiz Khalifa.
Oh. Well the artist did a good job to represent the team.
Yeah and the song will never grow old, because there will always be "Team Steelers."
The Steelers have been to the superbowl 6 times and this year's predictons for the steelers says they have a good chance to make it happen again.
What about the Giants?
It is perdicted that they will have a 12-4 season.
Sweet, I guess we will see. Maybe they will make it a 5th time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Less than one month until some sort of football begins
It's about time.
Who do you think will get over the hump to the Superbowl this season?
I have a feeling that the Cowboys are going to finally reach the big game.
They probably should have made it there last year.
That pass rush they had wasn't god enough.
That was exposed mightily during the Green Bay game in the playoffs.
That was honestly the best game of the season.
I thought it was over when the Packers were blowing them out.
So did I. Then the Cowboys kept scoring and it was suddenly a close game.
I haven't looked at the draft too closely, so I don't know if they drafted on the defensive end last season.
Neither did I. I don't have time to watch a three day event every April.
They probably will have a better defense than last year.
That's all they really need. Everything else can remain the same
Yeah. Elliott, Dak and an unstoppable O-line equals success every time.
That offensive Jerry Jones built is insane.
Aren't all five of the starters first round picks?
I think they are and their backups are even pretty good.
Isn't Doug Free a backup yet he is actually pretty good.
Yeah, but he retired this year, so that depth isn't there anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the best kickers in the NFL?
Well I think Gostkowski has a claim?
The Patriots kicker?
Yes, the one - he has been consistent for so long.
He is good, but I think Hauschka is up there.
Yes, he is great too - on the Seahawks.
What do you think of Vinatieri?
I think he is arguably the greatest of all time.
What makes you say that?
He has so many big moments and has been consistently great.
If only the Colts could get back to dominance.
I think they will this year.
Are you an Andrew Luck fan?
Yes, I think he is amazing - just needs to stay healthy.
What do you think of Carson Palmer?
His best days are gone, but still solid.
He used to be great for the Bengals.
He's still put up decent numbers with the Cardinals.
I agree, but not as great.
He is getting somewhat old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Kind of, but I'm more of a basketball fan.
Oh ok. My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys
Do you watch the games every season?
Yes I do, buy the gear and everything.
Oh that's cool. I guess I like the Pittsburgh Steelers the best.
Oh that's one of our rivals!
I know. Do you like football movies?
I like Remember the Titans.
I like The Replacements.
Oh yeah that's a funny movie.
What other football related things do you like to do?
I'm in a fantasy football league.
Oh really? Do you win money with that?
No it's more like bragging rights.
Oh ok so do you ever win?
I won a lot this past year. I was pretty lucky.
Oh that's cool. My brother played high school football. He was an all star.
Oh that's great, I played too.
I bet you miss it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, well Seattle has won the big game and been to it twice in the past couple years.
Yea and for that, I would not count them out either.
Yea, having all pro safety's like Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman doesn't hurt either.
Yea, would you want to go over the middle to find either of those guys.
I know that I wouldn't and I do not think Odell does either.
Yea, I think that fear factor is one of the main reasons that they will remain in contention.
Yea, I agree. That defense will just have to stay healthy.
Yea, they aren't getting any younger, but man are they fierce.
They are. It would also be nice if Jimmy Graham brought back some of his magic from New Orleans.
Yea, he seems to be focusing too much on blocking.
I agree! His receiving is what separates him as a player. He should use it.
Yea, I mean the blocking is good for Russell Wilson, but he can do so much more to help out.
Yea, Russell Wilson could use all the help he could get.
Yea, when you're a quarterback until six feet, you could really use some playmakers.
Yea, especially since I do not even know who is carrying the ball for them this year.
Yea, me either. Better hope they have a strong offensive line.
Yea, they are going to need that to stay relavant.
I agree, but I wouldn't doubt them.
Me either. They have as good of a chance as anyone still.
I agree. They definitely do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm pumped about the new NFL season. I'm interested in how the teams will work out this year.
Yeah, I have my favorite teams.
With the teams, any idea how all of that works?
Only because I'm self-taught. I've picked things up here and there.
Tell me, how do the teams work?
There are two conferences, with thirty-two clubs. Sixteen teams per conference.
And how do the games work? Must be pretty systematic.
So the conferences are further split into four divisions, consisting of four clubs within each one.
And they all get matched up against each other.
Over a sixteen game season.
How do they pick who plays and who doesn't?
Each team can have up to 53 players, and of those only46 can be "active." playing on game days.
That's a lot of manpower. Lots of active players too.
And this doesn't account for possible practice squad players. They're regulated too.
For a ball game, football has a lot of rules.
Its not bad though. Could be worse.
I like the fact its a homegrown sport.
All the NFL teams are based in the continental US, I believe.
Well maybe. I'll look that one up.
I haven't heard of teams in Hawaii or Alaska!
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL Season is upon us. Who do you think will win it all?
I hate to say it, but you gotta go with the Patriots right?
I know but I'm a little tired of them.
I understand that, but how can you bet against Tom Brady?
You really can't but hopefully some other teams give it a go.
Well I believe the Steelers still have a chance to take them down.
I was thinking Dallas had a chance this year.
They might have a chance but they are still a young team.
They are an exciting team, and have some talent.
I understand that, but I don't think Dak, and Zeek are ready for that next step.
If you don't think they can take it then who?
Only a handful of teams look good enough. Maybe Atlanta, Steelers like I said, Seattle, or Green Bay
I can't stand any of those teams. Hopefully there will be surprise this year.
There always seem to be a team or two who comes out of nowhere in the NFL
Yes, that is why I love the NFL, more than any of the other major sports.
Sports has been very dull without NFL over past few months.
It has been but only 2 months before we get NFL Countdown on ESPN.
Also only a month before we start drafting our fantasy teams.
Man all this talk is just getting me excited, I really can't wait...Just hate winter will follow with it.
Haha. That is the only downfall of the football season, is it does get cold.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season.
Football? It's still baseball season.
I know but it's getting close and,I'm getting excited.
Me too,nothing like football every week.
Dallas and Giants open again right?
Yes they do.
Of course at Dallas again.
Of course it is.
Jerry Jones gets his way.
He always does.
I can't believe he's in the hall of fame.
I know,why I don't know though.
Because he has money.
Yea,and,so,called americas team.
Yea,americas thugs.
Another cowboy arrested.
Who this time.
Damien Wilson.
The linebacker?
Yes,the linebacker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dez Bryant is going to tear the league up this year.
Doubtful in my opinion.
Well, your opinion is your opinion.  Trust me, the X will get thrown up.
It feels like Dez has been in the league forever yet there's still tons of receivers better than him.
In some cases of the game maybe.
In all cases I would say.
You're crazy.  He's got awesome hands.
But he drops a lot of passes, led the league a few years back I think.
Don't remember that.  His hands are huge.
But he's not very fast.
He's plenty fast enough.  Look at how many touchdowns he scores.
Anyone can score if they are wide open.
And how do you think he gets that wide open?
Because defenses are keying on Beasley and Witten all the time.
That's crazy talk.  You obviously don't watch any games.
I've seen enough to know he's overrated.
I wouldn't take anyone else over him in the red zone.
You're obviously not thinking hard enough.
I'm thinking plenty hard.  He's the best red zone receiver in the league.
Laughable, but whatever you say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate watching some of the NFL games, when good teams play against teams that just aren't any good.
I think most if not all of the teams are good though, aren't they?
Some are total trash.
Well in any league, in any sport, there will always be teams at the bottom.
That is true, expect in some leagues the bottom teams get relegated if they don't do well. It doesn't work like that in the NFL.
If you had to demote a team, which one would you kick out of the league?
The Cleveland Browns.
I've never even heard of them!
Exactly my point..
Are they a new team?
Not at all! They've been in the NFL for about 50 years.
Why haven't I heard of them?
Have you heard of the Baltimore Ravens?
Of course I have. You wouldn't demote them as well would you?
No I wouldn't. The Ravens was actually born out of the Browns as an expansion team.
When was this? I don't remember any of this happening.
This happened back in the 90's. Ever since then the Brown just have never been able to hold their own.
That's rough. I'm guessing they play in the American Football Conference?
Yes they do. They've never even ever made it to the Superbowl.
I'm going to have to do some reading up on them, but I do see your point. They don't sound like a team I'd want to go see play.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lonnie Devers just got married.
He did?
Yep.  They said after winning the Super Bowl, he decided to do it.
Who'd he marry?
His college sweetheart.
That's so sweet.
He basically won the Bowl for his team.
Wow.
I guess success makes men settle down!
Ha ha.
So maybe he will play better than ever now.
That would be exciting.
How many touchdowns does he have so far this season?
I think he's at 7.
Man, he's good.
He will probably finish with 20-25.
He's one of the best.
I'm so proud of him.
Me too.
I'll be watching.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you read the news about Michael Vick?
No, what happened to him this time?
He actually has been entered into Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame.
I forgot that he helped Virginia Tech to the 2000 national title game.
Yes, he was brought good public attention to Virginia Tech for the years that he was there.
He finished 3rd in the 1999 Heisman Trophy voting.
And... was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft as he left Virginia Tech after the 2000 season.
Yes, he was doing really well until it was determined that he was heavy into betting on dog fighting.
That was so disappointing to learn about.  Just tragic for everyone involved.
A lot of those dogs he abused have been rehabilitated and adopted out.
I think he did pay for a lot of that or was required to pay for it.
Did he serve time in prison for his involvement?
Yes, he did -- deservedly so.  It was awful what he did to those dogs, let alone how illegal it all was.
It is a shame, because before that he was really having a great football career.
I know he holds NFL records for rushing yards for a quarterback.
Did you realize he played 13 seasons in the NFL with four different teams.
It might seem that that is a lot of moving around, but I guess it is quite common place for a talented quarterback.
I remember him with the Steelers, Jets, and Falcons.
He announced his retirement officially this past February 2017.
I read where he retired as an Atlanta Falcon.  We'll see what happens next for him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I would like to see Tom Brady on a different team
Like the Browns?
Yea a team like that.
Why do you say that?
I just want to know if hes a product of Belichick or not.
He has sustained it too long to be a product of a system.
But we may never know
We probably wont but who can stay this good for that long?
Anyone I think!
No eventually you lose it, like Manning did.
He was an outworldy talent.
And we found that out through multiple head coaches
Yeah so you see where I am going
Yeah I tend to agree with you now
So I would think he could be able to reproduce these results, right?
Yes but I dont think hes going anywhere
Well would you rebuild a team with him
great question, i probably would
But you wouldnt win now and hes older.
Yeah this is sort of a catch 22. great food for thought though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the NFL season this year?
Absolutely, just one more month until pre-season.starts.
i don't really watch pre-season but I am excited that the regular season is on two months away.
I never cared about the pre-season either until last year when Tony Romo got hurt.
It was a magical season for the Cowboys last year.
It sure was and if it had not been for pre-season, Dak Prescott may have never received his chance to play.
The only thing that would have made it better would have been making it to the Superbowl.
It definitely would have been great to make the Superbowl but I think winning the Superbowl would have been inspirinng.
Yes, I would have loved to have seen the Cowboys beat the Patriots.
I was really hoping that New England would have lost last years Superbowl.
I had hoped the same but the Falcons really gave them a run for their money.
I was pretty certain too that Atlanta was going to win but then Brady woke up in the 3rd quarter.
It was a crazy and fabulous game and it was so exciting to watch.
It is not very often that a Superbowl game is close in the score.
Did you think Atlanta was going to win?
I truly did think they were going to win as they were playing good ball and had a huge lead going into the second half.
What do you predict to happen this season?
I actually believe the Arizona Cardinals are on a mission this coming season.
I would love to see Larry Fitzgerald get a Superbowl ring.
Me too.  Is it September yet?
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Jets are going to be so bad this year!
Worse than the Browns last year?
Yeah, definitely.
Why do you think that?
They have no quarterback!
They have Mccown!
Who was the quarterback of the horrible Browns!
That is true I suppose.
On top of that they have gutted their entire team.
Who did they lose for this season.
Well, first off Revis.
He was getting old anyway.
Yeah but he still had the smarts at least.
Yeah, I guess. I think he was only in it for the money.
Duh! But then again most players are.
Yeah.  Who else is gone?
Mangold was so good for them for so long and he is gone too.
Oh man, that is a shame!
Yeah, this season is going to suck. Being a Jets fan is difficult.
You've got that right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Cardinals.
The Arizona Cardinals?
Yes
I think they are decent
They are. I don't see them winning any title though.
I agree. Glad you admitted it.
I am a realist.
Who do you think will win it?
The Patriots
Again?
Yes
I doubt they will repeat.
The Penguins did in hockey.
It is harder in the NFL
I see what you mean
Do you like Brady?
Yes. He is good at football
He is. Will he win the MVP?
Maybe
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Do you like football?
American Football?
Yes.
Yeah I love it.
Do you watch a lot of NFL games?
Yeah I do.
So you must be a pretty big fan.
Yeah I would say so.  I like the Panthers a lot.
Oh okay. I'm a Falcons fan.
Tough break about your loss in the super bowl.
Yeah that was pretty awful.
What happened?
Man I have no idea.  They were up so big.
I bet you were already celebrating.
I don't want to talk about it, still to raw.
Fair enough.
Good chatting with you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, do you watch NFL?
Sure, I watch a few here and there. I live in the Chicago area, so I guess I have reason to root for the Bears.
So, you don't say?
Yeah, but I don't have much time to watch, I work a lot.
It would be nice for the Bears to get a championship.
Yeah, I remember that one time when they last made it to the Superbowl.
I remember that to, they made it all the way that far but lost.
Yeah, they should have one that one, they did really well that year.
I like the Bears too, just wish they were more competitive.
Me too, if you play for a big city like Chicago, you should go out and play well.
They still talk about Urlacher and he's long retired.
Yeah, I mean he played defense right?
Yes, he was like a defensive back.
We just need a better overall team.
Yes, I agree with that.
Yeah, its a tough sport.
I like the Colts.
You do? That's cool.
Yeah, I live in the Indy area, so I go to their games when I can.
That's cool. Sounds interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Dallas Cowboys will do this season?
Based on their 13-3 record last season, I think that they have the best odds of making the Super Bowl of any team in the NFC.
Seriously? Have you seen their playoff record over the past 20 years?
Playoff games are always funny things and they should have won that 2015 game in Green Bay. Moreover, this is a much more experienced team than last year.
This season will only be Dak Prescott's second season. He's bound to regress.
That sometimes happens with sophomore quarterbacks, but not always. Ben Roethlisberger and Russell Wilson both won Super Bowls during their sophomore seasons.
Yeah, but more often than not, opposing teams learn how to better plan for quarterbacks after their rookie seasons, which leads to regression.
While this may be the case, Dallas's offensive advantage largely stems not from the quarterback position, but from their running game and their amazing offensive line.
I can't argue with you on their offensive line. However, their leading rusher is still under investigation from the NFL and could be suspended for part of next year.
While I remain concerned regarding the Ezekiel Elliott situation, I doubt that he will be suspended for more than 4 games, if that. Also, their offensive line is so strong that it won't matter much who runs the ball.
So you think that a 29-year old Darren McFadden could be their leading rusher?
Darren McFadden would probably not be a great leading rusher. However, they have Alfred Morris, who was amazing in Washington during his early career.
I totally forgot about him. However, he went from Pro Bowl to back up in less than two seasons.
Morris was overworked and under protected in Washington. The situation in Dallas is much better.
I guess we'll have to see. Also, I'm very concerned about Dallas's defense this season.
Really? Sean Lee continues to be one of the most underrated defensive players in the league and should lead an effective defense.
Lee is great when he's healthy, which is not often.
I think that between Lee's leadership and some promising players in the defensive secondary, defense should not be a major issue for Dallas.
All I know is that they were ranked 26th against the pass last year. I would be more concerned about their defense if I were you.
Between Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, and Dez Bryant, they can easily score enough points per game to overcome any defensive issues.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You a big Bengals fan?
I was, but then they broke my heart.
How so?
Super Bowl XXIII
Oh, did they lose that one?
Yes, by four points and at the very end.
Man that's too bad.
Yeah, it was a killer to watch.
Who was their QB back then?
Boomer Esiason
Oh yeah, I thought he was pretty good back in the day.
Yep, they also had Icky Woods
Oh that's right. The Icky Shuffle.
That's right.
Wasn't he a rookie back then.
Yes, that was his rookie season.
Didn't do much after that.
Not really. Kind of fell away.
Until he appeared on a Geico commercial.
Oh yeah, that was funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Zeke is a beast! Zeke and Dak should take the cowboys to the Superbowl!
Here we go again. Cowboys need a better receiving core, if they're to go to the Superbowl, let alone win it
Their receivers aren't very good. They could be so much better.
You know what's funny? The longest pass Dak's ever thrown in 2016 wasn't caught by their receivers.
Oh yeah, Zeke caught it.
Yep, against the Steelers, 83 yards!.
That's long for WRs even
Yep. Zeke's gonna be a valuable player.
You know Dak passes as much as Brady, even slightly more.
yep, they're both above 3500 yards for the last year
And Pat's total rushing is 1872, and Cowboys 2396.
Yep. But look at their TDs. 24 Rushing TDs, and 25 receiving TDs for the Cowboys.
And the pats have... 19 rushing TDs and 32 receiving TDs. See that's not that impressive over the Cowboys
Well, it's not so much how TDs you have, how many more you have over your opponent when you're playing the game
So then why bother looking at season TD numbers?
It shows the strengths and pattern of their plays, which is important to make prediction as to what will unfold this year
I don't know, man, this is getting too complicated
Well, this is what it means to analyze the teams. And there are so many dimensions to look at
To think there are people who do this for a living
Yep. Football anbalysts work for TV channels and fantasy sites. Unless they're famous, they don't make much though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you guess how many football players have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?
I didn't know any of them did.
There's one.
I have no clue as to who it would be.
Terry Bradshaw.
Oh he played with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Not only that, but he became a game analyst for CBS after he quit playing.
I know he also appeared in different TV shows and movies.
Not that long ago I watched him in a reality series called Better Late Than Never.
Oh the show with William Shatner and Henry Winkler. I loved that show.
Me too, and he was really funny when he got drunk.
I read where the show was renewed for a second season.
I'll be sure to watch it.
Considering so many football players go broke when their careers are over, it's nice to see that he continued on to do other things after football.
Especially since having such a great career in the sport.
Sure between winning MVP and being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
And think of the energy he still has for his age.
I know.
Well I'm going to look forward to the new season of his show.
So am I and we should watch it together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if the Redskins and Kirk Cousins will agree on a long-term deal.
Washington can't afford to keep going with this year-by-year franchise tag, can they?
They can get away with it this year, but it will cost a fortune - at least $35 million, I believe - to use a tag for the third consecutive year.
So what do the Redskins do, then?
Cousins seems set on testing free agency in 2018, and it seems there is mutual interest between him and the 49ers.
Well, Cousins obviously has the previous connection with San Francisco's new coach, Kyle Shanahan.
Right, and it's not like the 49ers have a franchise quarterback on the current roster.
So it seems like a natural fit.
Nothing is that easy, though, because the Redskins could still use the transition tag on Cousins.
How does that work?
For around $29 million, which would easily be enough to make Cousins the NFL's highest paid player, they can use the tag to keep the option to match any other team's offer.
That's a ton of money though, why would the Redskins use this tag but not just come to terms on a normal long-term deal?
I read an article that the owner, Dan Snyder, would rather overpay for Cousins then to see him leave for the 49ers.
So it's personal, then?
Pretty much, it goes back a few years when Shanahan and his father Mike, then the head coach, had a falling out with Snyder.
Well, if I'm the 49ers, I don't know that I'd want to overpay for Cousins anyway.
That's a good point because he's a good quarterback but is he really elite?
He hasn't won a playoff game yet and he's 28 years old.
Besides, the 2018 draft is apparently loaded with promising quarterbacks.
I would prefer that route for San Francisco, especially since the team is clearly in rebuilding mode at this point.

You bet i am I love spending my Sunday's watching football.
What does your wife thinking you watching football all day Sunday.
Oh she doesn't seem to mind she is a casual fan herself.
What do you mean by a casual fan.
Well she might warch a few mintues of the game and the go to something else.
Oh so not like us guys who park in front of the TV all day in the fall.
Exactly, but she does cheer for the Seahawks.
Well of course she does since you live in Seattle.
For some reason we have a lot of Oaklands fans her too.
I can't understand that.
Me either I mean Oakland hasn't even been that good before last  year.
So what chance do you think the Seahawks have this year?
I think they have a good chance as long as Russell Wilson stays healthy.
Yep, but will stay healthy if the Offensive line doesn't protect him better.
That my friend is the million dollar question.
Yeah I hope so I would hate to see him get taken out because they Seahawks woudn't put together a good offensice line.
No kidding; it has been a weakness for years you think they would fix it.
If the Seahawks wouldn't make do you have another team you watch.
Not really though since i was born in Indianapolis I do kinda cheer for them.
Well it shouild be a fun season no matter what happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL football?
Yes the Cowboys are my favorite team.
Yea they are good.
Do  you have a favorite team?
Yea, the Eagles.
Oh, I do not care for that team at all.
Wow that is harsh.
Do you think they will ever make it to the Superbowl?
I am hoping they make it this year.
I doubt that.
Why?
They stink.
Well , the Cowboys are not always the best.
Better than the Eagles though.
What is your favorite part of the superbowl?
Half time, the music.
Yea half time is good!
Also the commercials!
Maybe my team will win the superbowl this year.
I doubt it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch football?
Yeah, I do. Why do you ask?
Well I watch it a lot and I wanted to know your favorite team.
My favorite team is the Cleveland Browns, what's yours?
I would have to say the New York Giants.
Do you have any favorite foods you like to eat while watching games?
Yes, I always get hot wings and sometimes nachos. How about you?
Well, sometimes I have had hot wings during games. I usually have pizza though.
I love pizza, what kind do you usually get?
I enjoy almost any type of pizza, but do you mean my favorite?
Yeah, what is your favorite pizza?
I would have to say supreme.
What does that have on it?
Green peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, cheese, onions, and sausage.
Wow, that sounds like a really good pizza.
Yeah, I always like the ones with more ingredients on them.
I'm gonna have to check that out next time I get pizza.
I would definitely recommend it, and you could order wings from the same place too.
You, know that's a really good idea. Thanks a lot.
No problem, enjoy yourself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL season is almost here, are you going to any games?
No, I don't have a team near me, but I can't wait to watch some of the receivers this year.
There are a lot of amazing receivers to watch this year, I'm looking forward to Odell Beckham Jr.'s performance, he makes some incredible catches.
He does, do you think he will have a better year than Antonio Brown?
I'm not sure, Brown is really good and the Steelers have a good run game that helps avoid double coverage.
I'd guess that Brown has more receiving yards and touchdowns, but I still think some of the best plays of the year will come from Beckham, he is a great athlete.
The Steelers are going to be good again this year, Leveon Bell was impressive last year and he doesn't have any suspensions this year.
I bet you are right, I wonder how good Bell can be receiving out of the backfield, that was really hard to combat on defense last year.
I remember watching Kansas City play them, and they did pretty good, but you are right.  Covering both Brown and Bell is really hard.
I remember that game, Tyreek Hill looked good for Kansas City.
He could break out even more this year.  He is extremely fast.
Also, Kansas City didn't resign Jeremy Maclin, so Hill could get a lot more opportunities.
Then he could go crazy because he did not get a lot of targets last year, and still had some of the best highlights in the game.
Alex Smith will never be a gun slinger, but Hill scores from behind the line of scrimmage, so that may not matter.
What about Tom Brady throwing to Brandon Cooks this year?
That will be devastating.  He will have Gronkowski and Cooks, they will be frustrating teams once again.
If I had to pick, I think Brown, then Beckham, then Cooks, then Hill for most touchdowns this year, in that order.
I like that list, I think we are missing someone though.
Who is that?
Dez Bryant, he could have the most of anyone on that team with such a great offense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Sure do!
Favorite team?
Bills
The Bills!?!?
Yea, man!
Why them?  They're terrible!
I grew up there
Poor thing...
Hey!...
Haha! Patriots rule!
Oh, god... you're one of those!
I Sure am!
We can't talk now...
Understood
Glad that's settled
Bye then...
Bye!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the mascots are pretty fun to watch at the football games.
Some of them really have personalities.
Do you have any favorites?
Jaxson de Ville is pretty entertaining.
Oh he's really creative.
I know. He has lots of fun ways to enter the stadium.
I think Sourdough Sam is interesting because he changes his costumes.
Isn't he the mascot for the 49ers?
He is.
I think Pat Patriot is a good match for the Patriots.
Well I think Rampage has a good looking mask for the Rams.
Are there any mascots you don't like the costumes for?
I don't care for the masks of the mascots of the Denver Broncos.
How come?
They're just so small and not that animated.
Does every team have a mascot?
No, some of them don't.
Any idea as to why?
I really don't have a clue.
At least most of the teams do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your all time favorite NFL team?
Denver Broncos
Really? How come?
I lived in Denver for a few years when I was a kid.
Oh yeah, what years?
1989 - 1993
Oh so you were there for the John Elway years
Yes indeed. One of the greatest QBs of all-time.
Well I don't know about that.
What do you mean, he went to the Super Bowl five times.
And lost 3 times.
Because he didn't have a good team
I don't buy that.
It's more impressive that he made it to the Super Bowl with those teams in the 80s.
Yeah, I don't know. I hear that excuse a lot
And when he finally got some decent support crew like Terrell Davis, they won.
How many times did he win
Twice, back to back. 1997 and 1998.
Who did they beat
Packers and Falcons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the offseason news?
Yes I do everyday
What is the biggest story according to you?
I think the bears signing Mike Glennon for such a huge amount of money
Yeah I agree, what were they thinking?
Obviously they weren't thinking
And then they turned around and drafted a quarterback
That must've felt bad for Glennon
I would be mad if I were him
I heard the head coach didn't even know the bears were gonna do that
Yeah I would've felt betrayed by that
I think the coach certainly did
I think the bears are in a bad place for the upcoming year
Yeah, but they deserve it with those horrible off season moves
I feel bad for the fans
I know a few personally, and they really are starting to hate the team
Then they should make some changes without a doubt
I feel like some of those may be coming
It will be for the better though, the Bears cannot get much worse.
At least the fans can find solace in that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Susie you watching the game tonight?
Oh definitely Bob is in town and he doesn't miss his Eagles games.
I love the Eagles actually, do you watch the games with him?
Hell yeah, they are my team!
I didn't know that about you, very cool.
You should come through, I didn't know you were such a big NFL fan yourself.
I used to play in high school, quarterback.
Oh wow, who is your favorite QB in the NFL?
Since we're talking Eagles I might as well say Carson Wentz, the guy is an inspirational rookie.
He is definitely amazing, in a  couple years he will be perfect.
Rookie seasons are hard for everyone, very up and down.
he has to fit in with the Eagles' coaching and team, once he gets acclimated he will be good.
I completely agree, just better sooner than later.
Who are they playing?
They are playing the Saints tonight!
Oh man I gotta watch that matchup, Drew Breez vs Wentz.
I love that matchup too, very cool when the old school faces new blood.
I couldn't have said it better myself!
Game starts at around 7pm, be here a bit before.
Ok, let me change into my Eagles jersey and I'll be there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you get your new TV yet for the NFL football season.
Yes I did! I got a new 84 inch LCD flat screen that should help us get into the game!
Man I can't wait for the season to start.
Me either! NFL pre-season should be starting next month.
Who is your favorite team this year?
My  favorite team is the New York Giants.
Who is the Giants quarterback?
Eli Manning is the Giants quarterback and has been for a long time.
When did Eli start with the Giants?
The Giants drafted Eli back in 2004 and he has been there since.
How has he done given his brother is the great Peyton Manning?
Eli has had a stellar career with the Giants winning two Super Bowls.
Thats right, who did they beat in the 2008 Super Bowl?
The Giants beat the Patriots in one of the greatest comebacks ever.
Thats right! I remember the epic one hand catch off the helmet on 4th down to save the game.
Eli made that game saving throw while almost being sacked!
That was one of the best and most exciting Giants game of all time.
Yes it was, the Giants were a huge underdog to the Patriots.
I hope this NFL season is just as exciting!
Well at least it will look great on that new super huge TV!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, I can't wait for football season to start this year.
What a season the Patriots had last year!
Yeah, how do you top coming from the biggest deficit ever and winning a super bowl?
Well, you could win back to back super bowls!
Yeah, that is a good point!  Imagine that?
They have put themself in a really good position again this year it appears.
I know they have the best wide receiving corps I have ever seen on an NFL roster.
Yeah Amendola, Edelman, Hogan, Mitchell, Cooks, and a healthy Gronk!
That is a scary matchup for any defense!
They also brought on a pro-bowl caliber cornerback, and still have one on the roster from last year.
Right, I hope they find a way to keep Malcolm Mitchell long term.
Me too, I love him as a player.
He makes that big play when you need it.
Yeah, and in the biggest games like the superbowl.
That is the kind of player you just have to pay!
I hope your right, I would hate to see him leave.
Well, at least we have him this year at the least!
Yeah, its going to be a great season.
Yeah, as long they can stay healthy!
Amen to that brother!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the most controversial football player?
Probably Tom Brady
Because of the football-gate?
Inflate-gate it was called.
Do you really think that something criminal happened?
I don't know. It is possible. They sure won a lot in the winter.
Yes, they did but Tom Brady is a great player.
I don't know. You don't think he is over rated?
Maybe a little, but for his age he is fantastic.
That is true. I wonder what kind of regime he is on?
I heard he does something with oxygen.
Maybe a hyperbaric chamber?
I don't know, It is something.
Well, the Patriots are a really good team.
It could also be that their coach happens to be fantastic.
Yes, Bill Belczyk is a great coach.
I think he has a lot to do with their winning.
Well, it does get a great coach to get all the players to play well.
He is the playmaker.
He does get the team to perform properly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts for NFL football this season
I don't know, I always get my hopes up for the Lions, but they always disappoint me
Ha! That's true maybe this will be they're year
Yeah, I always think that right around the 3rd or 4th game, but by the 10th game I'm usually brought back to reality.
Do you think we'll ever see them at the Super Bowl?
Honestly no, I think I'd faint if we ever made it into the Super Bowl.
Well in the mean time I'll be pulling for The Bears
Uh, not again with The Bears
What? They are a solid team!
Yeah yeah yeah, we have this discussion every year.
Don't be bitter because they have more solid seasons than your Lions
Okay lets not go there
I think we'll both just be happy of the Patriots don't make it to the Super Bowl
Ain't that the truth. I'm so over them even being in the Super Bowl
I know Brady doesn't need another ring.
Right, he's gotten too cocky.
What do you think about the Sea Hawks?
I wouldn't mind seeing them go all the way
Agreed, ya know, them or the Bears
Or the lions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about football season?
Yes, and it is quickly approaching!
It sure is; the NFL can not get here fast enough in my opinion!
Football fans can not stand to go a long time without watching the game we love!
Speaking of football, which position do you feel is the hardest to play?
Are you talking about in terms of physically or mentally?
You can use any criteria; just what position do you think is the toughest to perform at a high level at?
That is a really tough question!
I think I would say that quarterback is the toughest to play.
Would you say that because of all the hits that they take?
Not really; I just feel that having to know so much verbiage would be really difficult.
That combined with having to process so much mentally would be challenging.
Would you agree with me then?
Actually, I feel that playing cornerback would be the toughest position to play.
That is interesting. Why do you say that?
Well, with so many great, athletic receivers out there today; I just can not imagine keeping up with them.
Especially having to cover certain guys one on one for the length of the field.
Exactly! Can you imagine trying to cover Julio Jones all by yourself?
Well, often times those guys get help from their safeties with the big time receivers.
That is true, but there are normally several plays each game when they are all by themselves!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What you watching?
The big game.
Who's playing?
My favorite team- the Lions.
Cool, are they winning?
Not yet, it's tied.
Who is your favorite player?
Ken Stevens, the linebacker.
I like him too.
He's big and strong.
He's been playing for 8 years right?
Yes.
His run may be over soon.
Yes, he's getting there.
Retirement may come soon.
I think he has 3 years left in him.
If he sticks with the Lions.
I hope he does.
Yes, they need him!
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, here's a question for you: What is the most overrated and most underrated NFL position?
You mean like in the organization or on the field?
Let's go with field position for now.
Ok, I'll bite. I will say the most overrated position is the Wide Receiver
Wide Receiver? What makes you think so?
They are a great weapon in the QB's arsenal, and I'm not saying they aren't important, but they get a lot more publicity as a part of the team.
See for me I think it's the QB who's most overrated.
Why? They are part of every play!
Just like with the WR, I'm not saying they aren't important, but a lot of what they do is a result of what the other players do.
That's true, you put Tom Brady behind a rookie line and he'll look like a rookie QB
Exactly, that's why I think Offensive Line positions are the most underrated.
Because they give the QB the opportunity he needs to make the pass?
Exactly, Manning's last years with Denver show this. If he had time in the pocket and good routes, he was the best QB ever.
Exactly, but when the OL had all those injuries and restructures his rating fell bad.
I know, but they always act like it's all the QB.
Yep, and for me I would say Punter or kicker is most underrated.
Interesting, why those ones?
The punter makes the difference in a game so often by determining field position and a great punter can end another team.
Oh yeah, a punt followed by a safety is brutal.
Don't forget what a 50 yard field goal can do in a close game either and that kind of precision is not common.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo
Hey
What you think of the juice
What?
You know OJ
Simpson?
Yeah man
Oh yea
So?
Didn't he hurt his wife or something
I am pretty sure he was acquitted
Still
I mean in regards to the NFL
He was a good player
One of the best right?
Eh
What?
Not sure about that
Why
Because I ain't
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your opinion on deflategate?
What's deflategate?
The whole cheating scandal with the Patriots?
I've never heard about this.
Oh, it's an interesting story though.
Tell me about it?
So, I guess during a championship game against the Colts, the Patriots were using deflated balls.
Deflated how?
So, normally balls have to be inflated to a particular pressure, to be used in an NFL game.
That makes sense.
So they, or someone on the Patriots, was deflating the balls.
What does that do, game-wise?
It's softer. So it's easier to both throw and catch.
That sounds like a huge advantage!
It was a big deal. The Ravens claimed that the same thing happened to them in a game with the patriots, too.
So what ended up happening?
The patriots were given a million dollar fine and Tom Brady had to sit out four games as a penalty.
Wow, that doesn't seem like enough for cheating.
I don't think so either!
They should be careful down the road.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Who is your favorite player?
Player ?
Yeah athlete
Ohhh
So?
What sport?
Hmm
Yes?
How about foot ball
American or Europe
NFL
Oh that one is easy
So who is it
It is Michael Vick
He was a good player
One of the best of his era
Easily
To bad he can't stay forever
I know right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Rams do better in Los Angeles this year?
They probably cannot do any worse!
How will things improve.
Well, first there is new coach Sean McVay.
Really?     What happened to Jeff Fisher.
He was fired.    A couple of seasons too late in my opinion
OK.     What about Todd Gurley?
An unimpressive year last year, but expect better.
What about the defensive side?
There are a couple of bright spots.
Which positions are you thinking of?
Well, first Alec Ogletree had a Pro Bowl class season.
True.    Any others?
I see a bright future for Robert Quinn.
Any thoughts on attendance?
I think Los Angeles may warm to having a team back.
What about competition from the Chargers?
Los Angeles covers a huge populace.
I suppose you are correct.
There are two MLB and NBA teams in the area with good support.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the practice footage for the upcoming game?
After watching that, I got back into the NFL again.
What team are you cheering for.
I'm hoping hte Bears can improve.
Me too, but they probably won't do much without Manning.
I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out?
I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
That's an away game.
Yeah, it is. However, Manning doesn't falter at home or away.
Who's starting while Mannings out?
I think they are rotating rookies until his return.
How long as their current coach been in Chicago.
He started in 2011.
I think he's doing alright, but the Bears are quick to get rid of coaches.
All of the NFL is quick to get rid of coaches.
Yeah, that's true. However, five years is a record for a Bears coach.
They aren't as bad as the Rams.
What did the Rams have three coaches in five years.
The Rams had four coaches in five seasons.
That sounds about right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think this year will be the year for the Washington Redskins?
I have lost my optimism a long time ago for the Washington Redskins.
Same here. I really wonder what it will take to the Washington Redskins around.
They have been a decent the past couple of seasons with Kirk Cousins.
They have been better, but they always seem to hit a wall.
Robert Griffin's first season was the Redskins was probably the last time I had hope in the team.
The Redskins were actually fun to watch when Griffin was on playing well!
I am not sure what happened to Robert.  I don't know why he can't replicate what he did back in 2012.
I think his injury during the wildcard game back in 2012 against the Seahawks is what started his downfall.
He was very athletic back then and that injury seemed to take something out of him in the years that followed.
I think the problem is that he needs more help on his fundamental skills.  He depends too much on his athletic ability.
That may have something to do with it.  I have some other ideas.
What are your thoughts?
Well, all the teams that he has been on seem to have a terrible offensive line.
You aren't wrong.
Both the Redskins and the Browns could not keep the pressure off of Griffin.  He never has enough time to sit back in the pocket.
Why do you think that Kirk Cousins seems to be doing better with the Redskins offensive line than Griffin?
I don't know.  From what I hear, players actually seem to like Kirk Cousins.
Did the Redskins players not like Griffin?
That is the rumour.  If it is true, that may be one of the reasons why the offensive line didn't put any energy into defending Griffin on the field.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best AFC team?
The Patriots
I agree
Who is second?
The Texans
That is a stretch, but I see where you're coming from
I like them a lot
Are you from Houston?
Yes
I see
My friend is  Dallas Cowboys fan.
Does he like Romo?
Yes
Romo is good, but last year he was not ready.
I think he will bounce back this year
I hope so
He is a great QB
I agree
Do you think the Texans have a shot this year?
Most definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite wide receiver currently in the league?
My favorite would have to be Odell Beckham Jr.
Really? I was expecting you to say someone else,
Who were you expecting me to say?
I don't know, maybe someone like Antonio Brown.
Antonio Brown might be the best right now, but he's not my favorite.
I just think Odell is too flashy.
That's exactly why I like him.
Okay, well, who is your second favorite?
Probably Julio Jones.
He's not better than Antonio Brown either.
Maybe not, but he's always good to me in fantasy football.
I guess those are okay players to have as your favorite.
What about you? Who is your favorite?
My favorite is obviously Antonio Brown.
Because he's the best?
Because he's the best!!
Okay, but, he's not very flashy.
He doesn't have to be flashy to be the best.
I guess so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the NFL  season start for 2017?
The 2017 NFL season starts September 7, 2017
What are the first teams playing?
The Chiefs are  at  the Patriots for the opening kickoff
Will I be able to see that on any main television station or do I need a cable or other pay subscription?
Actually , that game will be broadcast on NBC at 8:30 Eastern Standard Time
Which team do you favor?
I favor the New England Patriots
Why do you favor the Patriots?
I live in the New England are and I am a fan of the team.
Who is the quarterback this year?
Tom Brady is the Patriots quarterback.
I thought he was suspended from the game.
No, he was suspended for only a few games the last season in 2016.
Does anyone play for the Kansas City Chiefs that I may know?
Hopefully. The quarterback is Alex Smith.
Anyone else I might know that is a star type player?
Yes they have a star  receiver named  Tyreek Hill
How good is he?
Hill had an amazing rookie season and as a result he was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl as a return specialist
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember John Elway?
Yes, of course.
I remember his first Super Bowl
When was that?
Super Bowl XXI
Oh yeah, didn't they play the Giants?
Yes, and they lost.
Yeah, the Broncos tended to lose a lot of Super Bowls.
I think it was three losses before he finally won a super bowl.
Well he never had any good support with his team.
Where did they play that Super Bowl?
At the Rose Bowl
Oh yeah, they used to play there a lot.
Yes, before all the fancy new stadiums.
Yes, haven't played there for a long time.
Who won the MVP for that game?
Phil Simms.
Ah yes, good QB for the NY Giants.
Yes, now he does a lot of tv commentating.
Yes, nearly every Sunday during the season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Superbowl XIII.
Who played in that one?
Pittsburgh versus Dallas.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Terry Bradshaw for Pittsburgh and Roger Staubach for Dallas.
What was the point spread?
Pittsburgh was minus four.
Who scored first?
Pittsburgh, but Dallas answered with a touchdown.  7-7 at the end of the first quarter.
What was the halftime score?
Pittsburgh scored 14 points and Dallas  scored a touchdown to make it 21-14.
Who was in the halftime show?
A bunch of Caribbean bands.
What happened in the third quarter?
The only scoring was a Dallas field goal.
What the fourth?
Pittsburgh scored 14 straight points, but Dallas matched it.  Pittsburgh won by 3 points.
Exciting.  Who was the MVP?
Terry Bradshaw.
I like close SB games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Manning from the Colts, or Broncos better?
They are both great
But, if you had to pick one, which would you choose?
I would go with the Colts version
Me too
He had better numbers
And the Broncos had better defense
I remember those showdowns in the AFC against Brady
Those were epic for sure
Him and Brady are great rivals
Is he better than his brother?
Yes
I don't know. Eli had been more impressive
But Peyton has better numbers
They are both amazing
True
Which one had the better Super Bowl win?
I think the Giants win over the Patriots was the best
That's true. The Patriots were undefeated
And that game was one of the most exciting of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the Texans this coming season?
Yes and no.
Why no?
It's hard to get excited about Tom Savage being QB.
I feel you there.
I'm more excited about the future of the team with Watson under helm:
I think most of the city of Houston is.
Hopefully Watson starts next season and the defense still has a few years left.
That would be the perfect scenario.
I just want to see a Championship here in Houston.
Yeah. Even the Oilers could't bring one home.
Nope. Only been a NBA title here in Houston. We need something else!
Hopefully Clowney can have another great season.
I hope so. He was a best last season.
He made Tom Brady look like a rag doll in the playoffs.
One of the only bright spots in that game.
I wouldn't want him chasing me down!
Yeah, I'd be scared as heck.
Plus, Watt coming back this season?
Yeah I'm excited about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the league go to 18 games?
Not any time soon
Why do you think that?
I think the NFL Players association does not want it
But they would make more money
Right but they would be playing alot longer too
That would cut down on careers too
I think it would invalidate alot of records as well
Used to be 14 games and they upped it
And so the records are incomplete before then
We didnt live in an era of Social media either so it wasnt relevant
Brady would def break Mannings record if they did that
I dont know if anyone knows thats for sure
Yeah but hes already close then gets 2 more games? Take it to the bank.
So every record would get broken?
Probably a new role call would be made.
I love records to get broken so I am all about this
What about if it was your record about to be boken
Yeah I would be upset, the NFL and its PA always get their way though
Yeah they are a strong union
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you getting excited for the NFL Preseason?
I'll probably watch some, but I look forward to the real games.
Do you think anybody can stop the Patriots?
I keep expecting Tom Brady to show signs of his age, but it hasn't happened yet.
What's your favorite team?
The Chicago Bears.
How do you think they'll do this year?
They're still in rebuilding mode and I don't see them doing much this year.
What did you think of the Mitch Trubisky trade?
I absolutely hated it.
Why did you hate it?
I think they paid too much to get him and I think he'll be a bust.
Do you think they should start him right away or let him sit and learn?
I think they should let him sit and learn for part of the season, but he should eventually start.
Do you think that will be their strategy this season?
I think the Bears will try to avoid playing him, but I'm not sure they'll be able to avoid it.
Excluding the Patriots, who do you think could win the Super Bowl next year?
I know they collapsed against the Patriots, but I could see the Falcons winning it.
What makes you say that?
The collapse makes people forget how close they were to winning the Super Bowl. They're a good team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for a good Panther's season this year?
I don't know, Cam Newton has to really step his game up.
I feel like Cam Newton gets a bad rap.
I mean he is a showboat.
I guess for how good he is, he can gloat a little bit.
All ego aside, even when he was injured, he still played the game.
That's true, he's really dedicated.
Yeah, but he didn't give himself a chance to heal up.
That should be  a testament to how much he cares.
It seems a little selfish to me.
Why would you think that?
I mean, they have a stable of other players that could carry the team while he's out.
Is that fair to the rest of the team to keep the star player out?
Luke Kuechly could do just a good a job as Cam could and leading.
Yeah, but he would do the same thing.
Luke was out for weeks with a concussion, and he didn't feel the need to jump back in.
I didn't even notice.
That's the point, Cam could have stayed out and came back in at 100%
I guess you're right. Newton needs to mature a little bit.
He should stop getting hurt, period.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that contract that Derek Carr signed?
Yeah, but it wasn't all that surprising.
How is a record-setting contract not surprising?
Everyone knew that he'd get an elite contract as one of the top young QBs.
Do you think he's really proved enough, though?
Yeah, I mean, the injury was a total fluke, since he's been pretty healthy to this point.
But still, $25 million per year?
Salaries keep creeping up with the cap, plus it's not all guaranteed.
But do you really think he's better than Andrew Luck?
I'm surprised to say this, but yeah, he's been more consistent than Luck.
Luck has definitely put up gaudier stats.
Yardage-wise, definitely, but he hasn't been as efficient lately. Luck's had more picks and not more TDs.
I think it helps Carr in the red zone, though, having Amari Cooper instead of TY Hilton.
Maybe, but Cooper's young, and you'd think Luck would have more TD throws with that running game.
I don't think Frank Gore is that bad.
Come on, he used to be good, but he's running on fumes now.
Marshawn Lynch isn't a spring chicken, himself.
Yeah, that'll be interesting, but he's not being paid a ton, anyway.
So do you think the Raiders are legitimate contenders?
Yeah, but even I'm surprised how well that rebuild went, so maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so excited that pre-season football will be starting soon!
What QBs are you most excited about this year?
Tom Brady will still be awesome, but I think Aaron Rodgers is the best right now or Matt Ryan- geez he had an amazing run last year
Maybe, but honestly I was surprised by Sam Bradford on the Vikings last year. I thought he was done for.
Thats true- his stats were really good, especially with the terrible offensive line he had. But he just gets overshadowed because of all the previous team drama
True, but I never thought he would have a season like that after he left Philly
I'm excited about some of the newer QBs too- Dak Prescott and Carson Wentz in the NFC East both had amazing years for rookies
Yea, they were amazing. I'm also exited about Mariota and Winston
Yea they were hyped a lot, it will be interesting to see what kind of a season they have.
And of course you still have Andrew Luck, Eli Manning, Drew Brees, Russell Wilson...all veterans who could have amazing seasons again
Yea but what about the teams with terrible QBs? Goff was horrible, Hoyer is not good enough to be the starting QB for the 49ers.
At least they have a quarterback- who do the Jets have? Or the Browns?
Thats true- I don't even know- mayeb McGown for the Jets?
I would put him in the same boat as Hoyer- an acceptable backup but no way he can lead a team all season.
There are also some older QBs that may be on their way down
Yea, I think this season will be telling for quarterbacks like Ben Rothlesberger.
And Carson Palmer, and Eli Manning.
But who knows- Peyton Manning won the superbowl his last year when people thought he was done
True, but he wasn't playing at his previous elite level when he won.
But one of these experienced guys could do the same thing if they have the right players in place around them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could take any NFL team from any era which would you say is the best?
Thats a tough one. I can take a team from any year?
Absolutely.
I'd say 1985 chicago bears.
Really? Why the bears?
The team they assembled that year was perfect.
That statement sounds exaggerated.
It's not. They put together a perfect offensive and defensive line.
They didn't have a perfect season though.
They ended their season 15- 1.
Exactly, if they were so great the wouldn't of dropped a game.
The thing people fail to remember is their seasons tarted off badly.
I would say I', guilty of that fact.
I mean the only 5 teams out of the league managed to score more than 10 points on them. Their defense was that good.
I see your point. I still don't think they are the best.
Who would you pick?
I'd say the 1972 Dolphins.
Why bescause of their perfect record?
Exactly because of their perfect record.
I think their competion that year just wasn't up to par.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Only a few more weeks until we get some football back.
Yeah, it's only pre-season, but I'll take it.
Who is your team?
The Raiders.
You guys had a decent run last year.
Yeah, the regular season was really good, but the playoffs were a bit of a let down.
Yeah, what happened there?
Well first our starting QB got hurt right at the end of the season.
I forgot about that.
And then our backup QB was OK but our left tackle got hurt and we couldn't protect him.
That's brutal. I thought you guys had a real shot last year.
Well, we're going to be strong again this year.
Except that the Raiders have a really tough schedule this year.
Especially the last few weeks of the season.
Well, you'll still have a better season than my team.
Oh yeah, who's that?
The Los Angels Rams.
Yeah, they were pretty brutal last year.
I know, there's been so many changes in the off-season because there's so many things to fix.
Well, at least you've upgraded the head coach and defensive coordinator quite a bit. That should help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game last night between the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos?
No, I fell asleep. Was it a good game?
Yes, it was a highly competitive game.
Oh really, what was the final score?
The Broncos won the game 21-20.
How many total passing yards did Cam Newton throw for?
He had 194 total yards.
How many yards did Siemian throw for on the Broncos?
Siemian threw for slightly less at 178 yards.
Who led the Panthers in rushing yards?
The Panthers were led by Jonathan Stewart with 64 rushing yards.
How many carries did Stewart have?
Stewart had 15 carries.
Who was the Broncos' leading rusher?
The Broncos were led in rushing by CJ Anderson with 92 yards.
Did any team have any fumbles?
Yes, the Broncos had 1 fumble.
Who led the Panthers in receiving yards?
The Panthers were led by Kelvin Benjamin with 91 yards.
That's good. I think I recorded the game so I'll try to watch it when I get home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Cleveland Browns in the NFL?
Didn't Pat Schurmur, a former Michigan State Spartan, coach there a few years ago?
Yes, actually, I met him in person at a dinner once.
That's kind of cool. What did you think of him?
He was a really nice guy, but I had no idea he was coaching the Cleveland Browns.
Seriously? That's funny.
I heard him talking about playing at Michigan State and then asked him what he did after college.
What did you say??
I just said, I overheard him talking about playing football, and what was he doing now?
And, what did he say?
"I'm the coach of the Browns".   I was so embarrassed.
Well, you wouldn't have known if he was coaching the Browns, since you don't live in Cleveland.
Later, I found out that the locals weren't that impressed, because the Browns weren't doing well.
But how many people can say they met a head NFL Coach in person?
And, after a couple of years, he moved on become the Offensive coordinator and then interim head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.
So, I heard that he's moved on again to the Minnesota Vikings.
Yes, I think that happened in 2016.
And, I hear he's now the Offensive Coordinator with the Vikings
Yes, It looks like he's definitely more comfortable being an offensive coordinator vs. the head coach.
Well, hopefully, he does well for the Vikings!
XXXXXXXXXXX
DO you like the NFL?
Sure I do
Whats your favorite team
The Cowboys
The Dallas Cowboys are an excellent team. I love them. But how do you like the Steelers?
I feel that team is very weak now
For real? How come
I dont like the quarterback and their defense is lacking
So you think they need someone like Manning
Sure, thats exactly what they need
Im with you on that one
Your welcome
But what about the Patriots and Tom Brady, do you like them as well
No. I dont like them at all
Why?
Because of their huge ego
I see. I see.
I guess they are more than meets the eye, but its a truly hard situation for all of them
You feel its a loopsided team ha?
Yeah, Brady hover atop all of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think the cardinals will do something this season?
you mean arizona?
yeah?
man i doubt it.
why you say that?
carlson palmer can't win the big game.
what?
how many playoff wins does he have?
i don't know.
he has one playoff win.
was that with the bengals?
heck no. he got traded from the bengals because he couldn't win in the playoffs.
he has a win with arizona?
that one year when they beat the packers.
yeah that's right. and then got destroyed by carolina.
carolina beat them boys like they stole something.
didn't they beat them by like five touchdowns?
almost. they beat them by 34 points.
i think this may be palmer's year this season.
i doubt it. arizona are an after-thought.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My boss use to have Season Tickets to the Bucs.
Wow, that's cool.
Yes, especially when he use to give us the tickets to go to Pre-season games and games he could not attend.
No way! Really?
Yes, we use to go all the time. Box Seats too.
That's wild. What was it like?
Well, it was kinda underwhelmining.
How so?
Well, for "Box Seats" i thought they would be more lavish. it was just regular seating.
Really? I had no clue!
Me either. I thought it would have been like a Rays game.
How was the Rays seating?
Well, thicker, more comfortable seats for starters.
So the Baseball seats were better than the Football seats.
Yes, but we still had fun and the balcont seats just covered us if it rained.
Well, that's not so bad.
No, it was pretty cool.
I bet.
I'd like to go to a game this year, i keep putting it off.
Same here and we are so close, we should make a plan to do so this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Las Vegas getting an NFL team?
I think that's completely ridiculous. It should be put elsewhere.
Why?
Well that area already has the Cardinals, 49ers, and Rams, who JUST moved there.
Overkill?
A bit.
What about the city in general? Could it support a team?
Easily, surprisingly.  There's always a ton of tourists year-round so I doubt they'd have trouble filling seats.
Do you think it'll affect the nearby markets?
No, they will be fine. Football fans don't just change allegiances.
So where would you put a new team?
Any of the following: Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Des Moines, or Santa Fe.
Why those?
They're kind of in the middle of nowhere but far enough away from the Cowboys, Chiefs, and Vikings.
Do you think the population will support it?
Of course! If college sports are big there, the NFL will be too.
I have a different idea.
Shut down some teams and re-purpose the stadiums.
NO, no no no.
Ha, just kidding. The NFL will succeed anywhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Falcons can bounce back after that crushing Super Bowl loss?
Yeah, I think they'll use it as motivation to practice and play harder.
I think their defense will also be better.
They've added a lot of speed on defense. And having Poe in the middle of the line will be an improvement.
Yes, and they'll get Trufant back. That will take some pressure off the other defensive backs.
What do you think of the offensive coordinator situation? Do you think Sarkisian is as innovative as Kyle Shanahan was?
Sarkisian is unproven, but I've heard good things from a lot of insiders.
I blame Shanahan for the Super Bowl loss. I'm sort of glad to see him go.
Me, too. Run the ball and eat up clock when you're up 28-3!!!
I think Ryan will have a harder time this year. He's getting used to a new offensive coordinator, and the line is a little shakier than last year.
Yeah, they have to keeps a clean pocket for him to be effective. Especially on downfield throws.
If the line can keep the pocket clean for five seconds, Ryan will find someone open. They have so many good pass catching options.
Yeah, teams can't double Julio every play or the other receivers will burn them one on one.
If Julio stays healthy, this will be another special year for him and Ryan.
Julio is a beast when he's healthy, but he's had a lot of foot problems. I hope he's getting proper treatment and training to prevent foot injuries.
I think Arthur Blank really wants a championship in the inaugural season at the new stadium. If they don't make it back to the Super Bowl, I think he'll make major changes in the front office.
I think Quinn is safe as long as it's clear the team is listening to him, but Dimitroff is deservedly on the hot seat.
The front office has done a better job under Dimitroff the past couple of years, but they were lousy for the few years before that.
I'm surprised he kept his job so long after all those draft busts.
He's seemed to have added good front office personnel, and I think Quinn has helped selecting players, as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready to watch some football.
I always am I wonder who will take the win.
I think the Falcons will go far.
They did good last year.
I think the Cowboys will do good also.
They have some good young players.
I believe that team will go far and be good.
I do too.
I think that it is good they had their quarterback because of tony romo and him not being able to play.
Did he retire?
He was released.
Wow the cowboys released him?
Yeah they released him in April of 2017.
I wonder if he will retire.
After he was released he announced his retirement.
Wow I wonder what he will do.
He has a job now as a sports broadcaster.
That is good he is still involved in sports.
I agree he will be missed but the Cowboys will still do good.
Yeah they have amazing new players they will go far.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man?
What's good?
Not much, not much. You?
Ehhh, I'm hanging out there
So, what is happening right now?
Uhhh, not sure.
Let's go!
Where?
Where?
Uhhh
Not sure.
Same.
Let's do something creative!
Like what?
Maybe make a sign that says Super Bowl Champs!
Ummm... that's too generic.
What else can we do?
Not sure, depends.
Well, we gotta leave!
Sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the falcons
I love them
They have a great coach too
Whats his name again?
Dan quinn
Oh yea, hes pretty good
The quartback is amazing too
Which one?
Matt Ryan
Yea he is an awesome quarterback
They have a good lineup
They do
Julio jones is a pretty good wide reciever
Yea he is one of the best recievers
Exactly
Great team
I hope to see them in the superbowl soon
That would be amazing
It would
Hopefully soon
XXXXXXXXXXX
Patriots are team to beat until someone actually does beat them.
I can't believe the other 31 teams can't put something together to beat them when it matters.
Falcons were close in Super Bowl, but imploded in second half.
I and half the audience can't believe that happened!
That pretty much cements Tom Brady's place in Canton.
That is true, but he was already in before that game anyway.
You know what kind of sucks, is there are a lot of great players who have never won a ring.
That is true, but it seems that what people/voters get caught up in today are numbers.
I unfortunately agree.  Like receivers in today's game and probably in last 20 years are putting up outrageous numbers for stats because of the way the game has evolved.
It's hard to compare some of the greats of the 1960's & 1970's w/those of today because of those numbers.
I love the Raiders and think it's too bad Cliff Branch is not in the Hall.
You really think he is worthy.
Definitely, he was a home run threat, has career TD numbers that rival many of those that came after him, and many TV experts agree that he is Hall-worthy.
That probably is true, just wrong era in the game.
What about Cardinal great Jim Hart?
I don't know, he doesn't really have that 'wow' factor.
That's what I mean.  He played on very pedestrian teams in the same division as the Cowboys when they were perennial winners every year.
But did he ever do anything?
He was one of main reasons they were probably a competitive team some years.  He did this for over a decade in St. Louis with very few players that anyone who was not a die hard Cardinal fan can even name more than five of his teammates.  He was a pillar in that organization.
Obviously he was a little before my time.  I can respect his longetivity in an era when the NFL was much different than it is today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Yes i love it
Me too
Its my favorite sport
Its definitely my favorite sport.
I like the cowboys
They are a great team
I think they will make it to the superbowl
Me too
They have a lot of good players
I agree
And its definitely their turn to get to the superbowl
Yes it is
Its been 20 years
Yes they are definitely due
It would be nice to see them in it
I agree
Well it was good talking to you
You too
Bye
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are your Bengals looking this season, man?
Oh, I think they could win it all!
Marvin Lewis better hurry up and produce some results, I know that much.
Yeah. I think it's time to move on after this season.
What sucks is that they almost ALWAYS make it to the playoffs.
Yeah. I love Dalton. I think he's underrated.
Me too, actually. Him and Stafford.
Oh, definitely. Stafford has a cannon on him.
How do you think the Lions will do this year?
I think they're in the same boat as the Bengals, as far as head coaches go. They need to start producing results.
Definitely. They need some good receivers too.
With no Megatron, it's like... what's the point?
Yeah. And the Bengals need someone to supplement Green.
I know, right!? We need someone who can be in the slot and create mismatches.
Like a Christian McCaffrey, right?
Exactly. Or like a Dion Lewis.
Bengals defense should still be decent, if not better, though.
No doubt. As long as we have a monster like Burfict, we should be decent at a minimum.
I agree. Well, I'll see you once the season starts.
Me too. I'm excited for some football!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If the team can get a solid start from BG it could really help set the table for a quick learning curve by Davenport, who in his own right is a pretty smart cookie.
I'm a firm believer that Mancz earned the starting OC job based on last years production.
He was the most consistent producer on the OL during the season.
He's learned the calls and most of all, he had to help carry poor play at both G spots for the majority of the season.
Su'a-Filo finally came on towards the end of last season, giving me a lot of hope that the light finally went on for him and 2017 could be his arrival season.
RG never gave Mancz a break...he helped cover the weak RG and the TE's had to help cover the weak RT. For this reason, I would roll the dice with Martin learning the RG job from the very start of the off-season program.
BG, like Brown brings the veteran savvy to the comers which could finally help solidify this OL.
There will be plenty of bodies competing for backup spots and this could finally be on track to a decent and confidence building season.
I like the idea of Martin being protected by Mancz and Giacomini during his rookie season.
I would like to see Foreman become the feature back and Miller be the backup...or change of pace guy
Miller played a little heavier last season to compensate for the amount of carries he would be responsible for and he didn't do too bad.
but he had his limitations.
I'd like to see Miller drop 15 lbs. and be a scary good 2nd or 3rd down back where his ability to get outside and catch the ball would have to be accounted for by opposing defense's.
Foreman would finally bring a dynamic to. The red--zone that this team has.
Sorely missed since the AF days.
Ervin holds onto the RB4 spot. If the OL is better, this group could really help the QB's.
TE's could get better if thei job was to play a traditional position and not have to be the extra blocker covering for a weak right side.
I like this receiving group and feel like the team needs to find a way to utilize. Wendell. Williams. He is my sleeper on this offense.
He's mediocre to me because he hasn't done anything.
Dude hasn't thrown a TD yet. How in the world is that good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Well I love my Bills!
Me too!
I'm glad that they're changing things up
as in getting rid of Rex?
Yea
Did you think that he was the problem?
Definitely
Why's that?
Well he's in charge, right?
Kind of...
Well he's the guy making the final calls
But was it the calls that were bad?
It doesnt matter
What do you mean?
The buck starts and stops with him
True, but he's then just a scape goat
Could be..
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which LA Team are you rooting for this upcoming NFL season?
Chargers. The Rams are done.
Chargers are AFL.
That was back in 1970. They've been NFL since.
Woa. I guess the Rams better get their act together.
Coach Fisher got axed last season. That should help.
Who is the Chargers' coach.
The Chargers coach is Anthony Lynn. He used to play in the American League and he doesn't mess around.
Which stadium are they going to play at?
Well, first off, the Chargers only have a 1 year approval to relocate. They are required to negotiate with the Rams on a new stadium.
Well, the Rams aren't going anywhere then.
They're supposed to be joining the Rams at the new Inglewood Stadium.
I think an inter-conference game -- Chargers against the Raiders would be awesome.
Not so fast, the move has some restrictions. The Chargers won't be able to play road games against the Broncos or the Raiders.
What?!??!
Now the Chargers are considered beneficiaries of league scheduling policy. Rules are rules.
Well, the Rams better get their stuff together for sure.
The Chargers have better fans. They have their own mobile app that streams their games.
They could very well take over LA.
Well, the Raiders filed paperwork to move to LA too, can you imagine having 2 NFL teams and 1 AFL team in Los Angeles?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wiill you be watching and NFL games this season?
You know that it a crazy question, I will be infront of that tv.
Who you do you think will take it this year?
I'm thinking that the Giants will pull it off.
Are you serious? I'm thinking that Washington Redskins will have a good chance this year.
Why do you think that, do you know something I don't?
Not really, I just know that nothing is impossible with any team.
Well from the perdictions I read recently, the Redskins are in poor shape.
Like what have you heard?
According to Bovada, the Redskins chances of winning the next Super Bowl come in at 50-1.
Get out of here; that is just their opinion.
Don't take it so bad, eight other teams have worse odds than the RedSkins, ha ha.
I'm not taking it bad, I just can't believe your letting perdictions persuade your outlook on the team.
No, I'm just trying to get under your skin, in a teasing way. Nothing serious.
Not taking it to heart. But, I will say this, I think Redskins will prove those perdictions wrong.
Well stay positive, because that is what a diehard fan does.
Believe me, I'm sticking with my team, been a fan through the good and the bad.
I have to say, it is the same here. I never thought of rooting for another team; just the Giants.
Well good luck to you.
Thanks and good luck to you too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think Tom Brady is gonna be able to win another Super Bowl?
Nah, I don't think so.
Really? He still looks pretty good and healthy.
I just think that he gets carried by his team too much and never really plays a great Super Bowl where he dominates.
Yeah, I guess I can see that. But if you think about it, it really is all about being part of a great system.
I agree. I think Tom Brady is getting to that point though where the system can't help him anymore.
You do have to admit though, he still played great last year.
Yeah, but a year is a long time for a professional football player. For all we know his body can break down soon.
Maybe, but then again, if you think about it, he didn't even have Gronk in the Super Bowl and they still won.
I think the Super Bowl win was more of a matter of the Falcons making stupid decisions.
Yeah, it is odd that the Patriots won their last two Super Bowls off of stupid choices by the other teams.
Do you think he should still continue playing?
Yeah, I think he's still their best choice at quarter back.
I actually think the back up Jimmy is a better choice.
Yeah, I think he's pretty good, too.
I actually think they should start him soon and cut Brady because Jimmy is about to become a free agent.
I don't think that would happen. New England fans would riot.
Yeah, but when Jimmy gets signed by another team and does better than Brady, they're going to wish they had kept him.
Yeah, that would be funny.
I definitely would love to have Jimmy as the quarterback on my team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Vikings offensive line will be better this season?
Well they have Riley Reiff and Mike Remmers now so that should help a lot.
Reiff is a definite upgrade for the team.
Absolutely and they should be able to better protect their quarterback with a stronger line.
They were really weak at that last season. That's probably what led to a lot of their losses.
They're lucky Bradford wasn't injured they way he was getting sacked.
Well they also got Pat Elflein in the third round which should help.
They have put a lot of money into the team but they really didn't have a choice if the want to be competitive.
True and Bradford got sacked 37 times last season so they have to try to fix whatever the issue is there.
Do you think they will use all three as starters?
Reiff is definitely a starter and it looks like Remmers will be as well.
I think Elflein will have to prove himself as a backup first though.
Probably because he isn't well known and hasn't had any time in the NFL.
I would like to see their offensive line catch up with the talent of their defense.
Reiff working with Matt Kalil should make for a very strong offensive line.
As well as superior protection for their quarterback which is necessary.
Do you think T J Clemmings will be replaced?
More than likely after all of the sacks Clemmings allowed last year.
Well if their offense improves it will make for some interesting competition in the NFC.
As long as they can keep these guys healthy they should be in good shape.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Summer training is about to start. Are you ready for football
Yes! I can't wait for another season!
What is your favorite part about NFL?
I love all the tailgating and parties to watch.
Yeah. There is always great food at those events.
Don't forget there is never a shortage of drinks!
Very true. It is also cool to see everyone come together to cheer on their team.
Even the die hards, ticking with their team even during loosing streaks
Yeah. The are the true fans.
Not the bandwagon fans
I also like watching the commercials during the games
Those can be really funny.
Any plan for going to games this year?
Yeah, I already have tickets for 3 home game, and an away one.
Good excuse to get away for a weekend.
Yeah, very. It is a surprise for my boyfriend.
Is he a big NFL fan?
Yes. Huge fan.
Very nice. He will enjoy that.
I hope so!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How Rex Ryan getting the boot again.
Yea,I know.
I think he's done as a head coach.
I do too.
I,always thought he was overrated.
Even as a defensive coordinator?
Yes because he had some players with Baltimore.
I can't argue with that.
So will the Bills be better without him?
I think they have to be.
You mean addition by subtraction?
That's what I mean.
They hired Sean McDermott right?
Yes they did.
He's gets to lead a rebuilding team.
That he does.
I,don't think they're in full rebuild mode.
No not full but close.
Outside of New England the afc east is weak.
Yes,I agree with that.

The star is the Dallas Cowboys logo.
They were first in the Western Conference.
Then they were in the Easter Conference starting 1960.
They were in the Capital Division for 2 years.
Their uniform is Blue and White.
Sometimes it is Navy Blue or Silver.
Their mascot is Rowdy.
Jerry Jones owns the team.
CEO is Stephen Jones.
Jerry Jones is also President of the team.
I think he is also general manager.
Head coach is Jason Garrett.
I think he used to be a foot ball player.
He played for several teams.
Yes. Like about 8 teams.
Dallas Cowboys nickname is America's Team.
Also The 'Boys.
Or some call them Big D.
When they don't play well they are called The Dallas Cowgirls.
That would be rough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team is the best this year?
In what sport?
Football
Oh, The Patriots for sure.
That is what I thought you said.
They are the champs
Yeah, but the Falcons blew it
That does not matter
It does. The Falcons are the best
Are you a Falcons fan?
Yes
Why do you like them?
I am from Atlanta
They have a shot, but the NFC is deep
I hear you
I think the Packers and Cowboys are better
They will give them a run for their money
Cowboys are healthier and the Packers are always good
We will see what happens
Yes we will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Cleveland Browns.
They had a rough season.
Tell me about it. They only won one game.
Do you think they will be better this year?
They should be a lot better. They signed some good free agents and had a good draft.
Who did they take in the first round of the draft this year.
They drafted three players, Myles Garrett, David Njoku, and Jarbill Peppers.
Those guys were all very good in college.
Hopefully they are good enough to help turn the team around.
Have they found their quarterback yet?
I sure hope so.
Who do you think will start at quarterback for them this year.
I think it's between Cody Kessler and Deshone Kizer.
Deshone Kizer went to Notre Dame, didn't he?
Yes he did. The Browns took him in the second round.
Who do you think their best player is?
I would say that it would have to be Joe Thomas.
He has been there for a very long time.
It's hard to believe, but he has never missed a game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think Johnny Maziel was such a bust?
I think the guy had some talent but he was way too interested in partying and not improving himself in the game.
Do you think the browns gave up on him too quickly?
No, if anything I think the Browns stuck with him for too long. It was evident that this guy was a cancer.
I really think he might have succeeded if he had been drafted by another team.
I agree that the browns did him no favors by drafting him but I don't think there would have been any difference if he went to a different team.
You could put almost any quarterback behind the browns offensive line and they wouldn't be able to move the ball.
True. However, Manziel was way too short for the game and he was too big of a kid.
He won the Heisman though. He's got to have some talent.
There were some flashes of hope with him. Maybe if he were to clean up his act, he could have gotten better.
Do you think he will ever get back to the NFL?
I kind of doubt it. Maybe one day a team will take a chance on him as a backup.
I think a team might grab him sooner than you think.
I doubt it. It would have happened by now.
Yes, but teams situations are always changing along with their needs.
I don't think anyone is going to take a risk on him after all of the goofing off he has already done.
Why do you think the browns took a chance on him?
At that time, it wasn't as much of a risk. The guy looked much more appealing because he had just won a heisman.
I think Haslem regrets drafting him
He has openly admitted to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like in the NFL this year?
Man, the Patriots are tough but they can't win it every year!
I like the Cowboys to get to the Superbowl.
I don't know. Dak Prescott had a great rookie season, but opponents started figuring him out late in the season.
Maybe, but he's young and has time to develop.
I guess but if you keep in in the pocket his accuracy is poor.
I think the NFC East is the strongest division. The winner probably comes from those teams.
The Redskins will be okay if they're able to sign their QB Cousins.
They're kind of in a similar situation with the Cowboys. Is their defense strong enough?
Also, their offensive line is inconsistent.
Eagles? Good young QB and a strong defense!
I could see them doing well. They signed Alshon Jeffrey from the Bears this off season. He had 80 catches for Chicago recently.
I just don't see the Eagles doing much. They lost their two starting cornerbacks to free agency and I think they'll start two rookies.
Plus, Carson Wentz seems to be struggling with his throwing mechanics. He may not blossom at QB.
That leaves the Giants. Eli Manning already has two SuperBowl rings!
Yeah, but he throws too many interceptions and he's, well, old, aged, past his prime.
Eli didn't have a great year last year - not much talent on offense other than Beckham - but he averaged over 400 yards passing and had 25 touchdowns.
He will have a little more talent surrounding him this year. And the Defense was in the Top 5.
Hmm, tough to say. Hope somebody other than New England wins it.
Yeah, I'm tired of hearing all the talk of Brady being the Greatest of All Time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you a big fan of football?
Yes I am, but it is hard being a fan of my team!
What team is that?
The Vikings! They always get so close and then choke in the playoffs!
Wow that is harsh, I remember they started off strong last year and fell off. At least your team is hosting the Super Bowl this year!
Yea that is nice, I sure hope the Vikings are in the Superbowl as well though. What is your favorite team?
I am actually a huge cheesehead and love the Packers!
Oh no our favorite teams are rivals! But I respect how well your organization is run.
Thanks for that, I hate it when people take their fandom too seriously.
I agree it really ruins the fun of sports.
We also both got to enjoy the greatness that is Brett Favre!
Yea his two years here were the most fun I have had watching the Vikings since the Randy Moss years!
It was weird watching him play and beat the Packers up but I agree it was amazing to see him have such great seasons at the twilight of his career.
Weird? Don't you mean great! Haha at least we aren't Patriots fans right?
Oh man you can say that again. Remember how great the 2007 season was when they lost in the Super Bowl?
I do! That was such an amazing game. They are such a good team and I respect them but I can't help but root for them to lose.
Exactly! I can't believe the Giants beat them. What was your favorite part of the game?
It was easily David Tyree's leaping one-handed catch. That was amazing!
I remember standing up and cheering in the bar I was at when that play happened! Wow Eli Manning had a great game in that Super Bowl!
Yea he is a pretty good quarterback, but I think we both agree he isn't as good as the legend Brett Favre!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the Philadelphia Eagles started in 1933?
Really? I thought it was much later.
No the NFL tea started in 1933 as the Eagles, In 1943 changed their name to the Steagles.
The Steagles?????
Yes but that only lasted for one year then it was back to the Eagles.
They were bought for 25000 I heard.
yes. They ahd a great season in the forties as well.
Wow.
In the fifties they were not too great though and have had their ups and downs through the years.
Yes I guess so.
I guess all NFL teams have that happen.
Yea it has happened to the best, the Steelers, the Cowboys and others.
Did the Eagles ever win a superbowl game.
Yes they did a couple of times.
I would love to go to the Superbowl.
Me too.
Tickets are probably a 1000 bucks for that.
Most likely. Nothing is cheap anymore.
Well  guess I could save the money.
Probably, maybe we can go together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
HOw many SUperbowls did the Cowboys win?
I think they won five in total.
Wow, that is a lot.
Yup, I think they are the second highest team.
I remember they did win two Superbowls in two years.
They must have been ecstatic.
And rich.
Was that under Tom Landrey?
Not sure, great coach though.
He really was.
Yea but I think the new owner of the team fired him in 1989.
I guess they needed some new blood.
And new game plays too.
Well, I liked him.
I know they won the Superbowl in 92, 93 and 95 under th enew owner,
Well they are a great team no matter who is coaching I think.
Me too.
They have had some really good players over the years.
yea they have.
Great team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is one of the highest paid quarterbacks in the NFL
James Harden is one of the highest paid quarterbacks.
What team does he play for ?
He plays for the Houston Texans
What is he being paid?
He received a contract for $170 million dollars
How long is that contract for?
That is over a four year period.
Are these contracts all guaranteed money?
No, unlike the NBA, contracts in the NFL are not guaranteed.
What does that mean
It means that one very important part of any NFL contract is the guaranteed money part of the contract.
Can you given an example
yes, the contract for Andrew Luck is a good example
What is his position
He is the quarterback
How much did he get
He got a contract for $140  million dollars but only $87 million is guaranteed
So what happens if a team releases a player before the end of the contract term?
The team only has to pay the guaranteed part of the contract.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is hosting the Super Bowl this coming season?
They are actually having it in Minnesota.
Minnesota? Are you kidding me?
Yes, they have a new dome!
Really? When was that built?
I think it was just built for the Vikings this past year.
That's great, but I really love an outdoor NFL game.
Me too, especially in the snow.
Yes, I think those are the best football games.
I don't think any games should be played in a dome.
Not even when it's 20 below zero?
Not even then!
Football is such a brutal sport, they should be able to withstand the weather.
Well, I think the players can, it's just the fans can't.
True fans will withstand the weather.
I think there is some good to come from having a dome.
Yes, probably good if you want to take kids to the game.
Yes, my kids love the games but it can get so bitterly cold that we have to leave.
Yes, probably eventually all NFL teams will play in a dome.
It seems like that is the trend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football is an exciting sport.
I loved playing football when I was little.
Me too.
We played two-hand touch when we were really little and then flag football.
Yeah, us too.  Then we progressed to tackle football.
I'm so glad that I played.
Me too. It's a great sport.
Do you think the pros started out in flag football?
I don't know, but they definitely know how to play rougher than that.
I'm so glad we can still play flag football as adults.
Yes, my body couldn't handle being tackled now and I love the sport
Anything high intensity and rough is so fun to watch.
I can't wait to see the match-up tonight between the Steelers and the Ravens.
Me too.
Do you think the Steelers will win?
Maybe, but the Ravens have a strong defense.
The Steelers are strong on offense, though.
Yeah, I think Brown will get some TD's.
I hope so.  I'd like the Steelers to win.
Not me, I'm for the Ravens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL player really defied expectations last year?
I don't think anyone expected Dak Prescott to do as well as he did
And to lead the Cowboys into the playoffs with a legitimate chance at the Superbowl, too
I do think he had a lot of help from his teammates, but it's still impressive
And if he hadn't done as well as he did, Tony Romo may not have retired
I feel bad that Tony Romo never got the recognition that he deserved
But then again, maybe it's the other players on the team that make both Prescott and Romo look good
I guess it's hard not to do well when you have Jason Witten and Dez Bryant on your team
That makes sense when the team does noticably better when Dez is healthy
But either way, Prescott was set up to be a backup to Tony Romo, not take over the team as a rookie
True, but they didn't have much of a choice when it was between him and Mark Sanchez
Was that who it was? It's so hard to keep track of where Sanchez is these days
He wasn't that bad of a player, but I don't think he'll ever live down the butt fumble
If I were him, I would laugh along with it until it wasn't a joke anymore
And there hasn't really been anything since then to distract from it, despite some bad plays over the years
I remember seeing Desean Jackson try to reverse field and run back a kick or a punt, only to lose a ton of yards
Can you blame someone for trying something that worked so well for him in the past?
Maybe not, but as a player you still have to know when to take chances like that or just cut your losses
It's easier for players to take the 25 yards for a touchback when most don't return it that far
Well that may be but I still don't like that rule change, 20 yards was plenty before
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
I think the Patriots are going to win it all again.
No way, how can you say that?
Tom Brady
What about him?
Greatest QB ever.
Nah, Joe Montana was better.
Tom has more rings
Yeah, but Joe was undefeated in Super Bowls
I guess that's true, but Tom is more reliable
Do you mean durable?
Yeah, that's what I meant
Well that's because he's playing in the modern era
I don't understand what you mean
He has more help with nutrition and working out, etc.
I don't think that has anything to do with it.
Sure it does. Technology and science have improved since the 80s
Well I still think Brady is the GOAT
I have to disagree with you on that one.
Believe what you want, I know I'm right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Bills chances?
No chance at all.  They have a good defense and rushing but not much else.
Yeah, they need to keep with a coach for maybe five minutes.
Yeah, every time you change systems it makes playing harder.
Especially against a team that's have the same coach for nearly two decades.
Yeah, have fun beating the Pats.
Bills also need a QB.  I'm not on board with Tyrod Taylor.
Truthfully me neither.  Overrated.
They are stuck in that dreaded middle.
I see where you're going.  Not good enough to move forward, too good to get good picks.
Yeah, free agents don't see them as worthy, and drafting in the middle so they can't get those franchise players.
Yeah, they need to draft better too.
Start with finding a good quarterback.
Yes, a pocket passer might be nice.
And can you believe they let Hogan get away?
Oh I know.  Now he's living it up on the Pats.
He's a monster out there.
That's what happens when you have a good QB throwing to you.
I agree, Brady makes a difference.
And a deep receiving corps.  When everyone is doubling Gronk or Eddleman you're always wide open.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season!
Who's your favorite team?
I like the Vikings.
Wow, it's been a rough life for you.
Yes, but that's in the past.
You think this is their year?
Well, not sure about the Superbowl yet.
But you think they will improve.
I know they will.
Do you think they can win the North division?
Without a doubt.
What about Green Bay?
They are in decline.
What about the Lions?
Well, they look good, but they are the Lions.
I won't even ask about the Bears.
Yea, the Bears are a joke.
Who is your favorite Viking of all time?
I love Fran Tarkenton.
I love Cris Carter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the best NFL running back this year?
Ezekiel Elliott will be the best running back for sure.
No way, he is too young and inexperienced, maybe in a few years.
He may be young, but I think even though he is young he still has a lot of talent.
You are just saying that because you went to Ohio State and are loyal to their football players.
True, I am loyal, but I honestly think that he is one of the best out there. His abilities are second to none.
What about Le’Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers?
Sure, he has the most average yards per carry, but he doesn't have the skills that Elliott has. Plus he's been injured recently.
What skills does Elliott have that are so impressive?
Ezekiel Elliott is fast, no one can catch him.
Well it takes more than that, you have to be strong, and have experience.
Elliott is also very quick, have you seen how he can navigate through a tiny opening right down the middle?
He has a good team backing him up, so it is not all of his ability.
Eliott can jump over players, even when they are standing up. That is all his own ability.
I will admit that he has some incredible ups, but jumping alone won't do it, this isn't basketball.
True, but it makes him exciting to watch.
You don't win football games just by being exciting.
Maybe not, but the crowd loves it, and the energy helps them to win, so maybe it helps.
Well we'll just have to see, my money is on Bell, you keep rooting for your Buckeye guy.
I will, and my guy will jump right over your guy for the win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know when the preseason games start?
I do not but my  husband is already talking about it.
Are you guys going to any games this year?
Not to sure we might try for a preseason since they are cheaper.
Everyone in your household likes a different team right
Yes but the kids just pick opposite of my hubby to irritate him.
Most kids do
I know but he loves his Saints and i love rubbing it in that my Steelers have 6 superbowl win.
He was so disappointed last year when the Steelers went to the playoffs.
Yes iremember since his Saints lost again.
So i shouldnt bring up any information about the Patriots eigther.
Oh no he hates Bill Bellicheck
Why does he hate them so much i dont think they even play the Saints.
Thet dont he says Bellicheck is a cheated and Tom Brady gets handed everything.
Did you hear where Tom Brady had hihand on the Pens Stanley cup
Yes my hubby flipped about that he said Brady was jinxing the Pens
It was all over Twitter Steelers fans and Pens fans were outraged.
Yes i saw it on my page.
You and i should go to a Steelers game without the boys
That would be fun no men complaining just us girls having a sports night out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of year are the Colts going to have, you think?
Not sure. I don't keep up much with AFC.
They've got Andrew Luck.
Isn't he the highest paid player, or was?
I think so maybe.
You know, I used to think he was really slow but it turns out he's pretty fast.
I thought the same thing. I thought he was a real plodder.
Get a good pass rush on him and he was toast.
But I think I heard he runs like a 4.4 forty.
That's pretty good. Faster than a lot of QBs.
Faster than Tom Brady.
Yeah, old man Brady. I got to say the guy is good even if I don't like him much.
I guess it's human nature to root for the underdog and Brady's no underdog.
What do you think of Belichick as a coach?
I kind of feel about him the same way I feel about Brady.
I know what you mean.
I admire him and I think he's a great coach but I can't cheer for his team.
It's like they don't need cheering for.
Yeah, like a machine, a winning machine. Hard to cheer for a machine.
I heard that. I'm with you, man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really getting excited for the Bills season
Oh you're crazy, no way do they do anything relevant
Im not sure with a new front office they could have a chance this year
It's not possible it's not like they got any better on the field.
They got healthier, another season with Tyrod Taylor and a new coach could open up the game the way it should be.
Nope not a chance, You honestly think they can contend in their division?
Well I certainly think they are better than the Jets.
Ok, who isnt better than the jets? But really Patriots, Dolphins?
The fins are terrible they haven't done anything relevant in years.
Ok, so the patriots?
Well you're not going to really compete with them, you just need to beat them once at least.
And you think that can happen? They got even better
Sure, but any given sunday right?
What does that even mean? The patriots are so steady and never miss a step
well true but its not like they are unstoppable. Maybe if brady gets hurt or something
Haha, Maybe but Garrappolo is certainly capable
True he did manage to get them through a few situations in the past.
Yeah and hes going to be the next Brady, just watch
That would be the most patriots thing to happen
Yep exactly they never miss a beat, its just next man up with those guys
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Yes
Me too
Its the worlds best sport
I got the nfl sunday ticket just so i could see any game
Is it worth it?
Definitely
I would love to get it
You would like it
I probably would
It shows all games
Whoever you want to see?
Yes exactly
That sounds great
It is
Im going to get it
You wont regret it
Thanks
No problem
Nice talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot wait for the NFL season to start.
I know. I am sick and tired of watching baseball.
Who is your pick for this year?
I am going for the Pittsburgh Steelers again.
Why would you choose the Steelers? Rothlisberger is a wash.
Yes. It is true that he is getting old. But, I believe he still have some tricks up his sleeve.
The best quarterback in the league is still Tom Brady, in my opinion.
Tom Brady is an old man there is new blood in the league and he is no longer the king of passing yards.
Ok, smart guy. Who do you think is going to be the best quarterback this year?
Is that even a question? Aaron Rodgers is the man.
Does he really have the team to produce this year?
He still has Davnte Adams who had a great year last year. So I would say so.
Did Randall Cobb get traded?
Nope. He is still a Packer.
Is Clay Matthews still on the Packers line up?
Yes. Of course he is. He is easily their best linebacker.
Even after all this Packer talk your still a Steelers man?
I will always be a Pittsburgh man.
Well with Antonio Brown and Jason Harrison its easy to see why you love the Steelers.
Yes, they are truly a one of a kind team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Marshawn Lynch is flat out a great player. He's tough to lose.
Its Marshawn Lynch we're talking about. He's like 30.
You know, but if he can still play, he can still play.
Do you know any runningbacks that are actually successful into their 30s?
Theres some, but most just fizzle out.
Yea, I agree! Maybe Marshawn will be an exception, but I do not know.
Yea, I'm kinda tired of his act, but he's a great player.
Yea, what is with him and that. Is something wrong.
Well, he's socially awkward, but I think he is illiterate.
Yea, he very well might be. Something is weird there.
For that reason alone, the Seahawks will be okay without him.
Nobody needs somebody like that in the locker room regardless of how good they are.
What are you Chip Kelly? We saw in Philly that doesn't work.
Touche. You are right about that one.
Yea, talent trumps everything else in this league. Its been proven.
I agree! Its still professional football at the end of the day.
Yea, sometimes its tough to separate their personal lives, but sometimes its necessary.
Yea, I agree. At the end of the day, the most important thing is whether or not they can play.
Yea, that is extremely important.
That is obviously what wins and loses football games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about the Patriots?
Well, you can either love them or hate them.
And which group do you belong in?
Well, they have been doing really well. That come back was insane.
Yes! It was! I thought that game was the Falcon's.
It was unprecedented.
No matter what people say. Tom Brady is the best.
Well, I will have to argue you about that.
Oh, are you one of those people who hate him because of the deflation thing?
No. I just don't think Tom Brady is the best.
So who then?
Have you seen the arms of Aaron Rodger?
Yep, all of that Hail Mary play.
What about Drew Brees and his leadership.
One of the best.
Can't count Peyton Manning out? Come back after a year and win the Super Bowl to end his career.
You are right, he was great while he last.
See. Tom Brady is not the best player.
Well have any of those players ever win 5 super bowls and come back from a 28-3 deficit?
You got me there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The chargers are moving
They are? to where?
To LA
What? I thought the rams were in LA
They are going to both play in LA, and they are going to the same stadium
That's crazy. They leave San Diego to share a stadium?
It's going to be a nice stadium
Yeah, but why leave SD
They wanted a new stadium and SD wouldn't pay
That sucks, so no more football in SD
I guess not
That makes me sad
Why is that?
I liked the chargers as a San Diego team, made them feel special
But now they might get more attention
not under the rams shadow
you think
yeah, i do. the rams will take all the attention
what we ganna do?
I'm ganna go blog, its all I can do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite NFL team?
The Cleveland Browns.
They're pretty bad how can you still be a fan?
I'm still a fan because I live in Cleveland and I'm loyal.
Must have been hard last season when you barely one 1 game.
A win is a win and you get them where you can.
Do you think they have a chance to win it all this year?
Maybe not this ear but definitely years to come.
Who do you think wins it this year?
The Patriots because there really isn't a better team right now.
And they always get an easy schedule.
This may be Tom Brady's last season so he's got nothing to lose.
I think he's got a few more years left in him.
Who do you think will win it all?
The Cowboys or the Green Bay Packers.
Smart choice.
I don't want to see Tom Brady win another championship.
I think it would be great for his legacy.
He'd already the greatet he just needs to retire.
You have got a point there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who's your favorite player of all time?
Mine is Walter Peyton.
#34 for the Chicago bears -- one of the greatest of all time.
And he played for one of the greatest teams of all time too.
The 1985 Super Bowl Winning Chicago Bears.
Yep, coached by Mike Ditka.
And Jim McMahon was quarterback. I remember him being sort of a bad boy. Always wearing a headband and sunglasses.
And so many lineman on that team too who went on to make the Hall of Fame.
I remember Richard Dent, Mike Singletary...
And don't forget "Refrigerator" Perry! he was such a character.
Do you also remember the Super Bowl Shuffle?
Yeah, that was everywhere at the time. I used to have it memorized.
In the modern day game, who's your favorite running back?
That's tough. So many great players. I'm a Colts fan though so I'd have to say Robert Turbin.
Good pick. He's not flashy like others, but gets the job done.
Agreed. Even though the Colts had a rough season, he did his part and got the TDs and yards when needed.
Let's hope they can get their stuff together for next season. They were pretty pitiful last year.
Yeah, seems like we've either been on or off since we let Manning go. Either do pretty decent or terrible.
It's tough to be a Colts fan.
Especially when Brady keeps winning Super Bowls!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the draft begin anyway?
It began in 1936.
How did that go?
Well,when the professional football first began, players went to the winningest team, best place to live. etc
So draft was to fix that?
Well not so much fix the player's p-references, but the poor smaller teams had no way of getting out of their slump
That woudl make a lot of sense
Yep, so Bert Bell, who owned Eagles at the time, suggested to the owners that they make a pool of the players
Oh, and then select the players from worst team to first team order?
Yep. That woudl always give the first pick to the worst team in theleague
Which would improve the team
Yes. which is why at the level of the NFL, the teams are so evenly matched.
That's why predicting NFl games is so dificult.
Precisely.
I can predict college football pretty good
Totally different settings. The CFB and NFL. No startegy you use in the CFB will work in the NFL
So the other owners didn't hve problems with that idea apparently?
no. it passed unanimously
There's a funny story about all that.
What's that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you her, Terrell Davis is going to be in the Hall of Fame this year?
Really? Wow. He deserves it.
Yeah, i think that's a good call.
Where is the Hall of Fame located?
Oh, in Canton i believe.
Ohio?
Yes, in Ohio.
Have you ever been there?
No, i've always wanted to go tho.
Me too, that would be a cool trip.
Well, yeah but what else is there to do in Canton Ohio?
Haha, i'm sure there has to be SOMETHING there.
Well, Akron is near by.... didn't they make blimps?
Oh yeah, that's right.
So i guess we can hit the NFL Hall of Fame and possibly the Blimp Museum.
I'm not sure i could sell my wife on that one.
Haha, true, i guess we would have to research to see what else is there.
I would like to go to the Hall of Fame tho.
Me too, lets look into this.
Flights gotta be cheap to Akron.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how are you feeling about the upcoming nfl season?
I feel good and am ready to play.
do you think that the injury you experienced in the off season will inhibit your play this year?
No, I feel like I am fully healed and ready to get on the field.
How has the hamstring injury and recovery changed your approach to the season?
I am more aware of my surroundings and who is on my back guarding me so I don't pull it again.
Have you changed your workout routine because of it?
Yes, I make sure that I do extra stretches now to make sure it's worked oout before game time.
What has gotten through the off season injury?
My family's support and great rehabilitation doctors who made sure I was healing at a normal, healthy pace.
What are you most looking forward to this game?
I just want to go out and show the fans and the team that I am ready to go and good as new
do you anticipate any struggles facing the Bengals tonight?
Well, they are a tough team but we are definitely tougher!  I think it'll be a challenge, but one we will win!
Talk a little about the addition of the new linebackers.  Do you think they will be a good mesh with the team?
During practice they show they are fierce and loyal.  We mesh well as a team and are ready to play
That's great to hear!  Is there any team that you aren't looking forward to facing this season?
I think the Patriots will give us a run for our money this year.  Brady is on his game but we gotta watch out for those deflated balls!
That's a great point!  How did you feel about the whole "deflate gate" thing?
I think it is unfair and there's never a need to cheat.  Football is a game that is to be played with honor.

I just saw highlights of Superbowl VIII.
I'm not a sports history nut.
Miami over Minnesota, second team to win consecutive Superbowls.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Bob Griese for Miami, Fran Tarkenton for the Vikings.
Where did they play?
Rice Stadium, Houston.
Who scored first?
Miami scored two touchdowns in the first quarter, no score for Minnesota.
What was the score at halftime?
17-0.
Who was in the halftime show?
The Texas Longhorns band and Miss Texas.
Not much there.
Miami scored once more in the third to make it 24-0.
When did the Vikings score?
Fourth quarter, four yard run.
Who made the touchdown?
Fran Tarkenton on a scramble.
Too bad - I liked the Vikings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any clue if the Washington Redskins are a good team?
Not really, why?
My sons friend was bragging about their stats.
We could always look them up.
Yes, I thought you might know.
I do follow a lot of the NFL stats but only teams I like.
I know that Kirk Cousins is on the team.
What position is he?
He is a quarterback.
He might be the one who broke records in 2016.
Not sure if anyone else good is on the team.
I just can't believe they people wanted them to change their name.
I know.
People get so offended by some dumb things.
I'm glad they didn't. I'd consider it an honor to have a team want to refernce a heritage.
Me too.
I do know that Don Shula used to play for them in the fifties.
Really, The Dolphins old coach?
Yes.
Well that's pretty cool to know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
so who is your favorite QB?
well i tend to go fore the more Payton Manning types.
does that include Eli Manning?
of course it does! that is one talented family.
i was super excited the day that both of them had played in the super bowl.
i know. it is like they were made to play those huge games to win.
maybe they will play against eachother.
if only that will happen.
i wonder who will be in the next superbowl
maybe the new York jets
or possibly the Texans.
you think they will make it?
there is always a time for anything.
sure, if they fix their coaching situation.
now that is a whole other story. who knows how that will go.
it just seems like they keep firing coaches over there.
that and the players keep leaving.
if JJ watt leaves that is it.
if he leaves they have zero strong defense.
let us hope they keep him then.[
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot wait for the Atlanta Falcons new season.
Will they still be good?
They will be. Ryan's still a great quarterback, Quinn's a great coach.
How demoralizing was that Super Bowl loss?
It was tough to swallow but it will be better soon.
It's not better now?
No but time will heal it.
As a Seahawks fan I know the pain of a loss to the Patriots.
Why didn't they run the ball with Lynch?
I don't know, they didn't. I wish they would have.
That's a true shame.
I know, right? It is really a shame. It was right there.
What happens if they run the ball?
They probably win the game.
I wish I could take that moment back.
Me too. I want it back.
Everything gets better with time though, right?
Everything in NFL football at least.
The Falcons will do well.
So will the Seahawks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The season is nearly about to come. I really can't wait any longer
When's the first game? First Thurs in Sept?
I think so. I forget who is playing. I know the Superbowl winner always plays opening day.
Yeah I'm not too sure about who they are playing.
Does it matter anyway? They crush everyone and everything regardless.
Let's forget about pointing out the obvious. How do you feel about the other 31 teams
Compared to the Patriots? Not too good.
Well make believe the Pats don't exist. Who would you see contending
I'm going all in and think the Chiefs may have a chance this season
You're crazy. You really think so?
I think Alex Smith is going to play out of his mind now that he is aware his end is near with them
The only way the Chiefs will progress is if they start stretching the field more.
Yeah definitely. No more of these seasons where no receivers catch a single touchdown.
That is still unreal. It feels like you almost have to try and achieve something that difficult.
Yeah. especially when your running game was going so well with Charles and West and whatnot.
You would think that would open a ton of single coverage for receivers to take advantage of
I think all they really had was Dwayne Bowe.
If he could just be consistent in catching the ball he would be such a great player. He can block and everything else.
Everything, but the most important part of his position.
Yeah, but we will see if the Chiefs finally step up to the plate this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey guy! Only 30+ days til preseason!
I know I can't wait man! Pittsburgh is going to win it all this year.
Say what!?! I don't even know that they are going to win their division!
Come on! You can't be serious, If you don't think we are going to win the division, who is going to?
It could be Cincy or Baltimore.
Well we agree that it won't be Cleveland!
For sure. They've got Brock Osweiler as QB. He'll do the same for them as he did for Houston, absolutely nothing!
They are hopeless! Worst team in the league.
Baltimore is always a wild card for me. They were only one game from the division title last year, and the core is returning, so They are contenders.
Yeah, I'll give you that, but Cincy is finished if you ask me.
Why do you say that, Dalton got hurt last year right? Or was that the year before last?
It doesn't even ,matter. They have no leadership.
Well. I guess I can see your point. They have no respect for their coach.
I used to really like Marvin Lewis, but he just can't get it done.
You're right. This has to be his last year .
But , you never know. If Dalton can stay healthy, they can go 11-5 and take Pitts. place as top dog.
I don't think so! But whatever man!
But I will confess that if , and thats a big if, all your Steelers can stay healthy an not suspended, they should stay on top.
Low blow man! Anyway, what's your final call?
I see Pitts at 12-4 , Baltimore 10-6, Cincinnati 8-8 and Cleveland 1-15.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you still a fan of the Bungles?
Who?
Excuse me, I mean the Cincinnati Bengals?
I still watch their games from time to time.
They haven't been good in years. I've pretty much given up on them.
I'm definitely not the fan I used to be. Who do you like now?
I support the Patriots mostly.
I see, so you're a fairweather fan.
What?
You just like whoever is winning.
Hey, I supported the Bengals for decades. When was the last time they won a championship?
1988.
See what I mean?
I guess so. Loyalty can only go so far.
Exactly.
I didn't realize it had been so long.
You should do your research before you accuse someone of being a fairweather fan.
At least there's hope. They didn't do too badly last year, and the year before that they made it to the Wildcard Playoffs.
If they can make it to post season consistently, I might be willing to give them another shot.
Fair enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope one day that women will have the chance to play on the NFL.
Women are already allowed to play in the NFL.
Really?
Really. The NFL welcomes all human beings.
Then why hasn't there been a female player, yet?
Probably because there hasn't been one good enough, yet, but that could be changing soon.
What do you mean?
Have you heard of Becca Longo?
No. Who is she?
She is the first female to win a scholarship to a Division I or Division II school.
What school is she going to?
Adams State University in Colorado.
What position does she play?
She's a kicker.
This is on a traditional men's football team?
Yes it is.
How old is she?
She's 18 years old.
She must be really good.
I've read that she is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long can the Patriots keep their dynasty going?
I think they can keep going for a bit yet, they have the best QB possibly ever, and a great back up QB.  They have the best coach and many of the same players
what do you think about teams drafting a QB as one of the top picks in the first round in the NFL draft?
I think they're fools.   Most of those picks wind up as duds, and meanwhile theyre passing up highly talented position playerswqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq
DO you buy into the safety debate, about concussions?
I think that stuff is real, but players for the most part know what they are getting themselves into.
The NFL is more interactive than ever before, thats one reason why I love it
What do you mean?
OK you have fantasy football, then you can interact with all the players on apps like twitter and see the games from periscope. So many more examples too
Thats a good point I never really thought about that, much different from just watching on your couch in the 1980's.
So what do you think is the future of the NFL?
I think it keep growing big time.  I am excited to see how the expansion team into Vegas works out.
I would love to go see a game when I am out in Vegas, that is very cool that a team is moving into that market
Vegas has been a big player in the NFLs popularity also with people being able to bet on the games, especially the superbowl
College ball has also become super popular I think because of the NFL
Yes students want to follow teams to see if any of those players could make it into the NFL and become stars and be able to say, yeah I used to watch him play at my school
Actually several businesses have flourished on the back of the NFL, like Sunday sports bars such as BW3's everyone wants to watch the games in public with their friends
Nothing goes better with NFL games than wings and beer.
How many games do you think you will go to this year?
well with the cost being so high i'd say I will feel pretty lucky if I can get up to one game
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many movies can you remember were about NFL Football?
Oh geez, the first thing comes to mind is Any Given Sunday.
Very good movie.
I remember a movie with Nick Nolte called North Dallas Forty
Right on.
Your turn.
Turn? Are we playing a game?
Sure, why not, lets make it a game.
Ok, hm.... The Replacements.
I got one, Draft Day.
Good Flick. OH, i got one.... Wildcats.
Here's an oldie... Semi Tough.
Remember The Last Boy Scout?
With Bruce Willis, yes!
Wasn't there one about some terrorist group gonna use the blimp to attack the Super Bowl?
Yes, Black Sunday.
Wow, you remember that flick.
Yes, i remember it from like the 70's.
Some good Football movies.
Yes, yes they are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am simply dying to see these receivers get on the field for some football.
Honestly we are being spoiled rotten by the talent of receivers.
I would say we are in the midst of some of the best receiver play in recent history.
Definitely. You have Green, Beckham, Jones, Hopkins and so much more.
Who do you think is the best receiver in the league?
I definitely think it's a close call between Green and Julio. I would give the edge to Julio.
Does Julio get that edge over Green because of their playoff run?
To be honest yeah. Julio was completely unstoppable the entire playoffs.
That one catch in the Superbowl was freakish.
A man of his size shouldn't be able to do half the things that he does.
At his current pace he will be a Hall of Famer in no time.
He deserves it. He's a good guy and an even better player.
So you don't think DeAndre Hopkins is worthy of being number one?
I think it's just because they had Osweiler, so I can't give it to him despite it being out of his control.
I'm just playing devil's advocate. I believe Julio is the number one guy.
Yeah, I know. Also he's not that good with yards after the catch.
I believe after his huge season 2 or 3 years ago he said he needed to work on that.
He showed this season that he still needs to work on it.
He is too big to be so easy to take down. He could easily be the best if he fixes that.
That and gets an actual quarterback who gives him the ball endlessly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well, Peyton Manning's retired. And his team's doing okay.
Okay, what else is new?
Uhhh, not much.
What about the sports commentators?
Uhhh, nothing special about them.
Well, how else are we supposed to do things around here?
Uhhh, just by talking?
Sure, but what about the injured players and the other things?
Who cares about them? They'll come back!
Wow, you must not like football.
Well, it's not interesting to me.
Uhhh, then why are you talking about some cool football players?
Cause, it's just part of mingling.
Oh, okay.
See, if you know how to talk to people, and know what to talk about, you'll get along.
Hey, there's Magic Johnson, right now!
Who's he?
A cool basketball player.
Meh, I think he's okay.
Dude, he's like one of the basketball legends!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm surprised about how many football players go broke or declare bankruptcy when their careers are over.
Sometimes it;s due to bad investments.
Dan Marino is a good example of that.
Isn't he a former quarterback for the Miami Dolphins?
Yes. He played 17 seasons for them.
How did he go broke?
He had invested a lot of money in a company that filed bankruptcy.
So he lost all of his investment.
Exactly and similar situations have happened to other players.
I know of another reason.
What's that?
Having too many kids.
What are you talking about?
Travis Henry was a running back who played for the Bills, Titans and Broncos.
The name isn't ringing a bell, but tell me what happened.
He fathered at least 11 children by 10 different women and owed child support for 9 of the kids.
So he wasn't paying his child support?
No and he owes 170,000 dollars a year for it.
Most people don't even make that much a year.
Now you know why he's broke.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How is this season gonna play out?
I dunno, it's tough being a Saints fan.
I don't seem them doing much this year.
Drew is still pretty good.
I think his best days are being him.
Yes, and the rest of the team sucks too.
You think Drew is better than Archie Manning?
Yes, Archie was gritty but never won.
He didn't have much of a supporting cast though.
You think Drew does?
Well, you have a point.
Guess we will be the Ain'ts again this year.
Don't give up hope, strange things happen.
Yea, it's a funny shaped ball.
Morten Andersen was automatic back in the day.
Yes he was.
Think we will win the division?
Well, it's a weak division, so there's a chance.
I don't see it happening.
Me neither really.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best quarterback ever?
It has to be Tom Brady, he has the most rings too.
Yea but he cheated.
He won another superbowl after inflategate, though.
That's true. Alright who is the number 2 quaterback?
I don't know, maybe Joe Montana?
I think Joe Montana was great under pressure and at orchestrating comebacks.
He had Jerry Rice to throw too, maybe too easy.
Okay, who is the number three quaterback?
I have to think about this, what do you think?
Probably Troy Aikman.
I hate the Cowboys. Can't agree.
Who do you think, then?
Has to be some older generation guy probably.
Maybe John Elway?
Yea he was always pretty awesome. And he got better as he got older which is amazing.
Peyton Manning is another really good choice.
He was really solid and dependable.
Overall I think Brady would beat all of them.
I think you're right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the preseason?
I already bought more sports channels.
Which ones do you have?
I got all the ESPNs & TNT sports. They included free streaming.
I only stream right now. I was going to wait until the season to get the bigger channels.
So, you missed the Manning interview by Smith.
Did Steven A interviewed Manning?
Yeah, they had a sit down for about an hour.
Did he talk about his injuries at all?
He only mentioned his workout routine.
So, Smith didn't press him.
No, he didn't. He seemed to go easy on Peyton for some reason.
That's probably because he's a fan favorite.
Oh, it was favoritism for sure.
When Matt inteviewed Manning, he didn't hold back.
Yeah, Matt was the one who got Manning to admit to his injuries.
He sure did. Matt let it be known that Peyton was still in recovery.
I want him back next season, but it's pointless if he's still injuried.
There is absolultely no need to lie about his injuries. There is no way his team would trade him even injuried.
I agree, but I think it's a natural fear injured players have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL season starts exactly two months from today!  Are you excited as I am?
I'm getting there!  Which rookie quarterback do you think will have the biggest impact?
I think Deshaun Watson will have a nice rookie season for the Houston Texans!  What about you?
I agree about Watson, but I think Mitchell Trubisky will do well with the Bears if he gets the opportunity.
I don't think Trubisky will do well.  He doesn't have anyone to throw to now that Alshon Jeffrey signed with the Eagles.
That's true.  I don't think he will probably get a lot of playing time with Mike Glennon beginning the year as the starting quarterback.
Exactly.  Who do you think will win rookie of the year?
Leonard Fournette for sure if he can stay healthy.  He will get a lot of touches for the Jaguars and will bust some big plays.
All this talk about the NFL is getting me excited!  Who do you think will win it all?
I think most people would say the New England Patriots will repeat with all their talent and their addition of Brandin Cooks, and I agree with those people.
I think they will be tough to beat, but I think the Atlanta Falcons are going to win it.  I think they are going to be hungry to redeem themselves.  Have you seen the new commercial with Matt Ryan?
Yeah I think they will be right there again at the end.  It should be an exciting season!  What other team are you expecting big things from?
I think the Denver Broncos will have a bounce back season.  I like Trevor Siemian in year two and like a lot of their offseason moves.
I agree!  I love their acquisition of Jamaal Charles.  I think he feels like he has a lot left in the tank and wants to prove all the doubters wrong.
Who is your pick for Most Valuable Player of the upcoming season?
I like Tom Brady again, especially with having Brandin Cooks to throw to.  They are going to make an amazing combination.
I see 20 touchdowns between the two.  I see a second coming of the Tom Brady to Randy Moss connection of old.
That would be great even though I'm not a New England Patriots fan.  I'll be rooting for the Miami Dolphins like usual.
They had a good ending to last season, hopefully they will pick up where they left off.  I think Tannehill will have a nice season.
I sure hope so for my happiness sakes!  I'm getting tired of the Patriots dominating the division.  I can't wait two months for the season to start!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL teams got the best results from this past draft in April 2017?
You really do not know for a number of years how any draft pick or class is going to perform.  Some do well and others due to injuries or performance do not.
Which teams seem to have made some good choices then in terms of positions ?
Each team drafted player which the team believed would fill a necessary gap in offense or defense
Can you give me some examples of how some of the teams did?
Sure, lets take the teams from New York since I am a New Yorker
Ok, how did the Jets do in the draft?
Interesting the Jets have decided to stay with their quarterbacks and not try for any new ones to develop.
Who are the Jets quarterbacks?
Christian Hackenberg is one and  Bryce Petty is another.
Who did they draft first?
They used a number 6 draft and picked up a player named  Jamal Adams
What school did he play for ?
He played for LSU which is Louisiana State
I thought he would be higher in the draft
I am sure that was the consensus.  But he went in the sixth round which was a bargain for the JETS
What position does he play ?
He is a safety
What is a safety?
A saftey is a defensive back that lines up about 10 to 15 yards in front of the line of scrimmage and then waits to see how the play unfolds to follow the ball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you looked at any of the NFL schedulet yet?
No I have not. Any good matchups?
I saw the Cowboys and Raiders play one week.  Don't you like the Cowboys?
Wow, what a good matchup base on last year.
I agree, they are two up and coming teams.
Dallas lost a lot on defense, but their offense is good.
Do you think that the Raiders will move to Las Vegas?
I think there are some road blocks with the owners on the move.
Like what issues?
I think a lot has to do with the TV market in the bay area.  It's a lot larger than Las Vegas.
Well the NFL does make tons of money from ads.
They do and all of the owners know it.
That is probably why they let the Rams and Chargers move to Los Angeles.
Without a doubt.  St. Louis was a small market for an NFL team.
I really liked the Rams when Kurt Warner was there.
The greatest show on turf!
They had a nice little run with him.
Yes they did.  Won two Super Bowls I think.
Now they have an empty stadium in St. Louis.
Hopefully they can use it for college or high school events.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest running back in NFL history?
Since I've been watching, probably either Barry Sanders or Emmitt Smith.
They were both pretty great, had a different style.
I always thought Emmitt Smith would run through tackles, but Barry Sanders was very elusive, and could run around defenders.
Marshawn Lynch was a lot like both of them, but he seemed to have a ton of power.
Did you hear that Marshawn Lynch came out of retirement?
Yeah, I heard that he's going to play for Oakland.
If he still at the top of his game, the Raiders could win a lot of games next season.
Yeah, with Derek Carr and Amari Cooper they could score a lot of points.
I think Amari Cooper is going to go down as one of the greatest receivers ever.
Maybe, if he can keep playing with good quarterbacks. I think it helped Jerry Rice that he played with Joe Montana and Steve Young.
Do you think Jerry Rice was the best receiver ever?
Yeah, the only one that comes close in my mind was Calvin Johnson.
I think Randy Moss and Terrell Owens were two of the best ever.
I think they could've been, they just didn't seem to have the same work ethic as someone like Jerry Rice.
Work ethic is always pretty important, that's why I like Larry Fitzgerald.
Larry Fitzgerald is one of my favorites as well. He's a great player, and seems to be a good guy all around.
I imagine Larry Fitzgerald is going to retire soon. Hopefully he and Carson Palmer can have one more good season.
Carson Palmer has been playing NFL football for 15 seasons, he's running out of time.
He could have a few more good seasons if he can stay healthy. Just look at Tom Brady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the NFL?
I think it's a great sport with some issues.
What kind of issues?
Mostly just with the referees and business model of it.
Can you explain a bit more?
Well I think the referees are a lot more biased these days than they used to be.
I imagine it would be difficult to be a referee.
I agree but the issue is still their.
Do you think it makes that much of a deal?
I think it does.
Why?
Mostly because it's always in your mind while you watch the games and wonder if a referee did something to make a team win.
That's a good point.
Plus there are always questionable calls everygame.
How many referees do you think are biased?
I would guess at least 50% or more.
Do you really think it's that many?
I do, referees are sports fans too they love the game.
Why else would they be a referee.
That's a good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like to win the Super Bowl this year?
Every discussion starts and ends with the Patriots.
I agree, but they aren't necessarily gonna win again.
Yes, but they are favorites for a reason. Tom Brady is just the ultimate winner.
I think the Cowboys have a shot to come out of the NFC.
I see some regression with Dak Prescott and they are in a pretty tough division.
I think Houston is also in a good spot.
They definitely are well coached and have a great defense.
What do you think about Green Bay this year.
I like Aaron Rodgers obviously. It just seems that they can never stop anyone in a big spot.
For some reason I also think Pittsburgh can make one last run with Ben.
They definitely have a bunch of playmakers.
If their defense can hold they can put up a lot of points.
Big Ben, Brown, and Bell are a a really solid top 3 offense.
Who do you think will be the worst team in the league this year?
It has to be the Jets.
The Jets? Why do you think they are going to be bad.
It seems to me they are tanking on purpose. They've added no one and don't have a quarterback.
I can't wait to start researching my fantasy team and the start of the season.
I agree. Hope it's another exciting year and my hometown Lions can stay competitive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does NFL stand for?
National Football league
Where are the Packers from?
Green Bay
Where is that?
In Wisconsin
Are they good?
Yes and they go to the playoffs a lot.
That is awesome. I want to watch them
They are exciting to watch
What are their colors?
Yellow and green
Who is their best player?
Aaron Rodgers
Is he their quarterback?
Yes
Cool. Who is another good team?
The 49ers
Where are they from?
San Francisco
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who do you think will meet in the Super Bowl this year?
I think this is the Raider's year to finally breakthrough.
I just don't see how to Patriots lose in the playoffs as long as Brady is their quarterback.
I agree he is a special player, but the Raiders are just too young and talented. This is their year to breakthrough.
In terms of the NFC, I think the Cowboys are a team that can make a deep playoff run.
I like watching the Cowboys play, but they are just a little young for me to get behind.
I agree, their prime may be a few years out.
I think the Packers will end up winning the NFC.
That is not a bad choice.
Aaron Rodgers is my primary motivation for that pick.
So then, who wins a Packers/Raiders Super Bowl?
If I had to put money on it, I would say the Packers.
I agree with you. Aaron Rodgers is too talented to lose on that stage.
He also has experience that a lot of Raiders don't have.
Yeah, you're right. That is crucial in games like the Super Bowl.
Now that the Super Bowl is settled, what teams do you think will take a big step forward?
I think the Panthers will rebound from last year and have a great year.
They definitely have all the tools and pieces needed to rebound.
I am looking forward to this year to see who all can challenge the Raiders and the Packers.
So am I. This should be an exciting year to be an NFL fan.

Cheddar or Beer?
Huh?
For brauts this Sunday?
It doesn't matter.  Sorry, I'm a bit down I didn't get the tickets to Evesco this Sunday.
I know, which is why I bought us two box seats this Sunday!
What?? Are you Serious??
I am.  But I must warn you it's all an evil ploy for you to join me tailgating finally.
You have my attention sir!
So beer brauts or cheader worsts?
BEER!
Yes! This is going to amazing.  Manning will be there signing autographs.
No way, I heard Rice is going to be singing the national athem too.
Manning is going to be there!  Can Rice throw a 111 yard touchdown?
No, but he can catch it!
Ha ha!  Good point.
So what time is kick off?
1.
Anything I can bring to this tailgating thing?
I got this covered, just bring a broncos' hoodie!
Awesome, I love you man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know anything about the history of the NFL. What can you tell me.
The NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association.
How many teams did they have at the time?
There were 14 teams in the league for the 1920 season. Only two remain in the league today!
Which teams?
The Chicago Cardinals (now Arizona Cardinals) and Decatur Staleys (Chicago Bears).
Did they have a championship game?
Championship in 1920 was awarded to the Akron Pros, the only undefeated team that season.
So there was no Super Bowl?
No Super Bowl until 1967. Akron was awarded the championship based on their record.
Teams now play 16 games in a 17 week season. How many did they play in 1920.
It varied, actually, Scheduling was left up to the individual teams. There were no official standings.
Wow, that is crazy!
It was! The teams varied in how many games each played, and some even played non-league opponents.
So if they were the American Professional Football Association, when did they become the NFL?
They changed their name to the National Football League in the summer of 1922.
Any other notable firsts?
They began an annual draft of players from the college level in 1936.
Oh, that is neat. The draft is a big deal these days.
And the first televised game was held on October 22, 1939.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited abou the upcoming NFL season.
I am too, it should be starting soon.
Yes, pre-season games will start next month!
Who is your favorite team?
My favorite NFL team is the Saints.
What city is the Saints in?
The Saints are in New Orleans.
How did they do last year.
The saints had a good season, but not like the one in 2009.
What was special about that season?
The City of New Orleans was still recovering from the massive huricane that hit in 2005.
What did the Saints do that year?
The Saints had a winning season and ended up going to the super bowl to play the great Peyton Manning.
Who won the super bowl in 2010.
In 2010, the Saints defeated Peyton Manning and the Colts easily to win their first ever super bowl title!
I bet the city was happy about that.
Yes, there were celebrations everywhere and Drew Brees became a household name.
Is Brees still the quarterback for the saints?
Drew Brees is currently their quaterback and has passed for more 5000 yard season than any other quaterback has in the NFL.
Wow, I can't wait to see what Brees and the saints can do this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are you going to be rooting for this NFL season?
You know I love my Cowboy.
But they have had a lot of problems lately.
I know. I wish they didn't have so many off the field problems.
Jerry Jones really needs to do something to keep his players out of trouble.
True, but if they had a coach that demanded respect like Jimmy Johnson or Tom Landry it would make a difference.
At least they seem to have their quarterback situation worked out.
Yes. I really like Prescott. He had a great season last year.
I know. I can't wait to see him now that he has some experience.
I agree. I predict this will be a break out season for him.
I am going to miss Romo, but it was time for him to retire.
He had too many injuries to be successful.
I agree. He was never going to get Dallas to a Super Bowl.
That's true. They probably should have let him go before now.
I know. Dallas is always a contender at the beginning of the season, but never seem to manage the hype.
Hopefully this year they will be more motivated.
So are you saying you think they are heading back to the Super Bowl?
I wouldn't go that far. They still need to stay injury free and keep their players out of trouble.
Anything is possible.
Yes. It would be good to see them holding up the Lombardi trophy at the end of the season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the Lions lately?
I have.  They honestly aren't that good.  I miss the days when Barry Sanders played.
He was a football legend!  What players do you like?
I don't really like any of the Lions players, though Johnson did okay.
He's pretty good.  I like some of the guys on the other teams.  Tom Brady is pretty amazing.
He is excellent. Didn't he play for University of Michigan before he went pro?
Yes he did.  How do you feel about the Manning brothers?
I think Eli is obviously better.
What team is your favorite?
I love the cowboys!  You?
I have to support the Lions because I'm from Michigan, but I also love the Patriots....Brady is the man!
Who would you like to see in the superbowl?  Like what would be your dream match?
Hmmm..I'd love to see the Lions finally make the superbowl for once!  I don't care who they play!
Lions have never played in a superbowl.
I know!  I wish they could just get it together and play well enough to have the chance at a superbowl title.
I doubt that will ever happen.  Lions are too inconsistent!
Who would you want to see?
I have to have my cowboys.  I'd like to see them beat the Lions!  It would be  a sure bet that the Cowboys would beat Detroit Lions!
If you say so!  Lions sometimes surprise me and they have beat the Cowboys in the past!
True.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm ready for Manning to come back.
Yea, it was a long season for the Broncos without him.
How about we get Elway back.
He's getting a little old don't you think?
Is Elvis Grbac available?
That's funny, maybe we can pick up Neil O'Donnell in free agency!
I'd wanna get Bill Romanowski.
He is an animal.
I think he is scary.
He could sure play defense!
i like him in "The Longest Yard."
I miss the old orange crush uniforms.
Yes, I never was a fan of these new ones.
They started winning with those though.
Yea, I doubt they'll go back.
They whip out old ones once in awhile.
Do you know who they open against?
I don't know yet.
We need to get a schedule.
I'm going to opening day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's go see that game next weekend.
You mean the Patirots game?
Well, of course.
Okay. Where are watching?
I can get us tickets to go.
Oh, that would be awesome.
Yeah, my friend has a connection.
Okay. I am in.
I will let you know that ticket price later today.
Awesome. I will drive us.
Perfect.
Is it just us two?
No, my friend with the hook up and another buddy is coming.
That works for me. I have the SUV, so we will have plenty of room.
That works well. Do you want to tailgate before?
Yes, NFL football tailgating is the best.
I agree. I will get the others to chip in and help out with food and stuff.;
That works. I have a grill we can take.
Yes, that is the coolest plan ever.
I am so ready.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best team in the Midwest.
Wow! there are some awful teams but I'll go with the Colts I guess.
Yeah, Bengals and Browns are awful.
How about the Bears?
I don't see the Bears doing better this year.
Sad to see how much they've struggled.
How about the best team out West?
Seattle or maybe the Raiders.
Don't forget Arizona, they've improved.
Have they?
Best team in Texas?
Easy, the Cowboys and maybe the best team overall.
How about the South?
Probably still the Falcons.
I would love to see the Titans pull it all together.
Isn't that where Mariota is at?
Northeast?
Still has to be New England.
Yeah, sad to see how bad the Jets are.
They're awful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When do you think the NFL allows legal gambling?
Is it really up to them?
Yeah I think so, they have a team moving to Vegas.
Yeah it will get dicey there so maybe in the next 2 years.
I mean more than one city needs to allow it.
Well its more of a state thing then the NFL allowing it.
But the NFL could form a partnership with one of the daily fantasy companies
Thats not a market they want to go in
They have to think of new ways to make the game interesting
Well that doesnt really affect the game all that much
Yeah but it invites fans into watching the games
They get the stuff they need on their cell phones
They need to concentrate on Social media more.
Yeah banning teams from posting videos is dumb
Thats where they ruin the game for people
They are bringing back celebrations in a way
They need to sort of organically create personality
I agree with you on that point
Though I do not know that the game will ever really suffer
You never know they could get to NHL depths
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do football players do after they finish their career?
Some go into business.
I've seen others announcing.
They have to have something planned, because average careers aren't often long.
Yeah, even someone with a great career in football is done by age 40 at the latest.
A kicker might stay longer, but most are finished by 40.
Wow, you really have to plan for the rest of your life.
Well, they have some money if they make it that far.
Some do, some spend it.
You have to plan no matter what career you choose.
You never know in life where it will take you.
That's for sure.
I've heard of some players opening restaurants.
Wow, that's quite a change.
Some go into coaching or general management.
I bet they make excellent coaches.
I'm sure with all that experience and talent they can mentor a lot of people.
That's true.
Sometimes players form a foundation or charity for a special cause.
I think that is incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the football season to start?
Yes! I can't wait. Who do you think is going to win the NFC East?
I think the Cowboys will win it again. They have a great quarterback and runningback.
I don't know, I think the Redskins have a really good shot this year.
The Redskins have a tough schedule though. It will either be Dallas or NY Giants.
I don't think the Giants will be good this year. Eli Manning is getting old and they don't have a good run game.
On second thought, I wouldn't count the Eagles out either. Carson Wentz was pretty good last year.
True he was but they need help in other areas and aren't ready to compete in my opinion.
What do you think about the NFC North?
It's hard to imagine anyone but Packers winning it.
Lions were good last year and they've gotten stronger in the off season.
I think Matt Stafford is still overrated and has yet to show he can win big games.
I think Rodgers is getting older. Maybe Minnesota can step up this year.
But they lost Peterson which is going to make it tough for them.
One this for sure is that the Bears are going to be terrible again.
They just can't seem to find a decent quarterback. At least their running game is good.
Who do you think wins NFC South?
The Falcons again, no doubt.
And NFC West?
I'm going out on a limb and saying Rams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just heard startling news about the NFL.
What was it?
80% of players go broke after the first 5 years.
I've heard something similar.
They're thinking of starting financial programs for the players.
That'd be a great idea.
I think it's needed.
Especially for new players and draft picks.
Right.
They should've rolled this out years ago.
I agree.
If I was in the NFL, I'd welcome the classes.
It definitely couldn't hurt.
I wonder if it's helpful yet.
They're implementing it now.
I'm anxious to see the new statistics.
I'm sure it will help most players.
As long as they don't splurge too much.
It'd be cool to have ex players teach the class.
That's a great idea!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm a huge New England Patriots fan.
Congratulations on the Super Bowl victory.
Thank you! What team do you like?
I like the Jags.
The Jacksonville Jaguars?
Yes, the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Do they still have Gabbart as their quarterback?
Yes, l think so.
What happened to Maurice Jones-Drew?
He went away in free agency.
Do they ever play the Buccaneers? Two teams playing from the same state!
They must have at one point.
Wasn't the coach of the Jags with Seattle at one point?
Gus Bradley? Yes, he was.
Is he still there?
No, he was fired. They gave him a few seasons but he couldn't make a winning record.
I'm sorry to hear that.
That's OK, he was a bad coach.
I hope they do well this year.
Thank you. I hope the Patriots do well as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the Oakland Raiders.
They are really good.
They began in 1960.
They are a AFC West team.
Their uniform is Black and Silver.
Sometimes it is white and silver.
Mark Davis is the owner.
He is the majority owner.
Their president is Marc Badain.
General manager is Reggie McKenzie.
Jack Del Rio is the head coach.
They have changed their names.
First they were the Oakland Raiders.
Then LA Raiders.
Back in Oakland now.
They are moving to Vegas.
I do not know if they know when.
I call them Raider Nation.
I call them MIB.
Yes, Men in Black.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Damn, man.
What's up?
Uhhhh, my car broke down.
How so?
My engine got torn apart, and now I can't drive the rest of the way to Georgia to see the Falcons take on the Saints!
Hey, I'm also headed in the same direction, wanna call a tow truck to tow your vehicle, and then we head to Atlanta?
Uhhhh, sure, yeah!
Okay, I'll call the tow truck now, then!
Well, I guess you're a lifesaver today, then!
Hey, I'm here to call about a broken down car in the middle of Interstate 237, towards Georgia. Yeah, can ya pick it up? Thanks. Okay. Bye. Alright, we good to go to Georgia?
Yeah, l guess.
Don't worry, brotha. We're gonna see those Falcons destroy the Saints. You can hang out at my crib while your car's getting repaired.
I guess I owe you one, eh?
Nahhh, it's fine.
Dude, if it weren't for you, I would have just given up on going to the Falcons game.
Dude, I think it's better to watch it on tv, honestly.
Well, I like the experience of being out there in the stadium. You know, it's sort of like a bonding thing.
Hmmm... I can deal with that.
Really?
Yeah, I also do it. Just not as often as you do, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you kept up with the NFL during the off season?
Not much. What about you?
No. I don't even know how the draft went.
Me either but I hope the Falcons have a good season.
Me too. That Matt Ryan is really something.
If he has another season like last season they'll be good again.
I hope he does but they need some defense.
You got that right. But it was better than season before last.
You know what they say, offense brings in the fans...
But defense wins championships.
That was sure true this year.
Uh huh. I still can't believe how the defense blew that lead in the Super Bowl.
One of the worst collapses in the history of sports.
It's hard to bet against Tom Brady.
How much longer can that guy go on?
He's got to call it quits someday. But maybe it will be a Falcons-Patriots rematch.
I wouldn't mind seeing that at all. Especially if the Falcons could win.
They deserve one, you know, after all this time.
Never had one yet.
Well maybe the 2018 Super Bowl will be theirs. Finally!
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL is about to start.  Are you excited?
Oh yeah, pre-season starts in about a month.
Pre-season? Nah I don't watch those games.
Why not?  You usually get to see the newly drafted rookies play.
Yeah, but it's just not very exciting with nothing at stake.
True.  I agree pre-season is a bit too long too.
Maybe 2 games per team max.  They are just trying to milk airtime for advertising money.
What you can do.  it's big business.  I can't wait to see Brees back in action though.
They drafted some defense to help protect Brees
I sure hope so.  They can't keep trying to outscore opponents.
Yeah remember that game between the Saints and the Giants?
That was nuts.  Scored like 50+ points each.
How ironic the game ends on a field goal though haha.
Yeah very funny.  Defense hasn't improved much since that game.
Still giving up way too many points and Brees probably only have 1 or 2 good years left.
This is his last stand.  They are not like the Patriots who are stacked on D.
Yeah that gives Brady a few extra years before he retires.
Yup, just comes out throws accurately and scores fast so he can rest.
Brady gets sacked way less than Brees cause of it.
Either way, should be a good year for the Saints.  Hope that D fulfills their promise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So will you be watching any NFL games this year?
I don't know.  I used to love the Patriots...
You don't anymore?
Not really.  That's why I don't think I'll follow the season.
What happened?
The whole "deflategate" thing turned me off.
Why so?  I don't think it was that big of a deal.
Well, I lost faith in Tom Brady and he was my favorite player.
I really don't think he did anything wrong.
Do you think he should have turned over his cell phone?
Not personally, no.  Do you?
I don't know.  It really bothered me at the time.
I don't think they cheated.  Even if they did, it wasn't that bad.
I'm just not sure I agree.
What was so horrible about it?
Just the fact that they might have cheated.  It made me feel like a fool for following them for so long.
You felt duped?
Yes, definitely.  I just don't think I'll ever have that passion for them again.
Well, I see your point of view but perhaps you can get past it?
I doubt it but I appreciate your optimism!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you plan on watching the upcoming NFL season?
Definitely. I am really sad that the Oakland Raiders are moving.
The San Francisco 49ers moved to Santa Clara. The Bay Area is losing its second team.
So true. What a shame it is! I think the Broncos and Patriots will make it to next year's super bowl.
Hmm. I could definitely see that. The 2016 super bowl with the Broncos and Panthers was a very good watch. I thought the Panthers would win.
I was shocked, as well. I love watching football though it's such a good sport. Very technical!
Definitely, I have to agree with you. I hate when refs favor a team though. They need more honest referees.
Who is your all time favorite NFL player?
Definitely Joe Montana. He was the best football player of all team, even though Tom Brady beat some of his records.
Really? I didn't know that. So Tom Brady is the best player in the NFL right now?
I would say so! Based on his age and stats he still has a few good years before retirement and has many super bowl rings already.
Did you know that Tom Brady is married to Gisele Bundchen?
The model? No I didnt! What a small world. Do you have a favorite football player?
I do, Marshawn Lynch.
Why is he your favorite player?
Because he is fast, funny and righteous. He is a good loser and an even better winner because he is a good person.
Where do you usually buy your football tickets?
From tickethub.com you can pay using PayPal it's really easy.
Can you send me the football 2017 page link?
Sure go to nfl.com
XXXXXXXXXXX
Looks like the Raiders are Winning!
They are?
Yes, 20-3.
That's a good game.
Game is almost over.
Last 5 minutes huh?
Yes!!
The heat is rising.
All thier best players are in the game.
That's the secret.
They were strong from the first quarter!
They always are.
Except when they're playing the Seahawks.
This is true.
That is thier rival.
Definitely.
We're talking a 20-year long standing battle.
That is awesome.
Been following them since the 90's.
Me too Brad!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Chargers?
They are from San Diego right?
Right
They are decent
Do you think they can win it this year?
Anyone has a shot
True
They have a good offense, but I question their defense
I feel the opposite
I think they have a shot based on how good they are
They have a strong quarterback.
He is good
I am not sure they can beat the top teams though
They were last place in their division last year
I know, but they are better than that
Hopefully they can top the division this year
Do you think they can beat the Chiefs?
Yes I do
What about the Raiders?
The Raiders are not gonna be as good this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wait, are you saying.....
Yeah, we actually get to watch him practice with the Packers!
Wooooooo, baby!
Alright then, let's go!
Hells yeah!
(The two black brothers arrive at Packers Stadium) Hey, look at the Packers!
Woot, woot! Go, Packers! Work it out, let's go!
WOOOOOOOOOOO
Hey, be quiet over there in the stands! They're focusing here!
Sorry! My bad!
it's alright! We love fans, though!
Point taken!
Okay, now what?
Now we just watch!
Okay.......
.........
Look at that throw!
Wow, so far!
Man, look at that!
Yeah, man!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think will be the surprise team this NFL season?
I'm thinking that the Philadelphia Eagles will get some serious attention this year.
You really think so?
Yes, I do as they have several things going in their favor this year.
So why do you think they are going to improve so much?
Well, last year they had a rookie quarterback and although he started off good, he faded late.
You think he's going to improve enough to really help the team?
Yes, I think he got overwhelmed with all of the publicity last year and choked, but this year will be different.
I hope so as I would like to see someone actually beat New England for the Super Bowl this year.
The Eagles can do it and they have the talent to pull it off. Who do you think will be the surprise team?
Call me crazy, but I'm liking Tampa Bay to really turn some heads this season.
So Winston and the guys impressed you this off-season?
I wouldn't say that but I just think that they had so many injuries and close games last season, they will get better.
I have to agree that they did have some bad breaks last year.
Yep, if the ball bounces their way this season, they could make the playoffs
True, as once a team is in the playoffs, you never know what will happen
You know as that's why they play the game on the field and not on paper.
Either way, there is no telling what will happen this year.
Yep, only time will tell who makes it to the big game this year.
It should be a fun season regardless of who wins it all but I'm rooting for any team besides the Patriots.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the NFC this year?
I think it's a toss up between the Seahawks and Packers.
Have you heard about all the offseason drama with Seattle though?
No I thought they had a great offseason. What happened?
Apparently the locker room is pretty divided. The defense thinks Russell Wilson is getting special treatment.
I can see that, he is definitely treated like the golden child over there. Who do you think is behind the rumors?
Richard Sherman came out and made a statement in the media.
Wow, and he is definitely the emotional leader of that team. Which team might step up if the Seahawks dissapoints?
I like the Cardinals as a sleeper pick.
Really, even with an aging Carson Palmer and the loss of Calais Campbell?
Ya they have the best linebacking core in the NFC with the addition of Riddick.
Do you think the honey badger is going to stay healthy this season?
It's hard to say. I think if he makes it through the whole season, the Cardinals might have one of the better defenses in the NFL.
I could see that coming to fruition. Plus they have Bruce Arians who for my money might be the second best coach behind Bill Belicheck.
Ya I really like how outspoken he is. Speaking of Belicheck, is anyone going to be able to take down the Patriots in the AFC this year?
I wouldn't bet on it but I do like the Steelers.
Ya the one-two punch of La'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown is pretty unstoppable.
They are always on my radar for first round picks in my fantasy football league.
Absolutely. I'm not sure Big Ben Rothelisberger can handle too many more seasons though.
He takes a beating every year but somehow manages to play almost every game, it's incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you usually wear to NFL games?
I'm not sure I put much thought into it.
Not at all?
Maybe something comfortable?
So just, like, a t-shirt and jeans?
Something like that would be perfect.
I've never gone to one before. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wear a jersey or something.
I mean, you could if you wanted to.
I don't own one.
Then don't bother. The fun is just in going to a game.
What's it like?
What?
Being at an NFL game.
I think it's really exciting.
So you've been before?
When I lived in Denver, I used to go to Broncos games all the time.
Well, I'll try looking forward to it then.
Loosen up! You'll have fun.
I'm sure I will.
You definitely will!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite football team?
My favorite team is the New Orleans Saints.
Why is your favorite team the Saints?
I've just always liked them.  Since becoming interested in football, some players from my university have played for the Saints.  I'm sure that contributes.
What is your least favorite NFL team?
My least favorite NFL team is probably the New England Patriots.
Why don't you like the Patriots?
I think a lot of football fans don't like them because they've won the Super Bowl a lot.  I think it also has to do with the type of winners they are.
Have you ever been to an NFL game in person.
Yes.  For a short time my family had season tickets to the local NFL team.
Have you been to an NFL game recently?
I haven't had the opportunity recently.  We don't live in an NFL market, so it makes it harder to get to a game.
Do you still enjoy watching NFL games.
Yes, especially Saints games.  When I can't get Saints games in my television market, I'm likely to watch one of the games that is broadcast.
Do you just have cable, or do you subscribe to the NFL Broadcast package?
We don't have either, but I have subscribed to the package in the past.  We can still get local market games via antennae.
Which do you like more about the game of football, offense or defense?
While I get the importance of defense, and agree that's most often where a game is won or lost, I enjoy watching the offense more.
What would you change about the NFL?
What immediately comes to mind is the ongoing controversy with brain trauma.  I also think the game is slowing down, it needs to become more 'wide open'.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did you watch this year's NFL Draft?
Yeah I did. Not only did I watch it, I actually went to Philadelphia for it!
Wow, that's great! How was it?
It was cool. There was a lot of people!
Were there a lot of Packers fans there?
Yeah I guess. But it was 99% Eagles fans. Which I guess isn't surprising, but kinda is?
What do you mean?
I think I expected there to be a lot more of fans from other teams from around the entire NFL, but it was very Philly dominant.
Well, it was in Philadelphia. So that makes sense.
I mean, yeah, but you'd think there would have been a lot of travelers looking to experience it.
What team was second most in fans?
Actually. It probably was the Browns.
Wow really? Thats weird.
Yeah, well I guess it was their Super Bowl. Haha.
It isnt that close to Philly either. So that's interesting.
Yeah but there was some suspense around their pick. And now all their fans can say they were there when they took Miles Garrett.
....and not Mitch Trubiskey. haha.
Yeah that was probably the craziest part of the draft. Nobody saw that coming.
The Bears traded up ONE Pick for him!
Yeah they must have thought someone else was gonna trade up. It's going to be fun to look at in the future!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
Heck yes! NFL Season is less than 2 months away.
I know I finally get my Sunday's and Monday Nights back.
Word! I feel like season has been over forever.
It really does, NBA, NHL, MLB season have been boring. Need some NFL
Amen brother, plus a little Fantasy Football.
Just hearing those words gets me excited.
I know I won my league last year, but the Falcons for me came up short.
That was a heart breaking law in the Super Bowl.
Yep, team played not to lose, rather than go for the win.
Do you think Atlanta will have another magical season?
As long as Matty Ice, and Julio are healthy we should be fine.
They both should be fine this. That offense is amazing. Just need the defense to step up.
Yep, hopefully they learn from their mistakes.
Well my philosphy has always been, anybody but the Cowboys.
Not a fan either, as I can't stand Jerry Jones.
I have just never been a fan of them because of the self proclaimed "America's" team.
I hear ya there, as the Steelers are more American then them.
Exactly, as they have the lunch pale type attitude/blue collar America represents.
Regardless, lets go Falcons!! Super Bowl or bust!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw the 2014 AFC Divisional Playoff game.
The Patriots against the Ravens?
Yes, a good one.
If you were a Pats fan.
The Ravens had their chances.
They were ahead 14-0 in the first quarter, I remember.
But the Pats tied it in the second.
The Ravens untied it and lead 21-14 going into the half.
Flacco threw a pass to Owen Daniels.
It was a nice pass.
The Ravens scored again in the third, making it 28-14.
It started to look grim.
The Pats cut it to 28-21, Brady to the Gronk.
Then there was the trick play.
Yes, Brady to Edelman to Amendola.
It was really cool.
But the Ravens responded with a field goal.
The Pats finally got the go ahead touchdown.
Brady to LaFell.
That's all she wrote.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for another football season?
Definatly ready to watch the Patriots lose.
I hope i am so tired of Tom Brady.
He is to old to even be playing anymore and Bill Belichick the coach needs to go
I so agree with that
I really would like to see the Steelers and Ben Rothensberger win another superbowl.
I would like that out come.
Hey do you know why they have the Terrible towl or what it is for?
Yes it was created by Myron Cope in 1975 for the playoffs.
So they have had a Terrible Towl that long?
Yes they have and true Steelers fans protect those towels with their lives.
One year A group of Ravens fan were stomping on the Terrible Towls and their was a huge fight.
Wow i do remember hearing that one on the news the Ravens won by a hair.
Yes they did win but not the fight over the Terrible Towl.
So do you root for any other team besides the Steelers?
Yes I root for them But my Husband is a Saints fan.
Another quarterback that has seen bettter days.
Yes Drew Brees is still ok but hes getting to old for the game.
He is always complaining about something durning a game.
Yes and nothing is ever his fault.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you gonna go to the Steelers game next week?
Yes. What day is it ?
Next Saturday I think.
What team are they playing against?
The Tennessee Titans
Oh only one of the worst teams ever.
Why do you say that ?
Because they had a very big losing streak last year.
Your right, and when was the last time the Titans went to the playoffs?
I don't know school me.
Well, it's been a while. And they have only appeared in the Super Bowl once, but never won one superbowl
Wow. It makes you wonder how they stay in the league
They just keep switching coaches and hoping that the next one will do a better job
But they never do.
Well Im going to the game because I am from Tennessee
Oh is that why you continue to follow them
Exactly. You never know. They might improve over time
Yeah in like a 100 years
Ha ha ha ha  So your gonna go with me
Yeah I think I will watch them get the stuffing knocked outta them its alway fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do the winning players for the Super Bowl get?
They each get a ring and a bonus.
I figured about the bonus. How much do they get?
I think it's a little over one hundred thousand.
That's a huge bonus.
You know the losers get a bonus, too.
For losing the game?
I think of it more as an incentive to play their best.
So how much do they get?
They each got fifty three thousand dollars in this year's game.
So about half?
That sounds right.
Have the players always gotten bonuses?
Yes. It started with the first Super Bowl.
How much did they get?
The winners got fifteen thousand dollars and the losers got seventy five hundred.
So it was about half the money for the losers back then, too.
That's right.
That certainly is a good way to get the players to do their best.
I think that's the whole point of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about Dem' Boys?
Exactly, how about Dem' Boys.
Dak and Zeke taking them to the promised land this year?
Yes sir, I believe they will.
Have you noticed that Jerry Jones has become hands off?
Yes I have, that's why they are finally good again.
Garrett is a really good coach isn't he?
Yes he is. The first legit head coach since Parcells.
Parcells never had a quarterback.
That is correct, he didn't have one and Jones was on the sidelines all the time.
You would think Jones would have learned earlier how not to be Steinbrenner.
You would think that but he didn't.
Lee is one heck of a player also.
He's my favorite NFL linebacker at the moment.
The Cowboys are finally seeing some ROI on the Jerry dome.
Yes they are, and it's about time that America's team was back on top.
Have you been to a game in Arlington?
No, but the place looks big.
The Jerry Dome is huge and home to the largest TV in the world.
Forget a sophomore slump. Dak and Zeke are getting it done this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow NFL?
Only when my team plays, really.
Who is your team?
Used to be the Dolphins but now I like the Panthers.
I don't mind the Panthers, but the quarterback is such a cry baby!
No he is not and he can play!
Not so much last season, the season before he was good though...
Who is your team?
Still the Cards!
Man, they came close but never got the title!
Yeah, too close one time against the Steelers...
That was a bum game!
I thought the refs were totally biased!
I can't stand the Steelers!
Me either! Them Steelers and the patriots!
Ugh, yup Pats are another one!
What about the Raiders?
Oh my gosh! They really surprised us huh?
Totally! And they are going to Las Vegas?
So I hear! I think it fits, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello dear friend. Will you be partaking in the NFL football watching.
Oh yes dear sweet friend nothing would make me happier.
Will you feast during the football game?
Yes I will feast on succulent sweetbreads and fresh fruit as I watch NFL.
Succulent feast! Hurrah for football!
I will rejoice at the kick and the touchdown!
I will watch the muscular men run about as they chase dreams of excellence.
What team do you like best?
I like the Falcon and also the Oilers.
They are all warrior of grill Iron,  the players.
I agree with you dear sweet friend.
I hope the team Falcon does touchdown often and with great ferocity.
Yeas and the Bernie Kozar and the Refrigerator Perry play with a spirit of sportsmanship.
I will toast to Refrigerator Perry, master of NFL  footballs and the Grill Iron!
A toast of schlivovitz for him and his football game comrade.
My mind is filled with excitement about the game.
And mine as well.
The football is a game of excellence.
And the NFL is the excellence of leagues!
Tomorrow we watch football game and feast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of sports do you watch on TV?
Oh, all kinds. My favorite to watch is football.
Yeah, it's exciting. Do you catch all the games?
If possible. The one I never miss, if I can help it, is Monday Night Football.
Monday Night Football? I used to watch that a lot. Not so much any more.
How come you stopped?
Oh, no real reason. Just usually busy on Monday nights.
Yeah, I am too sometimes. But I always try to catch it, if I can.
I liked it when it was on ABC. It's not the same on ESPN, for some reason.
I agree. It's best early in the season, too. Those are the most exciting games.
Really? What's the difference?
Well, when it's early in the season, the records are brand new, you know. And the teams are usually showing off their new player additions.
Oh, yeah. That makes sense.
Also, at that point, you just don't know which teams are the strongest, who's gonna bounce back from a difficult start...that kind of thing.
Miami is my favorite team. I think they were the number one appearing team on MNF.
They were, definitely. The San Francisco 49ers come in second. I think they played something like 50 games.
Wow. What are the most often-seen match-ups, do you know?
Let me think ... Broncos vs. Raiders happened like 20 times. Same with Cowboys against Redskins.
That makes for some heavy rivalry.
Sure does. Some exciting games, for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They are still a solid team, but that proved to be a big loss last year.
Yea, they really didn't have much of a leader on the field.
Yea, Marshawn set the tone my example.
He just went out and played really hard, didn't he?
Yea, he really did. He gave it his all on the field always.
Yea, he has always been a man of few words, but he always tries to compete.
Yea, I agree. Well Seattle lost that to Oakland now.
Yea, they did and Oakland should have a great team this year.
Yea, it is time that they make some noise in the AFC.
I agree and I truly think that they will this year.
Yea, there is no reason that they shouldn't.
Yea, they are pretty much stacked.
I agree and having a good quarterback tops everything.
Yea and theirs got his money so he should be ready to compete.
I agree. Sometimes the money could lead a player both ways.
Yea, it can, but I think Carr is self motivated.
Yea, its just too bad they had a tough injury last year.
Yea, that was really sad.
Yea, just when they were trending upward, their main star got hurt.
Yea, but injuries happen. He will be back this year ready to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the Steelers win their 4th Super Bowl?
I believe it was Super Bowl XIV
What year was that?
1980
Oh, but it was for the 1979 season
Yes, that's right.
Do you know where they played that one?
Rose Bowl out in California.
Oh right. They used to play the Super Bowl out there.
Yes, but not recently.
Wow, who did they play that year?
The LA Rams.
Oh man, a hometown team playing in their own backyard.
Yeah, it wasn't very close though.
Did the Rams have any hall of famers back then?
Yes, Jackie Slater and Jack Youngblood.
Oh yeah, Youngblood was a defensive player
Yes, defensive end.
Did he play his entire career with the Rams.
Yes, yes he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, there are a lot of good teams in the NFL now.
Yea, many have a shot. Some of the same ones and some new ones.
Yea, theres a few teams lately that think they can win with just defenses.
Yea, I know exactly who you are thinking of.
Yea, Denver and Houston. What are they doing?
I mean, I know defense is important, but you need a quarterback.
Yea, can you tell those teams that.
Yea, especially Houston. I mean, I guess they tried and struck out with Osweiler, didn't they?
Yea, the joke is on them for that one.
I guess that was one smart decision that the Broncos made. Letting him walk.
Yea, that was one contract there were fortunate enough to not have given out.
Yea, that was a tough one. Not a good deal for Houston.
Well, yea and now they still have to find a quarterback.
I agree! Its hard to win without one.
Yea, even with that stellar defense.
Yea, thats not usually enough if you do not have a quarterback.
Yea, Denver won it all with subpar quarterback play, but that was still Payton Manning.
Exactly! At least he still brought something to the table.
Yea, he had leadership qualities.
Yea, that goes a long way toward winning as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think has the best stadium in the NFL?
Without a doubt, it's the Cowboys. The billion dollar playground.
Jerry Jones really loves to be a showoff. That stadium is insane.
The technology, design, and experience is bar none.
I bet. I would agree that the Cowboys have the best stadium. What other stadiums stand out?
I would have to say that Seattle's stadium is pretty spectacular as well.
Architecturally, it is a pretty stadium.
They did a good job with that stadium, especially making it unique.
It is definitely unique. What about the older stadiums like Soldier Field or Lambeau Field?
Those are great stadiums for other reasons. So much history in those stadiums.
I believe they gave Soldier Field a makeover a few years ago, didn't they?
I believe so. At it's core, it is still Soldier Field. I believe they gave it a makeover and added a few more seats.
Soldier Field does have so much history. Lambeau Field even more.
Lambeau Field should be on the registry of historic sites.
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't.
I don't think it is, but I could be wrong.
What do you think is the worst stadium in the NFL?
What is the stadium the Dolphins play in?
I don't know what they call it now, but I agree, it's had its day.
It has had its day. They should build a new stadium there instead of remodeling that stadium and giving it a new name every year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you excited about the Packers this season?
Of course, as long as Aaron is the quarterback.
I think he's the greatest quarterback in Packers history.
You think he' better than Favre?
I do!
What about Bart Starr?
Without a doubt.
What about Don "Magic Man" Magkowski?
Now you're being funny.`
I don't see anyone in the division overtaking them.
What about the Lions?
Nah, they have no defense.
What about the Vikings?
They don't have a good quarterback.
What about the Bears?
Now, you're making me laugh again.
Yea, I think they will go to the Superbowl.
You think they will win?
I don't know, New England is always tough.
Yea, it should be a good season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch football?
Every sunday.
Do you like Tom Brady?
Yep, he plays for my favorite team.
Mine too.
Do you think the patriots will win it all this year.
I think so.
Why?
Not many teams that can go toe to toe with them.
That's true.
Who do you think can beat them?
Broncos.
Why them?
One guy, Peyton Manning.
I'm not so sure.
He can pull off passes that even Brady can't.
He is a very good player.
His injury didn't seem to slow him down much.
He's still got a cannon.
Other than that team I don't think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'M GOING TO JOHN'S TO WATCH THE GAME SUNDAY. WANNA COME?
WHY WOULD YOU WASTE A BEAUTIFUL DAY INSIDE WATCHING A BUNCH OF MEN RUN AROUND IN THE MUD?ARE YOU KIDDING!
ARE YOU KIDDING! THE PATS ARE PLAYING THE FALCONS IN A REMATCH OF THE SUPER BOWL!
I HEARD ABOUT THE GAME BUT I'M NOT REALLY INTO FOOTBALL.
THAT'S CUZ YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE GAME OR KNOW ANY OF THE PLAYERS.
I KNOW ABOUT TOM BRADY, HE HAD AN ISSUE WITH A BALL GOING FLAT.
OMG! NOT THAT AGAIN!
WELL HE DID DIDN'T HE? IT WAS ALL OVER THE NEWS.
THERE IS MORE TO FOOTBALL THANTHAT.IT TAKES A LOT OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EFFORT.
I HEARD SOME OF THE PLAYERS STUDY BALLET DURING THE OFF SEASON TO HELP WITH AGILITY AND SPEED
I THINK YOU SHOULD COME SUNDAY AND WATCH THE GAME AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT YOU THINK.
I'LL COME BUT I DON'T THINK I'LL LEARN ANYTHING NEW.
WELL WE'LL SEE SUNDAY. MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT A BET ON THE GAME TO MAKE IT INTERESTING!
CARE TO HAVE A CONTEST ON STATS MR. FOOTBALL?
SURE LETS GO! I AM A WALKING FACT BOOK!
OK! FOR $5.00 WHO IS TIED WITH THE PATS FOR 5 WINNING SUPER BOWL GAMES, THE COWBOYS OR THE 49ERS?
RALLY AN EASY ONE?  IT WAS THE COWBOYS, THE 49ERS ONLY WON 4 BOWLS.
WRONG!  THEY ALL WON 5 GAMES!  HAND OVER MY 5!
OK FINE YOU WIN! YOU COMING SUNDAY?
CAN'T.  I HAVE TICKETS TO THE GAME! WANNA COME?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was wondering who had the biggest stadium in the NFL. Do you know?
That would be a good trivia question. Let's see yes it 's Metlife that holds 82,570 in New York for the Giants and the Jets
What about the smallest?
Lambeau Field for the Packers.
The Packers are owned by the city of Green Bay and is non-profit since 1923.
I had no idea. Are they the only ones?
I don't know but probably so.
I wonder who's stadium cost the most?
That would be MetLife Stadium 1.74 billion
holy sweet Jesus that better have come with heated seats and your own private toilet!!
Your funny! The Giants and The Jets own it together.
Kind of weird since they are rival teams.
How many stadiums have roofs?
Eight have roofs either retractable  or fixed
What fields are real grass?
Seventeen have fake grass and 14 play on real grass.
Interesting I wouldn't have thought it was that close.
I guess it has to do with the climate they are in as to which they prefer.
Well I am sure there is a cost factor in there as well.
I would want to have to be that person who decide on that expense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL season is almost here!
I can't wait. Should be a good year.
I have the Raiders to win it all.
No way, my money is on the Patriots.
The Patriots run is over. They got away from what made them great.
How do you figure that.
Their bread and butter was taking third stringers from another team and making them a star.
They have done that plenty of times.
Yeah, but this year they went and signed star players during free agency. Messed up their mojo.
Maybe, but Brady is still their.
Brady is a product of the system. He is good but their are alot of players that would be good in that system.
Well how are you picking the Raiders?
Dude, they were almost there last year until Carr broke his leg.
Yeah, him going down hurt them.
And they added players on offense that only makes them better.
Beastmode is washed up. He has been out a year and didn't do anything his last year in Seattle because he was hurt.
He has a year of rest and my personal oppinion is the last year in Seattle had more to do with not handing him the ball at the 1 yard line than injuries.
We shall see. I will say after the Patriots, the Raiders probably have the best shot.
The Raiders play the Pats in Mexico this year. That could be for the AFC.
Should be a good game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
EJ just got picked by the Bills.
I heard they grabbed him in the first round.
I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno.
I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field.
Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?
I can't imagine. He probably thought he'd get at least as much as EJ.
You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round.
Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them.
Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get.
Yeah, even Brees didn't get that short of a stick.
They did Flacco the same way.
If he starts enough games, he can be top tier after this contract.
He's young enough to bounce back on another team.
Geno may get less now, but he's on a better team.
Five years from now, Geno could easily get double what EJ makes five years from now.
It's a shame too. EJ's talent is wasted on the Bills.
The Bills wer better off spreading that money around.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?
I think 2 seasons left for Flacco.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the NFL season to start?
I am and pre-season should be starting soon thankfully.
What do you think of the Patriots?
I must admit, I am not a fan of the Patriots.
Even if you don't like them, you have to respect the team.
The patriots are a dirty team, both the head coach and quaterback have been involved in shady dealings.
Yes, I remember Tom and the infamous deflate-gate scandal.
Well the head coach Bill isn't a saint either.
Bill was known for the infamous spy-gate and stealing plays.
Even though they have won more super bowls than any other team, they will always have a black cloud over them.
How many super bowls has the Patriots won again?
Tom Brady has won 5 super bowls, more than any other player.
Wow, he has a ring for every finger on one hand.
As incredible as it sounds, Tom and Bill have always been known for their dirty tactics.
It is hard to respect a team that stoops to dirty tactics.
Well, despite how you feel towards the team, they have accomplished a lot.
Your right, starting in 2002, Tom Brady and the Patriots have racked up some super bowl rings.
I can't imagine there ever being a more dominant team in the NFL.
I can't either and Brady is coming back for another season.
Brady and Bill playing together is a great combination for a win, I am betting on them this year to win it all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many NFL teams are there?
That's a pretty basic question. I take it you aren't much of a fan.
Not really. I'll watch occassionally but I don't know much about it.
There are 32 teams split between two conferences and eight divisions.
That sounds complicated.
Not really. Each division has four teams and the Super Bowl is played by the two conference champions.
That makes sense I guess. So do the teams in the conference just play each other?
No. They all play across conferences, but each team plays the other three in their division twice.
How many games do they play in a season?
The regular season before playoffs is 16 games.
Oh, so six of the sixteen are from the same division, right?
Yes and the other ten are set by the NFL. There is a formula they follow to make sure each team plays every other at least once every four years.
That is really impressive. What does the formula look at?
There are a lot things. Way too hard to explain succinctly, but it ends up being 12 conference games and 4 non-conference games.
It is too bad they can't all play each other.
Well, that would double the season. I don't think that would work well for anyone.
Fans might like year round football.
In theory. But it would cause so many more injuries and players would burn out a lot faster.
That's true. I guess it wouldn't work.
As much as I love football, it is nice to have something to look forward to in August rather than watching all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best team in the NFC?
The Falcons
What about the AFC?
The Steelers
Really?
Yes
What about the Patriots?
They are okay
They won the Super Bowl
Yeah, so what?
That means they are worthy of recognition
I recognize then. But, I think the Stellers are better
Can I ask what team is your favorite?
The Steelers
I thought so
It's not just because I am a fan
Yes it is
They have the better team
The Patriots have so much more depth
They are just okay in my book
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi bro
What's up
Nothing much
Same
So I'm curious?
About what?
What's your favorite sport
Oh I am not sure
Why not
Because I am impartial to most
And?
Well I do like football
That's good fun right
Yeah it is
I love watching games
I only like NFL though
Nothing else
Nah NCAA is meh
I guess makes sense
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are a lot of great young running backs in the league.
Yeah, the position is kind of in vogue again.
Used to be a team was scared to draft a running back high.
They had a lot of busts at the position in the last 20 years or so.
Right, and a lot of money tied up in those busts.
True, but that was back when a top five pick made more than anyone on the team.
Yeah, the new salary cap rules are much better.
If you could take one running back right now to start a team, who's your workhorse?
Ezekiel Elliott, end of story.
Well, I was going to say the same thing.
Young, tons of mileage on the tires, no holes to his game.
He's probably making teams rethink their decision to draft guys in later rounds.
Yeah, his line helps, but he's got everything in place to be a MVP candidate.
How do you like Le'Veon Bell's chances?
Also tons of talent, most patient runner in the NFL.
But how does that translate to wins?
See, his line, while pretty good, just isn't the same as EE's.
I do think he's a step quicker and faster than Ezekiel.
Possibly, but he's not somebody who can grind you down.
Yeah, a real weapon in the passing game though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about football season?
I sure am.
Are you more into college football or NFL football?
I'm an NFL guy all the way.
Who is your favorite team?
I'm a Carolina Panther fan.
But you are from Wisconsin?
I know, but I love Cam Newton!
He is a great quarterback.
Yea, he had a rough year last year though.
I think he'll bounce back.
I do too.
Think the Panthers can win the division?
It's probably a bit of a long shot but maybe.
How many games do you think they win this year?
I'm guessing 9, but I'm hoping for many more.
They are an exciting team to watch.
This is true.
I think they win 11!
I think you are an optimist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many draft rounds are there for the NFL?
I believe there are seven.
Which team gets the first round pick?
I think it goes to the team with one of the worst season records.
Which NFL team had the worst record last year?
I believe it was the Cleveland Browns.
What night are games usually played in the NFL during the regular season?
They are played mainly on Sunday and Monday but can be played on any night if there is a rescheduling need.
When were the first NFL football games aired on television?
CBS put the first NFL game on television in 1962.
Names on teams can change over time in the NFL, right?
Yes, one of the strangest names ever used for a team was the "Eskimos".
How many games are played in a normal NFL season?
Each team plays sixteen games in a season.
When does the season usually begin in the fall?
I think it is the weekend after Labor Day in September.
What month does the NFL season usually end?
Usually it is in December, but technically, it could be early January.
Are there any female players in the NFL?
There has been a female kicker for the Jets before, but I do not know if she is still signed with them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, I just hope that some new teams will come through the ranks soon.
Yea, there are a couple teams that had really strong drafts and maybe that will help turn the tables.
Yea, I think it will pretty much be the same teams, but there are always a few new ones.
Who do you think will surprise this year?
Hmmmm maybe Tampa.
You think? Why so?
Well, Jameis Winson. That guy can play!
Yea, he sure can and with the addition of Desean Jackson, he has somebody he can count on down field.
Yea, that will help any quarterback and for him, it definitely should.
Yea, I think it is time that they start really competing.
Jamies has been in the league for a couple of years now and nows how to win, but it's time to put it all together.
I agree! He has it in him, but he just needs to do it.
Yea, he does. I think he will.
Yea, I agree. That was a good pick.
Thanks! I think Tennessee could surprise in the other conference as well.
Both teams have good young quarterbacks and a couple of playmakers around them.
Yea, that is usually the recipe for success.
It is and I think that it will work this time as well.
I agree! It might and I'm looking forward to seeing it.
Yea, it should be a good fun year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get season tickets for Titans this year?
No, I was thinking about that, though. I have a good feeling about them this season.
Yeah especially if Mariota comes back healthy.
At least he's not old like some other QB's.
I know some of them are getting up there though.
Right? Like Brady and Palmer...They are gonna need some new QB's.
Arizona has been struggling with getting good QB's it seems like...
Well, they had good ones, Kurt Warner, and Palmer's good, too. Just they seem to get them at the end of their career.
Isn't that the truth! Speaking of getting old, I think their Wide receivers are getting old too.
You mean Fitz? Floyd isn't that old yet, is he?
He's no spring chicken, but got some years left on him. Not sure about Larry' though.
He was slowing down a bit then made like massive comeback last couple of seasons.
Well, back to the Titans, we can share season tickets maybe.
Not a bad idea. I can only make it to about half the games anyway.
Sounds good, I'll check on the prices and such. I'd like to see who's playing here next season.
I'd like to see Raiders or Arizona.
Not Browns? Ha ha! they were horrible last year.
Yeah, to the point it's embarrassing!
I wouldn't mind watching the titans beat the Browns.
It may be a boring game though...
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL football is the best.
I agree. I am ready for the season to start.
Wouldn't it be cool to have a Superbowl ring?
I think I saw one sold on Pawn Stars.
I bet one of those rings costs a fortune. Do you know how many Superbowls there have been?
This next season will make 52.
Who plays in the Superbowl?
The conference champions from the AFC and NFC.
I heard the Steelers have the most Superbowl wins.
They do! They have six but the Patriots have the most Superbowl appearances.
How many do they have?
I think they have nine.
Bill Belichek has created a dynasty.
Do you think Tom Brady will get one more ring?
I think he will get at least one more. He has a lot of life left in him.
He takes really good care of his body.
You have to in such a physically demanding job.
There are a lot of injuries in the NFL.
Those guys get paid a lot of money though.
True. I would play a couple seasons and then retire.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you think is going to win it all this year, NFL-wise?
I've got to go with my Jets! I feel it this year!
Man, that's crazy! Who is your QB!?
Umm... I must admit.. I'm not entirely sure.
See! They're gonna be trash, once again!
I think it's still Fitzpatrick! He's decent!
Decent doesn't win championships!
He just needs the right cast around him.
More like a miracle around him!
Yeah, yeah. Let me guess... you think that the Saints are gonna take it all this year, huh?
AP is there, so you know it!
He's old now though. In his thirties!
So? So is Lynch, and you KNOW he's gonna tear the field up!
LaGarette Blount DID have the most TDs last season.
Whoa, whoa. No need to bring the "Cheatriots" into this conversation!
My bad. I know how much you hate them.
But yeah, the Saints just need a defense, and they made some good moves this offseason.
I like Brees, you know that much.
Oh, yeah. He deseres another one.
He is a QB in the most pure sense. I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you know when the Saints play against the Patriots?
No but ill look it up for you
That would be great
The play September 17
Does it say what time the game starts
It starts at noon  Who are you rooting for
The Saints of course.
Really you know Tom Brady will destroy Drew Brees.
I dont think so Tom Brady is way to old to be playing now
Seriously Tom Brady is 39 and Drew Brees is 38 Not much of a difference.
It doesnt matter the Patriots dont need to win the Saints are a better team
All the Saints do is pay 1 million dollars to a quarter back that claims nothing is ever his fault
Brees has a 1 million dollar arm
Tom Bradys arm is better them Brees and he didnt get 1 million in 2016
Who is the highest paid quarterback in the NFL right now
In 2016 Eli Manning was paid $24,200,000
Wow i wish i could make that in 5 years.
I know  Wonder what the players from the 80s and 90s are thinking right now
That they should have asked for way more.
Definatly i would have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can the Patriots success ever be repeated?
No I am sure we are seeing a run that will never be seen again.
Do you think 10 super bowl wins is their goal?
Yes I think that will be it and then they will walk away.
Belichick and Brady?
Yes and it wouldnt shock me to see Kraft sell the franchise.
Why do you say that?
Does he want to go through trying to spark this all up again?
They could have a backup and maybe Matt Patricia take over
Yeah but it will be a let down for sure.
No I dont think so.
None of Belichick's assistants have ever done anything.
Or the GMs who have left
Yeah Pioli ruined Kansas City
None of their backups have had much success either.
Maybe its just the system
It is and I dont know if Patricia can repeat that
Yeah I know what you mean by that
So this might be their run then they come back down to Earth
Boston fans are going to have a tough time with that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the practice footage for the upcoming game?
After watching that, I got back into the NFL again.
How do they pick these quarterbacks to start?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?
Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere.
Rodgers can be cast off as well.
Brady is not too far down on that list.
No, he's a good sport.
Oh, Brees has at least 3 seasons before they consider him.
So, Smith didn't press him.
He wasn't awful, but definitely not worth writing home about.
He started in 2011.
It's like the new coach is being set up to fail.
Dalton and Rogers got overlooked in the draft.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie.
They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you think will win the next superbowl?
The Broncos of course
When John Elway was playing football what number was he?
he was #7
Do you think the Raiders are a good team?
They are somewhat but I think the Broncos are better
Between the Cowboys and Bears who do you think will win?
I think the Bears will win handsdown
how many points is a touchdown worth?
six points
How is the game timing divided?
Games are divided into four 15-minute quarters, separated by a 12-minute break at halftime. There are also 2-minute breaks at the end of the first and third quarters as teams change ends of the field after every 15 minutes of play
What is the kickoff?
The ball is placed on a kicking tee at the defense's 30-yard line, and a special kicker (a "placekicker") kicks the ball to the offense
Are there any women football players?
Yes there are a couple
How do you become an NFL football player?
At the end of your Junior year of college, every player is offered a chance to leave college and sign up for the pro-draft. If you accept, your college career is over, and you may be drafted to an NFL team. If you decline, you can try again after your Senior year. Don't lose hope if you're not drafted.
who is the best football player of 2017?
Tom Brady
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me what do you make of the Texans this year?
I think they have a decent shot actually.
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing
They have a pretty easy schedule
Yeah? I haven't looked.
Its not to bad. They just have to finish out games strong
Well the D is solid at least.
I agree. Watt is just a beast!
I wonder if they can keep it all going still.
I think so.
If they get some offensive consistency then I think they will be fine
For sure. They have the players I think.
Its just going to be close games down to the wire.
I have to admit I love a strong D.
Yeah, but its bad for the bloood pressure
Sadly you are right.
I think overall though they have a good shot
True. They just have to be consistent
And keep their heads in the game
Yeah...fingers crossed
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite year of your favorite team?
I loved the 2007 Indianapolis Colts.
That's an odd choice.
The Colts are my team.
Is 2007 when they won the Super Bowl?
Yeah, we were the champions.
Who did they have on that team?
Peyton Manning was our quarterback.
Didn't they have Bob Sanders?
Yeah Bob was our free safety.
Bob Sanders was a beast.
Yeah he was great when he wasn't injured.
Who else did they have?
We had Dwight Freeny as our defense end.
Dwight was a great player.
We also had Reggie Wayne.
Did they have Marvin Harrison.
Oh yeah, Marvin was on that team.
That's a stacked team.
I agree. That's why we won the Super Bowl that year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey guess what!?
What?
NFL Training camp starts in three weeks!
I know! It feels like the season just ended!
I'm excited to see what happens with the Giants this year.
Me too. They didn't improve their offensive line in the off season though.
I'm not too worried about it. We made it to the playoffs with a terrible offensive line last season.
Your right! And Eli's legs appear to be made of stone, because he doesn't move in the pocket.
It's amazing they got as far as they did.
I think Eli's a smart quarter back and that's what carried them through the season.
Eli is a smart quarter back, but I honestly feel like he only shines in the post season.
Do you think he's saving it all for when it really counts.
No. I just think he performs better under pressure.
Yeah, he's pretty clutch.
He's also got OBJ catching his passes.
That dude is a beast! Definitely one of the best in the NFL.
Do you think he's one of the top three receivers?
Might be the best receiver in the league.
He's also got Marshall and Shepard.
Might be the best receiving core in the league!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope the Bears win this year.
So do I, but I think this year is going to be a rebuilding year.
We've got the best team in the country!
I wish that was true, but if you really look at the team, you know that's not true.
How can you say that.
Tom Brady is a powerhouse all by himself, and no team has a chance against that.
Yeah, but da Bears!
Haven't been a winning team since the 1970's/
Last year we almost made it to the playoffs.
AS a wild card.
Yeah, but we have the biggest and the best fans in the country.
Biggest maybe, but fans don't make the team.
I guess you're right.
Maybe we'll make it to the playoffs this year.
Your really think so?
No, but I hope we do.
So who do you think is going to win.
Either the Seahawks or the Patriots.
I'd really hate to see Tom Brady win again.
He is getting old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!  Season ticket holder!
Ohhh baby!
Yea man!
Which team?
Patriots
Oh a Pats fan, eh?
Yea, you too!
definitely!
You know I have an extra ticket for next week...
Oh?...
Yea I'm looking to sell
How much?
100..?
Hmm..
How about 90?
Okay, deal!
Awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think about the Dolphins quarterbacks this season?
Well, obviously you need to start with Ryan Tannehill.
He had that knee injury late last year, and I heard there were questions about his recovery during the off-season.
At this point it doesn't look like that will be an issue.  He will wear a brace, but he has looked good in camps so far.
Yeas, but those are just camps.
That is true, we won't know for sure until games start and he needs to put stress on the knee or he takes a hit.
What about his progress as a quaterback?
This is his second season under Adam Gase, and it looks like he has really started to improve.
We have heard that before with him.
I know, but his progress does seem pretty genuine.  He looks like the leader this team needs.
What about his problems with accuracy on the deep ball.
If you look at his numbers from last year, you will see that stat is actually misrepresented.  When his line gave him time, he was one of the better deep passers in the league.
What about his troubles on third down and in the red zone?
More experience for the team in the offense should help, as should the addition of Julius Thomas.
How about the backup quarterbacks.
Matt Moore is back as the primary backup, and he is one of the best in the league.
So, no worries there.  What about the future?
They have a couple young players in Brandon Doughty and David Fales.
Neither of them is replacing Matt Moore.
True, they are both projects.  Their job right now is to learn and see how they develop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi are you reading the NFL page on ESPN.com?
Yes I am! I am catching up on news for my favorite NF team.
Really who is your favorite team?
Dallas cowboys. I really love Zeke!
Oh I do too! Zeke Elliot is such a great running back for the team.
He is one of the reasons that the team did so great last year.
Yea I know Dak Prescott and Zeke are just what the Cowboys needed to get back in the playoffs.
It is a shame that with the regular season they had that they bombed in the playoffs.
I know! I really though the cowboys would make it to the superbowl.
I guess it just wasn't the cowboys year. I really wish someone would win besides New England Patriots.
I agree. Tom Brady is hot but after deflategate, I just do not like him or that team.
I think that besides the Raiders really have a chance next year.
They are ok. The defense is looking better with Bruce Irvin and Karl Joseph.
Yea but the Raiders QB isn't too bad either.
Yea Derek Carr isn't too bad. If he is healthy this year, they will have a chance to go far in the playoffs.
Yea can you imagine the Cowboys vs the Raiders in the superbowl?
Yea that would be great since Raiders are AFC and Cowboys are NFC.
I would take a miracle for both teams to win their conferences though.
Probably. It seems when both team are starting to have a good season, a injury occurs.
Lets hope for a great season for both!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just read that Knile Davis is learning the playbook for this year. It's about time.
Yes he is. With his speed, the Packers will rule this year.
He didn't play much last year.
That's probably because he didn't know the playbook well.
Didn't Aaron Rodgers say something about him not being ready?
I'm not sure, but I read that the coach mentioned it.
I knew someone said it. Do you think they'll do good this year?
I think with his speed and Aaron's abilities, they'll make a great pair!
Isn't Aaron getting old?
He's only 33! I think he's still got some great years ahead.
I'll stick with my Panthers.
Has Cam recovered for this year?
I read that he's doing well at practice and should be playing.
He's a pretty good quarterback.
Yes he is. He's always underrated though.
That happens a lot. He's no Aaron Rodgers, but I still recognize his abilities.
He's getting better and better!
I doubt he'll ever be as good as Aaron, though.
I guess time will tell, my friend!
Yes, we shall see!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the NFC East back?
No too mediocre.
Cowboys favored to win division right?
I like the Eagles.
Why is that?
Like the addition that made at wide receiver.
Yeah, but Dak Prescott a winner.
He hasn't performed well when the running game isn't supporting him.
What about other divisional teams?
Washington wasn't committal on Cousins as there franchise QB.
I think he is better than Prescott.
Yeah but Wentz has the most ability with arguably the least amount of talent around him.
Who passes for more yards this year, Wentz or Prescott?
Wentz no question.
Probably right, Cowboys a run-first team.
Elliot so good behind that line.
Who is starting for Giants?
No idea, probably a platoon situation.
Remember the days when one back got 300 carries a year?
Sure do. That won't happen again with the way teams throw the ball nowadays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You say that NFL football is your favorite sport to watch.
On television.
Not in person?
It's o.k. in person, but basketball would be my favorite to go to.
Why's that; isn't football exciting in person?
Yes, but there are too many delays--huddle times mostly.
The no huddle offense has changed that.
Not really--the quarterback mainly stands there looking over the defense and calling signals and it's not much faster, unless they are in hurry up mode.
And television?
Instant replay; now instead of sitting there watching nothing, you get to see the play again.
And an expert commentator explaining what happened.
And John Madden getting excited over a lineman's block.
You know, Madden retired.
I know; I miss him.
Yes, instant replay has changed the game and made you appreciate the subtleties.
I do have a problem with it.
What's that.
When I go to a game, I don't watch carefully, expecting to see it better on replay.
Well, there is jumbotron.
Well, that's not the same as a television replay at home, and I even find myself waiting for replay at other events
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Eagles will be any good this year?
I don't know- I think a lot of it will depend on how their QB does.
I thought Carson Wentz looked promising last season
I hope so- the Eagles need some stability in their roster- especially at QB.
Yea its been a revolving door since NcNabb and maybe Vick. Its like every year there is a new guy.
But a QB still needs a good group of players around him- not sure if we have a strong offense
Sproles is getting old isn't he and Marshall is just good. What about wide-outs?
We used to be so good with DeShawn Jackson....remember?
Yea but they got Torrey Smith from the Ravens didn't they? And Alshon Jeffrey?
Thats true- both are good- but I worry Torrey Smith is too old as well.
I am excited to see what another year with Pederson will be like since he spent last year undoing a lot of problems
True, I think Chip Kelly really screwed up the Eagles in so many ways- it may take another year to get it back to form.
Maybe. I loved Andy Reid but it was time for him to go- too many post seasons ending too soon
I liked him too, but I was ok with the decision for something new- but Chip Kelly was not a good fit.
I think Pederson could be good- but Laurie and Roseman needs to get him a good staff to work with
True- the pre seaon is starting soon so we should see
Still I am most excited about Carson Wentz- especially after a full season under his belt
And a more veteran team to work with this year
I hope he works out- it would be great to have a franchise quarterback to build a team around
Agreed- let the Carson Wentz era begin!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey who is your team this year?
Oh you know I got the Panthers!
What makes you say that?
They almost went perfect two years ago, had a slight hiccup last year.
I'd say more than a hiccup.
They had a bad year, but Benjamin will be back, and Mccaffery could be what the team needs.
Yeah I admit Christian could be a stud.
He'll fill that slot WR or RB position, and no Linebacker will be able to cover him.
Yeah he is going to seriously create some matchup problems.
Plus with Greg Olsen still in his prime. The offense will be unstoppable.
I think it all depends on Cam.
Yeah you got to hope that he has a good attitude, and stays that way.
Yeah, I just didn't like what I saw from him in the Super Bowl two years ago when the Broncos beat them.
Yeah that play where he didn't really go after the ball I think was a real bad look for him.
I think you just gotta hope that Ron Rivera keeps them playing well.
Yeah he's a really good coach that doesn't get enough credit.
He's done so much for that team.
I don't know, with guys like Kuechly and Cam running the team, he should be doing better.
I guess i can agree with that. we've got some players in their prime that aren't gonna be great forever.
Yeah, and guys like Kuechly, you never know if he's played his last snap due to injury.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you still a San Francisco 49ers fan ?
No, I have a new team this year. I'm tired of waiting for them to win.
Who is your new team?
The Jacksonville Jaguars, they are not a good team, but I did move to Jacksonville this year.
I wondered if you would start following them after your move.
I've always lived in Florida and followed all the teams, but this is the first time I've lived in a city with an NFL team.
How far away from the stadium do you live?
I can see Everbank Field from in front of my apartment. I think it's about a mile away.
Wow, that's close, I guess I'll be spending some weekends visiting you this year.
That sounds great, we'll have to plan out some weekends when the Jags are playing at home.
Hopefully they will play the Tennessee Titans in Jacksonville this year.
The Titans play the Jaguars in week 2 this year, and it's at Everbank Field.
I will be sure to come and watch that game with you this year.
That will be a lot of fun, I've never been to an game in person yet.
I will of course have to be wearing my Titans shirt to go.
I will have to buy a Jaguars jersey before I go to the stadium.
Are you going to be embarrassed to be seen with me in the Jacksonville stadium with my Titans jersey on?
It depend on which team wins.
I'm sure the winning team will be my Titans.
I'm sure that you are wrong, the Jags are going to have a great year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
EJ just got picked by the Bills.
After watching that, I got back into the NFL again.
How do they pick these quarterbacks to start?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?
No, says the guy who's team got screwed by replacement referees.
Did Steven A interviewed Manning?
I guess they can improve once their head coach is gone.
Have you caught any of the St Louis games.
Oh, Brees has at least 3 seasons before they consider him.
Let's hope Flacco's new contract can get him to the finals.
It shouldn't take him more than two seasons to hit the finals.
Ej's not evne that bad. Six years with the Bills is more of a punishment.
I think he's doing alright, but the Bears are quick to get rid of coaches.
Either than or they trying to makes sure the team doesn't sale.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
Ben, Brees, Romo, these guys would kill to play alongside Manning not Brady.
I want him back next season, but it's pointless if he's still injuried.
Dalton, can't be that picky. It's not like he's going to get on a playoff team.
That may be but he won't be getting as big of an offer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cowboys are that squad bro
LOL...call me when they win a playoff game
They will this year
They will never win a playoff game. I have put the official hex on them
You're crazy man, no such thing as a hex
Have they won a playoff game in 10 year?
No...so what?
Then the hex works...LOL
You're so funny dude...NOT Lol
I'm just saying. The Dallas rube is in the basement
You shouldn't have told me that, man LOL
I guess I'll go down and rub it right now
Cold blooded man, cold blodded...lol
I do like Zeke and Dak, nice combination
Best in the NFL last year....
...not to win a playoff game...LOL
Man you back on that again?
Yup, until they win one...
Ok, fine. This is their year,
Not it isn't, Not at all. No sir
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Vikings bounce back this year?
Yes I do.
Remember they started out 5-0 last year.
They looked unbeatable.
Yes they did.
Then they went 3-8 after that.
Right down the drain.
Well the first two games can be tough.
Who do they play?
They open at home with the saints.
A tough game.
Then they go to Pittsburgh.
Very tough game.
Then home vs Tampa.
Another tough one.
Then home for division rivals Detroit.
Then week 5 is at Chicago.
They won't start out 5-0 this year
I don't think so either.
Maybe they can go 3-2
XXXXXXXXXXX
O.K. the other day we talked about the greatest NFL team of all time--who was the greatest player?
You know, I've actually thought about this, and I think you have to do it by position.
Why is that?
Well, the quarterbacks have the biggest impact these days, but they are not the best athletes.
O.K., who are?
The running backs.
All right, I'll go with you.  Who is the greatest running back of all time?
Well, Jim Brown would say it is Jim Brown.
He might be right, but since we didn't see him that much, let's eliminate him from the discussion.
Agreed.
I'll throw out O.J. Simpson.
Because of his troubles?
No, I didn't mean discard him--I meant consider him.
Oh, pretty darn good--playing in the Buffalo weather on poor teams hurts his ranking.
Well, if all the games we're on artificial turf, I'd go with Barry Sanders.
Agreed.  Dickerson has the most yards, but I was never a big fan.
Yeah, big and powerful, but the elusive backs are more fun.
For sure, like Gale Sayers.
Oh, my; he scored, I think, six touchdowns once against my Niners.
Let's consider Adrian Peterson and move on--I'd take any of the guys we've talked about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the Superbowl this year?
Hmm.. that's a really tough choice.
Is it really?
I guess not. I'm taking Pittsburgh.
Because they're good or because you love Big Ben.
Can it be both?
I guess so. I think it's the Cowboy's year.
You say that every year.
Yeah I know, but I really mean it this year.
That's what you said last year.
Last year was just a warm up.
It was a good run.
And this year is going to be even better.
How so?
The cowboy's are going to be undefeated Superbowl champs.
Do you want to bet on it?
Sure! how much?
How about $200?
Can we bet $20 instead?
I guess you're not that confident.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think has the best receiving corps in the NFL?
That is a tough one.  I think the New York Giants receivers are all really, really good.
Do you think they are better than the Patriots receivers?
I think the Patriots have a more balanced team with the running game and the looks they can give defenses, but I think based off talent alone, the Giants receivers are better.
Patriots did add Brandin Crooks to Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski.
Yes, but the Giants have Odell Beckham Jr., Sterling Shephard, and they added Brandon Marshall.
Marshall is an injury risk though, and sometimes does not do well with his teammates.
Team chemistry is a concern, but the talent is there.
How do you think the Giants stack up against the receivers of some of the other NFL teams.
I like the Giants as the best in the NFL.  Other good teams with good receiving corps, to me, are the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, and the Atlanta Falcons.
Now I really like the Falcons receivers, I think they can get back to the Super Bowl with those guys.
They certainly have a great chance to do that.  Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu, and Tyler Gabriel are great receivers.  Plus, they have Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman.
It will be interesting to see the divisional games between the Falcons and the Bucs though.
For sure.  The Buccaneers added DeSean Jackson to Mike Evans.  That move alone puts two big time play makers on the field on the outsides.
That combination resembles what the Steelers have in Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant.
That is a good comparison actually.
Yea, I feel like Jameis Winston compares nicely to Big Ben when Ben was younger.
Interesting comparison.  Winston has a cannon for an arm, and his ability to be just mobile enough is where they are similar.  Winston's accuracy is a big question mark in my opinion.
Well, Winston was just a rookie last year.
True, but accuracy is a must have trait in an NFL Quarterback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
must be hard being a bills fan
yeah right
losing 4 super bowls in a row
thats crazy
i think the lost 4 in a row because of how the lost the first
maybe
how do you miss that field goal
you kick it wide
well i know that
well you asked
i mean how do you miss it
pressure on him
had to be a lot
well yeah. its the super bowl
sill have to do your job
that you do
but Wr drop passes all the time and nobody bats an eye
they would if they dropped it in the endzone with no time on the clock
your right
im always right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best Manning?
Eli
I think it is Peyton
No way. Eli beat Tom Brady twice
So what?
That means something. Peyton won because of his defense.
That's not true
yes it is
Peyton had better career numbers
But, Eli was more clutch
That is a good point
Remember the Patriots game?
The Super Bowl?
Yes, and they were undefeated
True
Eli beat an undefeated team, in the Super Bowl
Good point
So are you on my side now?
Yes I am
Alright. Eli all the way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there!  How 'bout them Cowboys?
What about them?  Their 4 defensive players arrested so far this year?
LOL.  It is the offseason.
True.  However, they will miss games due to team or league rules.
Yeah.  They will be early season games though.
Probably, but remember Dallas has collapsed the past few years late in the season.
Yeah, other than last year, they usually end up playing for the division in the last game of the year.
On NBC's Sunday Night Football.
They lost those games.
They didn't make the playoffs.
Win the division and you're in.
Lose and you go home.
This didn't happen last year though.
No, but Aaron Rodgers picked apart their defense.
Yeah, he had one of the greatest seasons of all time though.
He did, but keep in mind that Green Bay lost their receiver and running back.
They had a guy with a number in the 80s playing running back.
Yeah, that is crazy.
Hopefully Dak Prescott will be better.
He might be, but then again, defense may learn how to play him better too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will make the Super Bowl this year?
I don't know man, its way too early.
Okay, but just for fun. Take a stab at it.
Hmm. I'll say Packers and Patriots.
Ahh come on. That's boring. That's basically like picking all the #1 seeds in an NCAA bracket.
Well, they both re-loaded in the offseason.
Okay, but if you had to pick two sleeper picks for the Super Bowl, what would you say?
Hmmm. I'll say the Chargers and the Buccaneers
Whoa, I've heard a lot of hype about Tampa Bay, but not really for San Diego.
Yeah, I just think they have a lot of good pieces on offense and the AFC is pretty open after the Patriots.
I don't know much about their defense.
Neither do I, but look at Rivers, Gordon, Gates, and Keenan Allen.
Oh wow I forgot about Keenan Allen after his injury last year.
Yeah he's a monster when healthy.
Yeah last year I predicted him to be a top 5 fantasy WR, and took him in the 2nd round.
Ouch that hurts.
Well, I'm sure the injury hurt worse for him, but yeah.
You know what else has got to hurt? The Chargers are leaving San Diego after the year.
Yeah that's a complete shame. The Chargers belong in San Diego.
Yup, but a team in Vegas will be fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how do you think the Eagles are going to do this year?
Honestly, I'm not quite sure. I hope Carson Wentz doesn't experience his sophomore slump.
I don't think he will, after his play last year. He was undefeated through the first four games.
Yeah, but things kinda fell apart after that.
I don't think you can blame the remainder of the season solely on the quarterback.
True, but he does set the tone for the team.
I just hope they beat the Cowboys this year, I'm sick of hearing about Dak and Zeke.
They did do well, but I think others teams will figure them out. They were so one dimensional.
Yeah, I hope our revamped defense is up to the challenge.
I don't see any other team troubling us, except, maybe, the Giants.
Yeah, it's hard to tell what team will show up when we play "Big Blue."
I would love to see them beat New York and Dallas at least once each, or sweep one of them.
If we did, I bet we make the playoffs.
That would be so cool.
Yeah, the City would love it, especially after the way they turned out for the draft this year.
Did you go?
I was there the first night. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Yeah, I hope they do that again. The NFL knows how to throw a party.
Are you planning on going to any games this year?
One for sure. How about you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your favorite NFL teams?
Well I'm a big Dolphins and Raiders fan.
That is a very interesting combination - why them?
Well I grew up in South Florida and I like the players on the Raiders.
What do you think about the recent movement of the Raiders?
I think it was needed - Las Vegas will be interesting.
Yes, I think so too, that city needed a sports team.
I agree, it is definitely an interesting location for a squad.
I think the Raiders will have another surprise season.
Last season was great before the quarterback went down.
Yes, they were a nice surprise.
And they made the playoffs, too!
Who do you think are the best NFL coaches?
Well I really think Bill Belichick is up there.
Hard to argue against that.
I also think that the Packers coach is pretty great.
Mike McCarthy?
Yes, he is great - as well as Pete Carroll.
I love his South California demeanor.
He seems very laid back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Lions are going to do this year?
I don't know... last year was so weird.
Stafford is getting older now too
And they lost Megatron...they will probably go 8-8
You think so? I have them at a perfect season again, 0-16.
oh- come on.They won't be that bad. You should at least have them at 4-12
Right. But, you know, they are totally going to lose against Green Bay.
Right, but, c'mon, they can beat the Bears.... maybe not the Vikings.
Well... alright, I'll give you the Bears. who do you think will be #1 in the nfc North?
I think it is going to be Green Bay again
Yeah.. me too. They were doing so badly last year and had to screw it up and win
I don't care if the Lions are losing, but when Green Bay is losing, it really makes my weekend.
Who is going to win it all?
I think the Patriots. I know, LOL, a boring guess.
I think it is going to be the Browns
What?no way! they can't beat an elementary school girl scout football team!
I know... I was kidding... I really hope that Green Bay doesn't get in
Who do you think will be the best quaterback
That kid from the Cowboys... I forgot his name
Me, too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo J.D., did you by chance see the new Chargers stadium being built?
I didn't catch that one, are they still in San Diego?
You know I am a Titans fan, but our city finally has a stadium!
There is a stadium in Los Angeles, the Chargers are here now?
Yeah dude we have two teams, we run this sport!
Wow, the Rams are with us too?
It seems so man, the new stadium should be here by 2020.
We gotta head to a few games, I would love our team vs any top squads.
This means we have to get jerseys and pick a new favorite player!
Then so be it, we finally have a legitimate football team!
We also have a legitimate stadium and we don't have to resort to driving so far.
That is a big thing, I would watch more sports if I didn't have to drive two cities away.
I wonder if we have the budget to recruit any amazing players?
Los Angeles always good money, we may just have to wait for prospects.
I'm looking forward to smashing the AFC West when we get there.
It will definitely be a long road to the conferences and championship.
If the Chargers make it to the Superbowl I am going to go!
Those tickets will be thousands of dollars!
When else can we represent a football team without moving to another state?
You make a great point, let's do it!

Watching these reruns of Hard Knocks is making me excited for this season
Was it the one with the LA Rams?
Yeah that series. It's such an interesting look into the locker room
I don't make it a point to watch them, besides the season with the Jets
That season was legendary for the show.
Rex Ryan's temperament really made that series hilarious.
It does. It's a shame that series is from when the Jets were competing in AFC title matches.
That collapse happened so quickly. I feel your pain to a degree being a Bengals fan.
Their history is probably nearly as bad my Jets history. We still cling onto Namath from the late 60s.
Do you ever think that Namath was probably one of the most overrated Hall of Famers ever?
Honestly, yes. He wasn't a good player at all.
He had a few seasosn where he led the league in passing yards I think.
I believe he did, but if you look at his statistics they were brutal.
Didn't he finish with more interceptions than touchdowns
.That's an understatement my friend. He had a 173:220 Touchdown to interception ratio.
So he couldn't even manage a 1:1 ratio?
Nope. They always say it's because the football of the 20th century was a lot more physical, especially with defensive backs, but come on.
People like Mel Blount would abuse you at the line, but jeez that means you look elsewhere if hes mugging your receiver.
Exactly. Namath's stats just mean he slung the thing regardless. You don't nearly 50 interceptions more just because of an era of football.
He seems like an overrated version of Favre, except Favre threw more TDs than INTs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the NFL season?
Absolutely, I am ready to tailgate!
Do you think it will be a new team to win this year.
I hope the Bears win, what about you?
I would rather the Chiefs win.
I'm sick of seeing the same teams in the superbowl.
I agree completely, it seems the Paitroits are always in it.
That's what happens when you cheat to win.
Or just deflate a ball over and over.
What other teams would you want to see in the Superbowl.
Well if it was not my number one pick it would have to be the Packers.
I would say the Colts.
But both teams have been in it before.
Just as long as it is not the Raiders!
Yeah the Raiders are my most hated team.
Broncos would also be nice.
Indeed, I really just want a midwest team to win.
Would that include the Vikings?
No way! I will never route for the Vikings
Or the 49ers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the Seattle Seahawks could make another Super Bowl appearance this year?
That team is past its prime and will likely relinquish their grip on the NFC West within the next three years.
Seattle has a great quarterback and dominant defense. What more could you want?
Russell Wilson is an undersized game manager.
That's unfair! He's probably one of the most accurate and mature quarterbacks in the NFL right now.
From everything I hear, he's a great guy. However, if you put him on a bad team, he probably couldn't make them win.
Now we're getting into hypothetical territory. You still haven't addressed their defense.
The Seahawks defense was all-time great two or three years ago. Now they're just old and overpaid.
Harsh! You don't think that the Legion of Boom is still one of the top defensive secondaries in the league?
They're way too injury prone. Last season, Earl Thomas broke his tibia before the playoffs and they apparently didn't even report Richard Sherman's sprained MCL.
Football players are always playing through injury. I'm sure that there are a lot of banged up players that we don't know about in the NFL.
When you couple the injuries with their increasing ages and their large contracts, I don't see how Seattle can continue to compete moving forward.
Seattle still has one of the best front offices with John Schneider as GM. This is the guy who picked Russell Wilson, Richard Sherman, and Kam Chancellor in the later rounds of the draft after all.
True, but I haven't seen any great late round draft picks from Seattle in the last two seasons. Moreover, I keep reading reports of tensions between the players in the Seattle locker room.
Are you referring to the alleged Richard Sherman-Russell Wilson feud?
I'm more so referring to how Pete Carroll takes such a hands off attitude in controlling players that it ultimately manifests in a lack of discipline. Richard Sherman should not have been able to yell at a coach last season regarding an offensive play call.
I feel that Pete Carroll's light touch approach allows the players to relax and play better. Also, Richard Sherman was right about that offensive call.
Whether he was right or wrong is an entirely different subject. My argument is that you can't run a team where everyone is trying to lead.
Until that light touch approach begins to manifest itself on the football field, I won't criticize Pete Carroll for it. I saw an interview with Michael Bennett the other week and he said that Carroll's light touch approach was useful in attracting free agents to the team.
Maybe that's true, but I would say that Seattle's recent success coupled with Washington's lack of an income tax play bigger factors in attracting free agents.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Jerry Rice was the best.
Maybe
Why not.
I think he was good for that style of offense
He wouldn't have been in another type
He might have been but was perfect for that one
So if not him. Then who?
Good question
Well answer it
Randy Moss
Thats not bad
He's not bad
Always brought problems with him though
He did but you couldn't look past the talent
He had talent
Just look at what he did on the patriots
That was insane
look who the QB was
Brady
Enough said
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team has the best color?
What sport?
NFL
I think the Vikings have the best colors
Me too
Who is second?
The Panthers
I was gonna say them too
I love the blue and black
It is really appealing
Do you like their team?
They are okay
Do you like their quarterback?
Not really
It's Cam Newton right?
Yes
Did you see him in the Superbowl?
Yes
Did he play good?
Not at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football season is starting back up soon.
Oh joy.
I take it you don't like football.
Let's put it this way.  The Superbowl could be played in our backyard and I would still not watch it.
Ouch.  It's a cool sport.
Cool??  A bunch of guys running around and tackling each other just to get a ball.
And they get touchdowns, fans cheer and they win games and if they're really good they can make millions.
That's another thing.  How are they paid so much?  It's ridiculous.
They bring in the money.
So??  They make more in one year than a lot of more deserving people combined
It's not about who deserves what.  It's the excitement of the game.
Isn't it all the same after awhile??  Get the ball, run, tackle, touchdown, kick..repeat
Oh and I suppose baseball is better.
I didn't say that.  I just find football really boring.
It's so unpredictable though.  Who will win, who will get hurt, will there be a fight?
You can watch Survivor if you want that.
Some of these players are amazing though.  Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Joe Montana AKA The Comeback Kid
At least you didn't say OJ Simpson.
Well he was a hell of a player.
Not convinced, sorry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Super Bowl do you remember the most?
Probably Super Bowl XXII?
Really, why do you say that?
It was one of the biggest scoring quarters of all time?
Who played in that one?
Broncos and Redskins.
Oh yeah, that's the one where Denver opened with a lead.
Yep, and then were crushed in the 2nd quarter.
Right, 35 points.
And then they scored another 7 in the 4th to ice the game.
Man, did Denver score again.
Nope, 10 points in the first quarter and that was it.
Wow, 2nd straight loss for John Elway?
Yes, and Dan Reeves.
Yeah, Reeves never one the big one.
Nope. Went multiple times, but could never pull of a win.
How embarrassing
Well, not as embarrassing as the Bills.
Oh yeah, that was horrible.
Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite football team?
I love the Pittsburgh Steelers what is your favorite team?
I like the Denver Broncos I was so upset when Manning retired, but he was at the age it wasn't worth the risk.
Yeah he was a little over the normal retirement age for football players, but he is still active in football.
I heard he was hired on by Riddell as an adviser that is pretty cool.  Who was your favorite retired football player?
I loved Troy Polamalu I even named my lizard after him I was so sad when he played his last game.
Hey he was the head and shoulders guy I loved those commercials.
Yeah he did a lot of those commercials but he was the Safety for the Steelers. One of the best safety's there was.
What is he up to since he retired?
He writes movie reviews on his twitter but he was in the new Disney movie Moana, was cast as man one.
Wow football player turned actor that's interesting.
No he's not an actor he even said that in a recent interview, he just had fun saying his line in the movie.
Sounds like both our favorite retired players are having a great retirement. Are you excited for preseason to start?
I'm super excited I think the Steelers picked some great players this draft. We picked up TJ Watts, JJ watts brother.
That is a great pick I'm sure he will give the Steelers a lot of wins this season.
Who was the best player you think the Broncos drafted?
I think Garett Bolles was a great pick we really needed a new offensive tackle.
I haven't looked at his stats but I'm sure he'll do great in Denver.
Yeah I think both our teams will have a great preseason and regular season.
Hope both our teams make the play-offs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really excited for the upcoming season.
Yeah, me too.  I'm thinking New England is the team to beat again.
I know, still in shock on what they did to Atlanta last year.
That may be the biggest choke job every.  Can believe they blew that lead.
They will come out on fire this year but will have a hard time winning that division.
Carolina will be tough to be know that they will have a run game.
Even Tampa will push them, their offense looks good and they have a solid quick defense.
I'm not sure who will come out of the NFC.  Seattle and Green Bay should still be tough, thinking Dallas declines a little.
I hope Dallas is terrible, they are my least favorite team.
The way they run the ball is crazy.
Best O-line in the league.  They blow the defense back 5 years before Elliot hits the line.
I'm rooting for Washington, I want to see Cousins throw for 5,000 yards.
I'm surprised they have not given hit a long term deal.
Well they'll need to next year if they want to keep him.  He needs to cut down the INT's though.
Does it matter?  It's New Englands league to lose.
They are they best all around team.  I'm sick of seeing them win.
I want them to make the playoffs and lose by about 70 in the first round
That would be awesome, watching Brady turn into a turn over machine.
He needs to retire so there can be some new blood in the AFC.
I'd like to see the Raiders, take them down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for those Cowboys?
Of course! They have a really good shot this year.
Dak Prescott almost led them to the Super Bowl last year.
He had a great season.
It was still a shame to see Romo injured again.
Probably a good thing he retired this year.
Any idea what he is going to do in retirement?
I heard Romo is going to be a broadcaster for CBS.
Are there any other big names retiring this year?
Jay Cutler and Mike Vick are both retiring.
Those guys haven't been relevant in years.
I agree but they were star players at one time.
That is true. Mike Vick was a dual threat in Atlanta.
That guy could run the ball.
Do you think Dez Bryant will have a good season.
I think so. He is one of my favorite players.
I would love to visit Dallas's stadium.
I plan on going next season. I have to save up for tickets.
I bet Jerry Jones has made his money back.
I am sure he has. They sold out most of their games last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best QB in NFL history?
Oh thats a tough one.
I would say its got to be Tom brady.
No way, there have to be so many more that are better
Like who? Brady has so many rings, so many awards.
Montana, Elway, Kelly, Marino just to name a few.
Marino? you're nuts he never even won a superbowl.
Is that the measure? Because statistically hes one of the best.
Well that has to be part of the conversation. If you can't win a championship how good are you?
Ok, lets exclude Marino, Then who?
Well Elway won a couple superbowls, so did Montana.
Ok, I'll agree with you that those are top level QBs and certainly among the elite but not better than Brady.
They were dominant as passers in a league that favored running. Put them in the league now and they are at the top.
Yeah but so is brady. No other QB has done more with less.
Less? Brady has had elite talent all career. Moss, Welker are all unbelievable recievers.
Well then Montana had Rice. Who you cant dispute is the best Reciever of all time.
Fair, But you could plug anyone into the New England system and they could have success
Oh youre just out of your mind now its not even worth arguing.
I'm telling you, Brady retires then the next guy is almost as good.
I suppose we will find out soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Giants this year?
They are going to be pretty good.
Yes, but it is a tough division.
For sure, the Redskins will be good too.
You don't think the Cowboys are better?
I think that Cousins is the better quarterback.
Yeah, but Zeke might run for 2000 yards.
Sure, but that is only because Dez Bryant is old and not as good as he was.
I know what you mean, their receivers are trash.
Do you think the Eagles will compete in the division?
Perhaps, but I'm not sure how good their offense will be, it was pretty bad last year.
Yeah, they are still suffering from hiring Chip Kelly.
For sure, he should have stayed at Oregon.
I know, trading away Shady McCoy was his was of snubbing the team, the writing was on the wall with him leaving.
He was too stubborn to take advice and learn from mistakes.
Speaking of mistakes, how about Eli's interceptions?
Oh no. There is that. Maybe getting Marshall will help, he is a big bodied target.
Yes, I'm excited to see him out there.
Do they still have Cruz?
I'm not sure, I'll read up on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about football
I love that topic
Great me too
Did you see beyonce in the halftime show?
She was great
She was
And beautiful too
Exactly
She made waiting between the halves enjoyable
Exactly
I love when the nfl has a good halftime show
Me too
It makes everything better
It really does
It was a good game
So suspenseful too
It was
Superbowls are great
I look forward to them every year
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how's it going?
Good! What do you think about the Lions this year?
I think they can maintain the momentum from last year.
Yeah, I agree. They didn't lose much and only added some depth around the foundation.
I think their GM is the real deal.
He absolutely is, molded from the Pats foundation, I think he's building something behind the scenes.
I like his drafts too, seems to put in the work to find the diamonds in the rough.
I wasn't so high on his draft this year, seemed to make a lot of reaches.
I feel like those are the ones that have such a high ceiling though.
Elaborate?
The guys that other teams aren't high on, get called reaches, but maybe that's because he's seeing something special that others aren't.
Yeah, maybe...
Seriously, that WR they got in the 3rd, could be a bust, but on the surface, has all the tools you need to be a great redzone target.
Yeah, I guess I could see where you're going with that.
I feel like the best teams play safe early, and then go big in the mid/late rounds, that's really when the draft is won.
I guess only time will tell!
Got that right and hopefully it'll tell us we're going to the Super Bowl!
Haa, we can only hope!
Let's get down the field and gain, a Lion's victory!!
Go Lions!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like THE NEW YORK GIANTS.
Their nick name is BIG BLUE.
I call them G-men.
I like calling them Jints.
BIG BLUE WRECKING CREW is a funny name.
They have won 4 Super Bowls.
They have 8 league championships.
16 total in all Division championships.
32 in all playoff appearances.
The first place the played was called POLO GROUNDS.
Then they played in YANKEE STADIUM.
Then they played in the Yale Bowl.
I liked the GIANTS STADIUM.
They are the longest established team in the NORTHEASTERN U.S.
They are ranked 3rd among all NFL franchises.
They were originally NEW YORK NATIONAL LEAGUE FOOTBALL COMPANY.
They have a strong rivalry with the PHILADELPHIA EAGLES.
Their first game was with ALL NEW BRITIAN.
That was in 1925.
10,000 were in attendance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Last year the Rams moved to LA. The Chargers moved to LA starting in 2017.
A move I hate, by the way.
Do you?
Yes, I would rather see other places get NFL teams than LA get two.
They nearly could have had three, but the Raiders will be going to Las Vegas in 2020.
That move I don't mind so much. Nevada didn't have an NFL team, so it's nice to see them get one.
OK then. If you could move two or three NFL teams or create expansion teams, where would you like to see them?
For starters, I would move either the Rams or Chargers back out of LA.
Move one of them to Oakland or San Diego?
Maybe, yeah. I'd also like to see old NFL teams revived, at least in spirit.
A lot of those defunct teams were in small towns that I don't think would be able to support a modern NFL franchise, though.
I suppose so, but I'm thinking dream teams, not the reality of how they would work. So, Akron, Racine, Louisville.
Canton had a team at one point too, yeah? That would be a great option for a team.
The Canton Bulldogs were a team in the 20s, yes. It would be nice to see the town with the Hall of Fame have a team now.
Outside of old defunct teams, where would you put a modern franchise?
Oregon, maybe. New Mexico. Oklahoma.
What about expanding outside of the continental US?
I've always thought a Hawaii team would be neat, but travel would be an issue.
I'd love to see a Mexican or Canadian team. International, but close enough so travel shouldn't be a huge deal.
Those would be really fun options.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the NFC North race this year?
I mean it's probably going to be the Packers?
I was just listening to a podcast and they had Minnesota as 1?
What? What did they think made Minnesota any better than last year?
I really don't know. They got to a fast start last year at 6-0, I think, but then completely collapsed.
Yeah, and I think that collapsed part of the season is more indicative of their real team.
Definitely. What's funny though, is I think the Teddy Bridgewater injury actualyl made them better?
Hmm interesting. Not a fan of Bridgewater?
Not at all. He had an incredibly weak arm and people assumed he was mobile, which he wasn't.
Well, we may never know if he was any good now. He may never play again.
In a way that kinda annoys me, because I kept on telling my friends about how I thought he was a lousy QB and they loved him.
Yeah I guess it'll have to be a truce now.
But not even, he's been lackluster in the games he's played so far. Saying he is good is like saying Brock Osweiler is elite.
Hahahaha. Okay how about this. Who would you rather have...Alex Smith or a healthy Teddy Bridgewater.
Oh my god. Definitely Alex Smith. Not even close.
Okay, well I agree with you on Alex Smith over Bridgewater. Let's be clear that Alex Smith is not elite.
Well, yeah I guess. But he can get the job done, he is just not agressive.
Fair enough. I think it is telling that the Chiefs traded up to take Mahomes this year.
Yeah that shows they are frustrated with how conservative Smith is.
Andy Reid does have a good record and feel for QBs. It will be fun to watch the Chiefs this preseason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That last run for the TD seemed sketchy
Uh, what? Which last run?
The one from the Superbowl.
Oh White's run? yeah His knee seemed down before the ball crossed it seemed
Sketchy
Well, even if it was true that White didn't make it, what were they supposed to do? They had already shot off the confetti, fans were on the field.
Fan are not a reason to not overturn a call.
Well logistically it was impossible. Might as well just give it to them. And Falcons agreed
How do you know?
because if it was that important to them which it was, they would've asked for a challenge
But they didn't so they must have went with it?
Yep. besides, it was a difficult call, there were hardly any angles from which you could see the ball clearly as his knees went down
That sucks that we can send people to the moon, but still haven't figured out a way to view a TD unblocked.
Well, a blocked view is a blocked view regardless of the technology we have. It says nothing of our abilities. We can't physically see through people
Or can we? We do have the x ray technology
Um, yes, bombard our athlete with x rays so we can view the ball, That's the dumbest idea ever
Or is there any other technologies to see through people?
No. infrared will light up the people, but not the ball. X rays will kill peple
What about radar?
No. There is no way. A blocked view is just that. It's blocked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the G.O.A.T. (Greatest of all-time)?
Well, now the buzz is that Brady is. But I think there is some debate about this.
Who would make your short list
Definitely Brady, Montana, Jim Brown. Interestingly, It seemed like Jerry Rice was on that short list but his stock seemed to have gone down a bit.
Yeah, I remember when a lot of people thought Jerry Rice was the GOAT. Why do you think he has gone down a bit.
My theory is that with so many historically good QB's in the league right now, it's elevated the QB position even more.
And by that logic positions like RB and Wide Receiver have just gone down in importance.
Yeah, you can even see that in the NFL draft a bit. But getting back to the debate, it's really hard to be objective about Brady lately
I think the most recent Superbowl is in everyone's mind.
Yeah, it was such a remarkable comeback that for most people they think "there he is, the greatest of all-time".
Yeah, and I have a difficult time arguing with that assessment.
But I think the dust needs to settle a bit before anyone makes that proclamation.
Well, here's what I think would push him over the top: Super Bowl rings and the fact that he wasn't always surrounded by top-notch talent.
Well, it is impressive that his wide receiver core does change a lot and he is able to keep on winning. That is definitely in his favor.
What is the argument against?
I think Montana is in the discussion because his record in Super Bowls is perfect. Also, I know a lot of old-timers say Jim Brown was the most impressive player they'd every saw.
Well, I think the Jim Brown argument -- if you are going to go that route -- would not have to be based on stats but based on observing him play.
Yeah, and I think the number of people who first-hand witnessed him are obviously dwindling. Although his stats were very impressive.
Didn't have an amazing yards per carry average?
Without looking, I think so. Anyway, to me, saying that Brady is the GOAT is something you can't say without some objectivity that is granted by hindsight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man
Yo whats up my main man
What kind of offense do you like
depends
On what?
What you want to do on offense
Like
If you want to control the ball you run it.
Bang it up the middle all day long/
If you like scoring then you run the spread offense and throw it all day long
But you need a good QB for that
Yes you do
Someone who makes good decisions or you'll never go anywhere
Brady is the best at that
Yup
You don't need to run the ball with him at all
But they always catch everyone off guard when they do
Watch the patriots go to crap though when he retires
If he does
Yup. He keeps playing at that level he'll be 50 when he does
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think are some of the best NFL prizes? I think I have some idea.
Well I know they've used team trophies. This seems to be a good structure.
The one they use right now is the Vince Lombardi, right?
That's correct. He coached the Green Bay Packers to a couple of Super Bowl wins.
A brand new Vince Lombardi Trophy is given to the winning team each year, and they keep permanent control of it.
A little different from the Stanford vs. Cal college football games when they compete for temporary possession of an axe.
Well that's an interesting rivalry.
The Lombardi trophies are created by Tiffany & Co. They're said to be worth between $25,000 to $300,000.
Not bad for just a cup.
A sterling silver cup! Its quite an accomplishment.
Then there are the Super Bowl rings as well. Some players have a few.
The Super Bowl losing teams get rings also. I hear they're not generally worn.
I can understand why.
Mmm hmm, and the conference champions receive trophies too. The NFC receive the George Halas Trophy.
And I know the AFC champs get the Lamar Hunt Trophy.
Right. Plus the winning team players get a conference championship ring
Guess I wouldn't mind that, if I played ball at that level.
With the awards, I watch for the MVP, Rookie of the Year, and the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award.
Those are good ones at the individual level.
They're all good I think. Those are the ones I tend to like.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the NFL?
It's okay.
What is your favorite team?
New Orleans Saints.
Why are they your favorite.
They are the closest team to me.
Do you ever watch any of their games.
No, but I saw one on tv when i was in New Orleans.
Where were you?
Actually I was in a car dealership. The game was on while a storm was going on.
What was the atmosphere like?
There were people cheering at the tv and excited about it.
Have you ever lived in a city that had a team?
No.
I haven't either but like to watch the games.
The games are cool.
Yeah, some players steal the show.
It looks like a hard job.
There are a lot of plays to remember.
It would be fun to be a coach.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for the NFL season?
Am I ever! I'm bored with the baseball.
Still rooting for the Packers?
Yup, once a cheesehead, always a cheesehead!
Better you than me. I'm sticking with the Titans.
You just like the QB!
Of course! Marcus Mariota is cute and he is from Hawaii!!
He plays decent though.
Better than decent and he is still young!
But didn't he get hurt last season?
Yeah, toward the end of the season. He broke his leg, but he'll be ready for the season.
I hope so, for your sake.
I am not crazy about the team color though...
It's like baby blue, isn't it?
Yeah, doesn't look intimidating enough...haha!
Mariota doesn't look intimidating enough!
True, he is too cute!
Dan Marino was cute and he played well.
You see? Cute is a good thing in QB!
Ha! If you say so! Still I think Packs will beat you any day!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new football rules.
I like some of them.
Yeah some of them need to provide more safety.
I agree.
People could get hurt bad.
There are alot of concussions.
I think that if they break something they should be pulled out.
but it is there job.
I agree but it is their body too.
Yeah I never though of it that way.
Some are fathers to kids and that is dangerous.
Yeah something bad could happen.
Concussions are bad in the nfl.
I agree.
I am glad there are rules in place for that.
I am too.
It is good they check the players out.
Yeah something severe could happen.
It could cost some their lifes.
It could also cost them their careers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who's your favorite nfl team
i like the chicago bears to win this year
that's a wild guess are they that good
i just love the underdogg
yeah i think miami is good to
yeah but i dont think there better than the bears
who's going to win in the south
dallas has a awesome team
yeah i like them to
is jerry jones the owner still
yep don't think he's ever goona give that job up
yeah he's locked in.
they should do good this year
yeah they got alot of talent there
yeah i thought they would get futher than they did
they got alot of new talent comeing back
elliot is a beast
yeah they whole team play well
i agree can't wait to watch them
me to they have lots of young talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the superbowl.
I thought it was going to be a blowout and then... wow.
I know, what a heartbreaking end for atlanta.
Yeah, but give the pats credit, they never gave up.
I hate the patriots and Tom brady.
Oh they aren't that bad, but I am an AFC guy so I'll usually root for them in the superbowl.
I support the NFL all the way. Go packers!
The NFC does have some blue bloods and great rivalries don't they.
Yeah, the NFC North is just a classic division.
I've always admired the bears.
... I'm not sure we can still be friends. Haha just kidding.
What do you think about all the relocation that's happening.
I understand it, but it's still surprising that it's now 3 teams. Especially because 2 are going to the same city.
I agree.  At least the raiders picked Las vegas.  That will make for a fun road trip when they play the cheifs.
Do you go to a lot of chiefs games?
Yes, arrowhead is my favorite stadium, the fans are crazy.
I've always liked the open classic stadiums too.  The new cowboys facility is impressive though isn't it.
Definitely, it's amazing.  Too bad it doesn't help them win.
No, but dak Prescott might just be the one to change all that.
True, he was really impressive as a rookie.  I'm glad they chose him over romo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like pro football a lot. How do you suppose that enterprise is viable?
They set it up as a business in specific ways.
I'd be interested to know. Its kind of fascinating.
The NFL is set up as a business association. Its member teams finance it.
That's not so unusual then.
Up until 2015 the NFL operated as an unincorporated nonprofit.
What changed?
The NFL drew criticism from the public, largely about taxes.
Yeah I heard they still owe millions of dollars in backtaxes.
It was a big controversy. Some people looked at the business end of the NFL unfavorably.
So now they pay taxes.
And the executive officers are now paid undisclosed salaries.
Its a tradeoff I suppose.
There are three officers, plus coaches, players, and employees.
The commissioner is the one who is elected into office.
The big guy, so to speak.
He's the one who hires the other two officers.
The current commissioner is...who?
I think its still Roger Goodell.
For some reason I'm reminded of the Olympics right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest quarterback ever?
I think right now it's Tom Brady.
Do you think he's better than Joe Montana?
Brady has won more Super Bowls than Montana.
How many Super Bowls did Montana win?
Joe Montana won 4 Super Bowls.
How many has Brady won?
Tom has won 5.
What about Terry Bradshaw?
Terry Bradshaw won 4 Super Bowls.
I guess if we are only going by Super Bowls Tom Brady is the best.
Super Bowls seem to be the biggest factor.
I would still rather have Joe Montana.
Hey, I think Joe is great but you asked who is the greatest of all time.
I think Joe is better than Brady.
Why is that?
Joe just seemed to never lose his cool.
Well he was called 'Joe Cool'.
I do see your point with Brady winning 1 more Super Bowl.
Plus, Tom is still playing it could be more than 1 before he retires.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the NFL draft closely?
Fairly. I tend to skim it over for the most part.
Same here. Who do you think had the best draft this year?
I'm gonna have to go with the 49ers or the Browns.
They both did very well with what they had available.
The Browns played it especially well I felt.
Yeah, they didn't spend too much and they got Garret.
They also ended up grabbing that Notre Dame quarterback.
Yeah, DeShone Kizer is his name.
I liked that they didn't overspend and they're in a great position for next year.
That's true. They have something like 5 picks in the first two rounds next year.
That's a very nice spot to be in.
More than enough for them to get a first round quarterback and anything else they need next year.
True. The 49ers played that draft well too.
Yeah, they traded their 2nd round pick to the Bears and still got the guy they wanted.
That allowed them to make a couple more third and fourth round picks, also.
They got Solomon Thomas, right?
Yes they did. That was a highly sought after pick.
They also ended up with Reuben Foster.
That's crazy. I can't believe they ended up with both of those players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One thing I find very entertaining about Super Bowl are the commercials.
The really come up with some innovative commercials.
Do you know who is credited with the first famous Super Bowl commercial?
Yes. It's Joe Namath.
I don't know who he is.
He was a quarterback mainly known for the New York Jets, although he ended his career playing for the Los Angeles Rams.
What was the commercial for?
It was for Noxema Cream.
What's that?
It's a shaving cream.
Well, I have never seen that commercial, but I do have a favorite Super Bowl commercial.
What's that?
It was a commercial with frogs croaking out Budweiser.
I think I remember seeing that.
Another one I liked was a Pepsi commercial with Brittany Spears.
Oh that was really like a music video.
It was and I liked it a lot.
A lot of celebrities have contributed to Super Bowl commercials.
Just look at the Honda commercial from the lst Super Bowl.
I know. I wish I could have been there to watch them record it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for football to start again?
Yeah I'm already watching the Packer's pre season.
How are they looking?
Good so far. Hopefully they keep it up. I would like to win the work pool this year.
Your co workers follow football too?
Yeah we have decorations up and everything once it starts and a bulletin board that shows the rankings of the different teams.
What all teams do you guys follow?
Packers, Lions, Vikings and for some reason there are a few that like the Dolphins.
Wow that sounds fun.
Yeah who ever's team wins get to have a specail work lunch provided by the losers.
So you think your Packers will take the title this year?
Yeah definitely we deserve it with all our hard work.
I like Aaron Rodgers but you know my team is the Lions so I have to say that Matthew Stafford is better.
Oh yeah right. He wishes.
I'm serious and I think my team has better team dynamics.
Well with see how it goes this seasons. Packers will wipe the floor with the Lions
We have a good line up this years and I think we will surprise you.
Ha. Not a chance. We win against the lions constantly.
We get our hits in.
Half of the state of Michigan roots for the Packers instead of the Lions what does that tell you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think it the top running back in the league?
I'm not sure running back aren't what they used to be.
Yes, it seems the league is turning more aerial.
The forward pass is getting more and more important.
Teams don't even put as much weight into the position.
You think Adrian Pederson?
He is good but not sure as he is getting older.
How about Lesean McCoy?
McCoy is shifty but not an all around back.
How about the new kid Ezekial Elliot?
He looked good last year but still a lot to prove.
Le'Veon Bell had a good year last year.
He is definitely one of the better backs in the league.
How about DeMarco Murray?
After going to Tennessee he had a resurgence.
He is a good back when his running style is used right.
David Johnson from Arizona is good too.
He would be on my list of good backs.
Jordon Howard from the Chicago Bears is another upcoming rookie from last year.
He will be one to watch in the upcoming season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does the Jets schedule look like?
Pretty tough, I think, and their division is difficult.
Do they have any prime time games this season?
Yes, every team must have one.      They play Buffalo in November on a Thursday
Will the Jets running game hold up?
It absolutely must, since the passing game is in such doubt.
Who will be the leaders carrying the ball?
First is Matt Forte at running back.
How did he do last season.
A touch over 800 yards, so not great.
OK, who else?
They also have Bilal Powell. with 700 yards last season.
Less than 2000 yards between the top two running backs is tough.
Agreed, definitely not Pro Bowl numbers
What about the staff?
Well, the Jets have a new offensive coordinator.
Will that help?
John Morton is going to want to increase the tempo.
With no quarterback and a limited running game, can that work?
The magic eight ball would definitely be evasive about the status!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the NFC South is the best division in Football?
Oh for sure! Its just stacked.
I agree but I am not sold on Atlanta
After the Super Bowl they sure looked vulnerable.
I think they were all year, but just got lucky at the right times.
Thats probably true. They had some big holes
I am actually more impressed with Tampa.
I think they have done some good moves.
And spent money....but not stupid money.
No, I agree. They signed people who will help and the drafted.
Its a good forumla and hopefully it works again
It would be nice
What are your thoughts about Saints?
I dont know what to make of them
I think there will be flashes here and there but they are a few years away still.
I think so too. They had a decent draft though.
The draft more and more is the key for teams.
I know...and then they don't have to overpay
Well unless you have a QB.
Well of course
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Pro Bowl?
I think it's a total waste of time
I agree, I hate that game
It's just a way for the NFL to make more money
Yeah and it's dangerous for the players
If they get hurt in the pro bowl then they definitely will regret playing
That just takes money out of their pocket
Yeah it's a stupid concept
I do like the idea of having an all star team though
Yeah and most other sports teams have it
Also, if a player goes to the pro bowl, it increases their worth when it comes to signing contracts
That's true, many times teams decide how good someone is by how many pro bowls they've been to
So I can see it both ways
I still think it's heavily skewed towards the league
Without a doubt, the league always gets their money!
I usually do watch the game though because its one of the last of the year
Yeah it always signals an end to the season
It's kind of a farewell game
I suppose it's not all that bad then, I will give it another chance
I think I will too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi
We gotta get this party going
We are still getting stuff ready
Why
Uh
What?
I do not got anything bought
You are late
I know
We gotta keep the super bowl party going
Well
Well what
It will be ready
Okay
I'm sorry
It's alright just the Super Bowl of the century
It is?
Uh yeah
Who you rooting for?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the worst "dagger to the heart" that you have experienced watching football?
Watching Ricardo Lockett get hit made me feel sick. I felt like I just watched someone get paralyzed. I'm glad he's alright.
Why or why not does your team  need a new stadium?
RCA stadium? It'll never change. It'll probably outlast the NFL.
If someone you secretly disliked was thinking about becoming a fan of your team, how would you describe your team to them so that they didn't want to root for them?
If I disliked someone I'd want them to root for my team so they could suffer too.
Who would you rather have on your team going forward, Julio Jones or OBJ?
I'd take Julio because that means Atlanta wouldn't have him anymore
What unpopular prediction about the 2016 season did you get correct?
I had the Lions getting the 6 seed believe it or not. Everyone thought without Megatron they'd be 5-11.
Stafford proved last season that he could play well when Johnson was injured
It's the history of the team. The Lions haven't been a consistent team since the 50's so when the generational talent leaves the team people expect them to regress.
Who is the least athletic player to play well at a skill position?
I mean Marques Colston never wowed anyone with his athletic ability but still became the Saints all-time leading WR in every category.
I feel like Peyton Manning wasn't really athletic, he just had a cannon and was accurate
Along that same note, there's a reason Brady wasn't chosen til the 6th round.
What players do you believe had the best Mechanics,Technique, Football IQ?
Prime Revis had the best combination of iq, technique, athleticism and ability to hold with getting penalized I've seen from a corner.
If You can change one draft pick for your team in the past 10 years, who is it?
Derek Carr instead of Kyle Fuller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Superbowl XV.
Who played in that one?
Oakland Raiders versus the Philadelphia Eagles.
Where was it played?
The Superdome.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Ron Jaworski for the Eagles and Jim Plunkett for the Raiders.
Didn't Plunkett play for the Patriots?
Five seasons.
Who scored first?
The Raiders scored two unanswered touchdowns in the first.
What was the halftime score?
14-3, Oakland.
Who played at halftime?
Up with People doing a Mardi Gras tribute.
What happened in the third quarter?
Ten unanswered points by Oakland.
And in the fourth?
A touchdown for Philly and a field goal for the Raiders.
I'm an old AFL fan myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seems like there's a pretty good group of safeties in the league right now.
Some real good players for sure.
Maybe not a Lonnie Rott, but some good ones.
Well, the position has changed so much.  Can't hit guys like you used to.
That's probably why nobody wants a safety in the box anymore.
It helps to have good run skills, but you need to force turnovers.
That's why I would probably take Eric Berry.
Great choice and a total inspiration.
Yeah, the way he came back cancer is simply incredible.
And came back better!
He's a true ballhawk for sure.  Wish he was on my team.
What do you think about Landon Collins?
Great pick by the Giants.  Just seems to be around the ball.
I remember him falling in the draft a bit too.
He's just skilled in all facets of the game with tons of room to grown.
I'd also be remiss to not include Earl Thomas.
Didn't he get injured though?
Yeah, he did, but he completes that secondary.
Seattle really suffered without him.
Yep, they need him back healthy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best defensive lineman in the NFL?
Playing or past?
Either.
In the past I really liked watching Warren Sapp.  I don't know that he was the best though.
Okay.  So who do you think is current best?
I think Khalil Mack plays well.
Mack is a great player.
I think he really raises the quality of his team.
Who does he play for again.
The Oakland Raiders.
That is right.
Speaking of the Raiders what do you think of Carr?
The quarterback?
Yes.
I don't know much about him.
I didn't watch him close last year but it seemed like he had a lot of highlights.
I guess he did since I know the name.
I will have to pay more attention to him this year.
I think he must be fun to watch.
I sure hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are several teams that have never played in the SUPER BOWL.
I know the Jacksonville Jaguars have not.
Neither have the Houston Texans.
They used to be called the Oilers.
Detroit Lions have not either.
Neither have the Cleveland Browns.
3 teams have been to the SUPER BOWL only one time.
The Arizona Cardinals went once.
So have the Tennessee Titans.
LA Chargers went once.
New England Patriots have had the most appearances.
And the Steelers have won the most.
SUPER BOWL SUNDAY is the second largest day for food consumption.
It probably tops for Beer consumption also.
It is usually the most watched TV show every year.
7 of the SUPER BOWLS are the most watched TV shows ever.
2015 was the most watched year.
114.4 viewers watched it.
SUPER BOWL is also the most watched event in the world.
It is called the BIG GAME.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah sure who doesn't?
Well, my wife for one.
Oh, bummer.
She doesn't like many sports.
I guess that is pretty common.
Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Jaguars.
Oh interesting.  You from that area?
Yeah, why do you ask?
It's just they're not very good, so you must be from around there.
Oh.  Yeah I see what you mean.
I like the Chiefs.
Cool, you from around there.
Yeah.
I don't know much about the chiefs.
That's okay I don't know much about the Jags.
Gotcha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Currently, do you have a favorite NFL team?
Of course I do. It's the Denver Broncos.
They are a great team. I bet you were very happy last year when they took it?
Oh absolutely. I actually had to work the next morning at six in the morning but made sure to stay up until the end of the game.
I think it is safe to say that they redeemed themselves after 2014?
Oh please do not get me started on that game. That was truly difficult to watch.
It was a rough one. I believe it went down as the most one-sided SuperBowl game of all time.
I can surly believe that. I had a friend who was betting a little bit with co-workers and he lost money very quickly!
I remember thinking of you when that game was going on. Thinking how you must've tossed your TV across the room!
It came close. I was at a friends house for that game, and he is not a Denver fan, but even he felt it was very hard to get through.
Are you family Denver fans, also?
Actually, no. Just my step father, who lived in CO for a chunk of his life.
Do you remember what his thoughts were on that game?
If memory serves, he did not even watch the whole thing.
Did he even make it to half time?
I believe he said that was when he turned it off.
Safe to say, not due to a lack luster half time show?
Not at all! He was very upset with his teams performance and could not take anymore.
Needless to say, the Broncos made it up for it last year.
And I was truly happy to see it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, are you going to watch any NFL games this season?
Yeah, I'll probably tune into a few.
Oh, cool man. What's your favorite team?
I like the Falcons.
Oh yeah? Are you from the Atlanta area?
Yeah I grew up there, but now I live in Detroit.
Oh, so do you like the Lions too? They had a decent season last year.
Yeah I root for them too, I like Matt Stafford.
Yeah he's a pretty good quarterback. Who are some of your other favorite players?
I like Matt Ryan, and Julio Jones. What about you?
Yeah I like those guys too. But my favorite player is probably Marshawn Lynch.
Beast Mode. Yeah you must be excited that he came out of retirement to play this season.
Oh for sure man. It will be weird seeing him playing for the Raiders though.
Yeah, that's his hometown though right? Oakland?
Yeah I think that's why he came out of retirement, to play for his home team.
Oh, thats cool, we will see how the Raiders do this year.
I don't know if they will do that well. They are in a tough division.
Yeah the Chiefs, and Broncos and who else are in that division?
The Chargers.
Oh yeah that's right. They didn't do too well last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about last year's Super Bowl?
Amazing game, one of the most exciting second halves I've seen in a Super Bowl!
Amazing unless you are a Falcons fan, then it was a nightmare.
That's true. I'm not a fan of either team though so I just enjoy a good,competitive game.
Who do you think will get to the Super Bowl this year?
It's way too early to make a prediction like that. People who try before the season even starts are always wrong.
Okay who do you want to get to the Super Bowl rather than who you think actually will?
I'm hoping the Green Bay Packers will get there.
Aaron Rodgers is obviously going to be good but how is their defense going to be?
That's the big question, I think it's adequate. There's some question about how well they can stop the good team in the league.
Who is your favorite Packers defensive player?
I think linebacker, Clay Matthews is really good. I like watching him play.
Most people would say Julius Peppers as their favorite Packers defensive player.
He's great too, I just really like watching Clay Matthews. I respect his skills at the position he plays.
Are you going to go to any Packers games this year?
I'd love to go to a game at Lambeau Field, it's an amazing game day atmosphere but I probably won't be able to afford a ticket this year.
How many games have you been to in Green Bay?
In my lifetime I've probably been to about 10 games.
I always try to get to at least one game per year for my team.
Watching an NFL game in person is so much better than watching it on television.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL football?
Yes, from time to time I do.
What is your favorite team?
I like the Denver Broncos.
Is Peyton Manning still there?
No, he retired a few years ago.
He won that before he went, though, right?
Yes, he won one after he lost against the Seahawks.
Is he in the Hall of Fame yet?
No, you have to wait a certain amount of time.
Is that so? How long?
I don't know, but at least a few years.
I just heard Cortez Kennedy died, from the Seahawks.
Yes, he was in the Hall of Fame.
He was a defensive end, I think. His team was never too to good though.
At least he was in the Hall of Fame.
Yes, that's good I guess.
He's not alive anymore.
No, he's not.
Great players in the NFL make the Hall of Fame. That's all I have to say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Bears have the worst font office in the NFL?
Oh absolutely. Just take a look at their last draft and how they are getting ridiculed for it.
On ESPN they said that the Bears were "fleeced" by San Francisco GM John Lynch.
Lynch came out looking like a hero after his draft day trade with the Bears.
He sure did. Rumor has it that he got whomhe wanted anyways at the end of the first day.
Meanwhile the Bears pay up for Trubisky who probably won't even play for a couple years.
I know! The bears have so many holes at several positions.
Tons of holes and little experience across the board.
The draft is supposed to be used to build a roster up, not to gamble on a high risk quarterback.
I wouldn't call Trubisky high risk, but the bears don't have the right system to support his development.
Well, drafting a division II tight end in the second round didn't help either.
That's my point exactly. The Bears front office has no idea how to build a roster.
Well if these high risk drafts don't pan out, then I would expect Gates to be fired as Bears GM after this season.
I agree. I think he set the Bears organization backwards at least three years with this disaster of a draft.
I would have preferred they traded down and stockpiled draft picks.
Me too, you build a team through defense and bodies on both lines.
Tell that to the Bears!
I wish I could. I think they are killing this team.
Well at least one good thing will come from this terrible season the Bears will have.
Oh don't you dare say that a Bears front office gets another high draft pick! Haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey man
What is up
Nothing much
Cool
Yeah you want to come over
Sure thing
We can listen to the game
What game
The football
Sure i love foot bal
Coolio
What teams are playing
The Denver Broncos
Who are they playing against
They are going against the steelers
Well thats gonna be a blow out
For sure
The steelers will knock them down
No joke
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, do you think Colin Kapernick is done with football?
Well, he's a free agent and no team has picked him up so far.
I think with a month left it would be hard to just "show up and play"
True.
Plus i think he does not want to play anymore.
You think?
Yeah, he's off to "go find himself"
It too bad, he had talent, i can see him getting forgotten real quick.
HA! That's true.
It's happened before.
It's funny i was thinking about that 49'ers/Rams game where he ran the 2 pt conversion in.
Oh yeah, that was great.
He kept looking like he was gonna pass it and just leaped it in.
Yes and the 49'ers interception right after that play won the game.
Yeah, i just can't see why kapernick would walk away from all of that.
Well, like i said he wants to go find himself.
Hopefully if he returns it will be like Dave Chappell... just slide back in.
I don't think it will be that easy for him.
One can always hope.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the upcoming football season?
Yeah, I can't wait to see what my Seahawks do this year.  How about You?
Absolutely.  I was crushed last year when the Patriots did their comeback.  I'm really hoping that they lose this year.
Yeah, it is frustrating how much they've been dominating these past years.
Absolutely.  So are you going to be attending any games this year?
Yeah, I live in Arizona, so I'll probably watch them when the play the Cardinals.  How about you?
I might catch a Lions game or so, but they haven't been doing so hot these past years, so kinda depressing.
Yeah, I hear you, I went through nearly 30 years of the Seahawks sucking.
That they did.
It was especially humiliating because I worked for many years on a fishing boat named after the Seahawks, so I'd constantly get razzed.
Heh, well I'll keep that in mind if the Lions keep up their current streak.
So did you have a Superbowl party or go to one last season?
Yeah, there was a nice party at my local pub, me and a bunch of buddies just hung out there.
Nice.  We did the whole big screen TV, home party thing.  Was a lot of fun, put clean up was a pain.
Yeah absolutely.
So any other teams you rooting for or are you strictly a Lions fan?
I'm for the Lions and 'anyone who can beat the Patriots'.
My dad feels the same way, but he is for 'the Seahawks and anyon who can beat the Cowboys'.
Why does he hate the Cowboys?
I'm not sure I think they were crushing the Seahawks back in the day, and so he just built up this animosity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the dolphins winning ten games was a fluke?
What do you mean.
Well,outside of New England,the east is weak.
True,they play every one twice in their division.
That's a great point.
I guess their schedule is a lot tougher this year outside of their division.
Yea,they get the falcons too,besides two with the patriots.
That's going to be tough.
Could go 0-3.
That's very possible.
They play the saints and raiders too.
I think both of them will be improved.
The raiders were very good until the injuries.
Losing Carr was a killer.
Anyone who loses their starting qb is in trouble usually.
They also play the chiefs.
The chiefs will be a tough one too.
Andy Reid does a good job.
He's a good overall head coach.
Yes he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
looks like brady and the pat are still the best
no doubt about it
the man never ages he still plays like he's 25
and along with belichick it's an unbeatable combination
imagine if he had speed and could run
he would be even more awesome but he can't run
i know his best asset is his brain and how he just knows the game
for sure, what do you think about dallas this year
they have a great qb and rb they should be right up there
agreed, they didn't really have playoff experience last year but should go further this year
i can't wait until football season
same here I'll soon be putting my fantasy team together
yes me too, the only problem is when you have to cheer on players when they play the pats
that's why i try not to use players when they play us but it's kinda difficult
training camp starts in a few weeks I think I'll go watch a few
sounds good maybe I'll join you
great we can grab some lunch and a beer after watching brady warm up
sounds like a plan .....GO PATS lol
yes GO PATS  but no problem getting to the superbowl again this year
i couldn't agree more we are spoiled fans but that's fine with me
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch nfl?
Yes love watching it
Great me too
I love the dallas cowboys
Me too
They are a great team
Do you watch preseason
Yes, always
Im excited for their first game
Me too
August 3rd
Who are they playing again?
The cardinals
That should be a good gsme
Yes it will
What time is it at
7pm
Awesome
Less than a month away
Im excited
XXXXXXXXXXX
You looking forward to the NFL season this year?
No, not really actually?
Really, you? You used to be such an avid fan and you used to go with your dad to see every single home game?
Well, yeah, I guess I've soured a bit on the money aspect of the game. I was a pretty big St. Louis Rams fan as you know, and I just think that city got the shaft.
Yeah, I can understand that you're upset. I suppose if you have an allegiance to a city that no longer has a team you might feel cheated.
Yeah, I sure do. I've analyzed what went down with the decision to move the NFL from St. Louis to L.A. and from every angle I think the city got screwed.
Don't you think San Diego and Oakland feel the same way?
They may feel the same way, but the fact remains, particularly in the case of Oakland, the city offered no public money. St. Louis did ... big time.
Yeah, I forgot about that point. But I guess some people feel that going back to L.A. is sort of karma to St. Louis.
You have to draw the line somewhere. The Rams used to be somewhere else before L.A. and St. Louis - why not move that team back there?
Yeah, but haven't the last superbowls been exciting?
Sure, but sometimes you have to put principal ahead of having fun.
Yup. I know a lot of people agree with you - probably in St. Louis, San Diego and Oakland.
There are particularly two incidents from the whole St. Louis to L.A. move that still bother me.
Yeah, like what?
Well, first is the owners vote. Originally, there weren't enough owners voting to move the group. Then, when they took a "blind" vote where owners didn't have accountability to their vote, they voted to move the team.
In other words, if the owners didn't have to be wedded publicly to their vote, then they voted for the money.
Precisely. Then, St. Louis also met every guideline presented by the NFL. According to Dave Peacock, the guy spearheading the Rams in St. Louis movement, the NFL were very, um, shady in their dealings.
Well, look, from the perspective outside St. Louis, the headline was "Rams back to L.A." not "St. Louis gets screwed".
Very true. All of this is why I've cooled on the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for another Giants Superbowl win?
Of course not!
Why?
I cannot stand Eli Manning to save my life.
Oh no, why? He's a good guy.
He's a jerk disguised as a good guy.
No way. How so?
Remember when he was drafted?
A bit, what happened?
Do you remember who drafted him?
The Giants.
WRONG. The Browns.
Huh. I didn't know that.
So here's why I hate him.
Okay.
He flat-out refused to play for them. He literally said he would not play a single snap.
Why not?
He said he'd only play for the Giants.
You hate him for that?
Yes. He had the audacity to come out of college and demand which team he plays for, and threw a fit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey just so you know, I'm not coming to the Jets Giants preseason game this year.
What, why not?
The Jets have no quaterback this year.
So, the Giants have no O line again.
Yeah, I guess thats true, but still I don't think Petty is gonna get us any wins.
Don't let that keep you from a day of tailgaiting.
But I hate to watch my boys loose another season.
We go despite knowing our teams wont do well.
At least you guys had 11 wins and got to the wild card game.
Yeah and we lost that to Green Bay, getting to the wild card game was a gift.
We had 5 wins last season.
I know, not the best record. Still, you gonna miss a day of tailgating.
I just can't cheer a loosing team.
Think of the burgers and cold beer.
They were really tasty.
And we had amazing seats, right over the tunnel.
I know, I still have the pictures from last year.
The one you got of Eli was great.
Alright, I'll come this year, at least they might win one preseason game.
Maybe they'll have a quaterback by then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the buffalo bills
They are a pretty good team
They are
I enjoyed watching them last year
Same here
Their preseason starts august 10
It is coming up soon
Yes it is
Im so excited
Me too
Football is fun to watch
It is
When's their first regular season game?
September 10
Against who?
The Jets
Oh okay
Should be be interesting game
I agree
Good talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
I bet you are excited about watching the new NFL season starting in Sept.
Yea, I can't wait. I hope my team does better this year.
What's your favorite team?
The New York Giants.
They didn't do so good last season?
No, they didn't make the playoffs.
I thought they had good wide receivers including Odell Beckham.
Yea, he is great but they need a better running back.
Did they pick up one in the off season?
No,not really. I was hoping for that.
Eli Manning is quarterback for the Giants. Right?
Yea, but he is coming off a bad season.
Do you think they might need a new quarterback?
They did pick up a young quarterback.
Is he going to replace Eli?
No, not enough experience for that yet.
So do you think Eli still has it?
He is undefeated against the Patriots and Brady in the super bowl.
Well, hopefully the New York Giants will do better this season.
Yes, hopefully they will win the season!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite NFL player?
You mean of all time? Probably Joe Montana from the 49ers
Yeah he's a legend all around. What about current players?
Overall, I think my favorite is probably Aaron Rodgers
Do you think Rodgers is better than Tom Brady?
Well the Patriots have more of a dynasty than the Packers do, at least recently, but I think Rodgers is the superior player overall
And yet Brady will probably go down as the greatest quarterback--if not overall player--of all time
I can't really argue against that when the numbers back it up
The numbers are one thing, but who would you want to lead your team when your best players are hurt or have retired?
I heard that the Patriots are statistically worse when Rob Gronkowski isn't playing
Yes, and same with Brady, so you know the two of them have an enormous impact
Without Aaron Rodgers, the Packers would probably be average at best
Now there's a sign of a really good player, even if the team doesn't have as many wins as the Patriots do
So who is your favorite current player?
It's so hard to choose, but I like defense so I think I'd say J. J. Watt
Oh yeah he's really good, and people thought he was a bad pick when he got drafted
Hindsight is 20/20, after all. Just look at what happened with RGIII
Yeah but he got hurt a lot and the Redskins totally mismanaged his career, he was really talented and had a lot of potential
Do you think he'll bounce back again?
Not with the Browns, he won't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey buddy, want in our Fantasy League this year?
Of course, why wouldn't I?
Figured i'd ask haha. Who do you think's going to take it this year?
I'd like it to be the Eagles, but it'll probably be the patriots again.
Yeah, I don't know how they keep they're team so stacked.
Right?  They picked up Brandin Cooks man, they don't need that skill.
They're going to be unstoppable, I'm excited to see how him and Brady click together.
They finally got another decent corner too.
Really who?
Stephen Gilmore.
Jeez man, they're stacked again this year.
I really don't know who's going to be on their level.
Well Dallas made some good pickups this year.
I sure hope they don't have a decent team this year, but as long as the Eagles beat them I'll be fine.
You really are a huge Eagles fan.
Win or lose brother.
Good on you, my team's not too much better so I can't say much.
Who's your team again?
The dolphins.
Yeah, they're not much better haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a blackout?
Excuse me?
Your NFL team is still he Panther's right?
Yes they sure are.
Well sometimes they say they are having a blackout.
Oh, my bad.
Oh now you know what I mean.
Yes it's when they wear the black Jerseys to away games.
Ah, it make since now.
We look really good when we have a black out.
So what's that dab thing ya'll got going around.
Oh you know the dance.
Everybody I see is doing that crazy move.
That's how we dab on them.
It's becoming popular all over.
Yes I love seeing the little kids do it on Facebook.
The Panthers really know how to put on a show.
We in the Carolina's baby. That's our southern charm.
I know that's right.
Win or lose I'm a Panther's fan til I die!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like more? The beginning of the NFL season, or the end.
I love the beginning of the season.
Why? The end of the season is just one big party.
Yeah, but the beginning of the season holds so much possibility.
Possibility for what?
Possibility for everything and everyone.
I'm going to need some examples.
In the beginning of the season, you don't know if there is going to be a Cnderella team who is just magically good.
I guess you have a point..
You also don't know which rookies are going to have amazing seasons.
Yeah, I guess the speculation around that is pretty fun.
In the beginning of the season you get to have a NFL fantasy draft too, and that comes with it's own possibilities.
I don't really like fantasy football, I just like watching the football games on tv,
Well, regardless, for other people that's still one of the things.
Okay, yeah I guess. But the end of the season is so fun.
Not for everyone.
What do you mean?
It's not fun if your team doesn't make the playoffs.
I didn't think about that.
I guess it's okay to like either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the next big QB in the league?
Maybe Carson Wentz?
What makes you think its him?
He has in the intangibles and looks like a leader.
How about Dak Prescott?
He could be the next one as well though its tough because he has the best line and RB in the league.
Guys like Brady, Roethlisberger, and Brees will be gone soon
Yeah its a definite changing of the guard in the NFL
So now we have to look at who will take over for the league
I think you could include Andrew Luck in that list.
Yeah hes been hurt or mired on a bad team lately
But he still has the requisite skills to be good
Yeah I agree with that point
So we named 3 is there anyone else
Mariota in Tennessee could be like that.
Yeah its tough with him
Whys that?
He has a skillset that I dont know can succeed over time
Almost every QB does though
I dont know Wentz is a traditional QB in my eyes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your team?
Miami Dolphins, unfortunately
Why do you say that?
Ryan Tannehill. Tired of waiting for him
He doesn't have anybody to throw to. Landry only had 4 tds last year
But didn't they beat Pittsburgh last year?
Yeah, but the Steeler mopped them in the playoffs
Yeah, I remember that. It was awful
Yup I turned it off in the first quarter
It shuold have been worse.
It would have if Pittsburgh hadn't took it's foot off the gas
Yeah...let's not talk about that game anymore
They won ten games last year...
That's about three games more than they should have won last year
Maybe, but they did win..
Defense got some help
What do you mean?
Harris and McMillan  as linebacker
The definitely need some help there
They need help everywhere
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the 49ers fire Chip Kelly last year?
Yes, thank goodness for us fans.
He may have been a good college coach, but he was a terrible pro coach.
He just had one gimmick that got figured out.
It worked for a little while with teams being caught off guard.
But then coaches started to learn how to counter it.
Once that happened everyone just copied the formula.
Chip wasn't that creative.
No, he thought the system trumped everything.
He only ran a handful of plays.
In some of his games when he coached the Eagles it got to the point opposing defenses were calling out plays.
These guys knew the play before it happened?
Yes.  That's how predictable he got.
Unbelievable yet he still insisted on doing the same thing.
And, he didn't know how to use his players.
He kept trying to fit players into his system not the other way around according to their talents.
Not to mention his style killed his own defense.
These guys were on the field all game getting worn down.
Especially if the offense sputtered it was a rapid three and out.
And then even if they did score if was only a short rest for the defense.  No time of possession.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Worst team in the NFL this year. What are your thoughts?
How could I not say the Cleveland Browns?
How could you not. I agree.
They went one and fifteen last year and were lucky to win that one game.
Who did they beat last year. I can't remember.
The Chargers. I believe it was the last game of the season as well.
Was it. Crazy they won the last game of the season.
They're on a winning streak. Watch out.
Ha ha. Yeah, they are bound to reel off seventeen in a row now and go 16 and 0 this year.
After all of the crazy things that have happened in 2016 and 2017, that would be the biggest shock of all time.
For sure. What other teams do you see as being horribly atrocious?
The teams that come to mind are the Jets, Chargers, and the Bears.
Bears might be a little bit better. Didn't they just get a new quarterback.
Not particularly any good ones. Glennon, I believe. They lost Cutler.
Oh year, Cutler is gone. That's an upgrade just there.
Ha ha. Pick six Cutler. He retired, right?
I believe so.
The bears did draft that Trubisky guy from North Carolina.
That guy is either the next Ben Roethlisberger or the next bust.
He's a bear. So, I'm going with a bust.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite football team?
My favorite is the Seahawks?
How did you choose them, when you live on the East coast?
I liked their colors when I was little.
Funny, I used to choose teams the same way.
Did you?
Yeah, I liked the Vikings purple and yellow outfits and went with them.
Of course, you had to go with the local team too right?
Sometimes, but once we got cable I was able to see more Vikings games.
Yeah, having cable helps a lot in watching my favorites.
Did you play football as a kid?
No, but my brother did.
Was he any good?
He was fast, but small.
You have to be big and muscular to get ahead in football.
Usually, but some guys are smaller.
The running backs have to have speed.
They can be smaller, but it must be scary being tackled by someone 400 pounds.
It can be intimidating, but the players work hard to get their place on the team.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever watch the Dallas Cowboys games?
Yeah but I'm not sure if I will now that Romo retired.
He was a good Quarterback.
It is a shame he never won a Superbowl.
Yeah that is too bad.
He had a long career though and some players don't always get that.
Exactly he was with Dallas for 14 seasons.
Yeah he must be proud of what he accomplished.
Do you think Rayne Prescott can replace Romo?
He did a great job last season.
How were his stats?
He got 23 touchdowns with only 4 interceptions.
That is an incredible season!
If he can keep that up next season; they will have a good chance of going far in the playoffs.
I am sure they will at least make the playoffs.
They have a good chance of making it.
If they don't make it that will be a shame.
Well no reason to think about it now.
Yeah we have a few months until football starts back up.
Let's enjoy the rest of this summer!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up with the Raiders new colors?
The owner is batshit crazy!
that he is!
I heard he want to add Gold to the black and sliver!
I really starting to hate the NFL owners!
me to! theyre so greedy
yup
After the San Diego Chargers left I think this will be my last season as a fan
I hear yah
Im not sure whats going on with the Chargers
I wonder if they are sharing the locker with the Rams?
All I know is Spanos is a ahole!
All he wants to do is sell the team for more money
Its like the owner from Oakland, he looks like Moe from the 3 stogges!
I think all rich NFL owners handle large amount of cash and the ink has seaped into their blood stream
GOLD is he crazy! How many years the Raiders have been Black and Silver?
for ever
yup
I really hope he doesn't change anything!
ONLY TIME WILL TELL!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi!
Hi....
How's it going?
Good.
Uhhh, so what are you doing right now?
Oh, just lookin' at MetLife Stadium!
Oh really.
Yeah, heard they're gonna make some renovations to it!
Oh yeah, from whom?
From the Director of NFL himself.
How so?
They say, that they're improving it for some hunk-a-junk bout the Super Bowl, but I don't believe that.
Then why do you think they're really changing MetLife for?
Hmmm, not sure.
What's on your mind?
Most likely, the fact that they're just renovating it for the Jets!
Huh, makes sense.
I overheard some complaints coming from some of the players themselves.
About what?
I'll tell you more, once we get out of this joint.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I actually like Denver Broncos for winning this year.
Why do you think they could win versus the Patriots?
They have a well balanced team and a young quarterback.
I actually think the New Orleans Saints may be tough again this year. Drew Brees is still great.
Yes, you have a point but don't forget about the Atlanta Falcons. The Patriots stole the Superbowl from them in the last few minutes of the game.
You are right. They will be really hungry for a Superbowl trophy.  I bet they are still upset about the loss in the game.
For the Patriots to score 19 points in the fourth quarter to win had to kill the Falcon's enthusiasm.
I think that has to be the upset of the last 10 years! Everyone is still talking about it.
I think the NFL draft this year will make a huge difference for a number of teams. My favorite was Christian McCaffrey from Stanford.
Yes he's fast as a running back but I don't know if it will help the Carolina Panthers that much since he is so small.
My favorite was Addree' Jackson from USC although I will admit I'm partial to USC. Juju is so fast and explosive as a return man and a corner back.
He is fun to watch. He has the speed without a doubt. However, he doesn't have the obvious size or strength. I will admit there are not many athletes with his talent.
We will just have to watch him play with Tennessee Titans and see how he does.
This conversation is getting me excited for Pre-Season games. I can't wait for August to get here.
As a Los Angeles resident, I am crossing my fingers that the Rams will have a better year.
They did not do very well last year. The new kid from UCLA did not really perform very well.
Yes, Jared Goff. He did have a disappointing first year. Unfortunately, he was really only allowed to play starting mid-season.
OK. I'll keep my opinions regarding him open until he can get a fair chance this upcoming season.
The big excitement for this area is that the San Diego Chargers are moving to Los Angeles for the 2017-2018 season.
Wow. Two NFL teams will be located in Los Angeles. The great thing is that there are so many football fans that they will be able to support both of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite team in the AFC North
has got to be the Pittsburgh Steelers
that is unfortunate
why do you say that?
because i am a Cleveland Browns fan
I think it might be more unfortunate to be a browns fan
ok you got me there
no kidding, the browns had a terrible 2016 season, did they even win a game
they did win ONE game
ha! who did they beat?
they beat the Chargers
now I feel bad for the chargers
at least  the browns got some good draft picks because of it
no kidding. they got the number 1 pick overall, three first-round picks and five in the first three rounds
yep. those were some valuable picks
who did the number one pick end up being
Myles Garrett from Texas A&M
what position?
He plays defensive end
that was a good spot for the Browns to fill!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Chicago bears will ever rise again.
You,would hope a,team,with their history will turn it around.
It would be good for the league.
I think so too.
I believe they open up with the falcons.
Well that's not the way to start a season.
Then they have Tampa,Pittsburgh and Green Bay.
Wow,they could start 0-4.
There is a,good chance of that yes.
How do they get such a tough schedule after going 3-13?
This is the NFL we're talking about.
I know,sometimes I can't figure them out.
I like John fox as a head coach though.
I like him too.
At least jay cutler is gone.
Right,he was a head case.
He had a rocket arm but was very erratic.
That's putting it mildly.
Mike Glennon should be an upgrade.
He should be at $16 million guaranteed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
No one cares about the Rams. Every team they've played has been mediocre.com
There couldn't be a team I dislike more.
Where was all this live when they were in St Louis.
Where's the love. You guys are bunch of hypocrites.
The Rams have ruined Sunday night football.
They have almost ruined all of football.
I've only seen three games this season. They've left such a bad taste in my mouth.
You literally haven't missed anything. The Rams are just an embarassment.
Have you caught any of the St Louis games.
Oh, I've seen all of the St Louis Games.
They started 3-1. At least they were competitive.
That means now they're going to go on a loosing streak.
They put together a team they knew would be garbage.
It's like the new coach is being set up to fail.
Either than or they trying to makes sure the team doesn't sale.
Who's their starting quarterback for Sunday.
Apparently they rotate. I'vee seen a new started for 3 games straight.
How on earthy do they strategize by rotating starters?
It's got them their 3 wins so far.
Yeah, but you can't think that's good long term.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Apparently not every town is a big supporter of their NFL football team.
Why's that?
The New York Jets want to build a helicopter pad at their training facility, and a nearby town is protesting it.
What are they complaining about, the helicopter noise?
That, and it's a safety risk if there's an accident.
Why do the Jets need the helicopter pad?
They want to use it for executive's travel, and for injured athletes to be quickly flown out.
Well, I'm sure no one cares about fat cat executives, but injured players is a good excuse for one.
There's an airport a couple of miles from there, so locals say there isn't that big a need.
Maybe so, but if a player has a really bad injury, transporting them by ambulance to the airport could be painful.
They already tried to propose it a couple years ago, but people objected a lot them.
So why are they bringing it up again?
They said they don't need permission from the locals because it is on state property owned by the Sports Authority.
So whose decision is it?
The state's Department of Transportation has to approve it.
What do you think the chances are with that?
Somebody from the state said they were considering the proposal.
Protestors have a way of stopping things though.
The Department of Transportation said the time limit for the public to appeal was over, but they were reading the comments.
Well, I personally hope they get it, because athletes need to have the best medical care available, and that includes medical transport.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you ready for some football?
Yes. Can't wait for the first game.
You. I can't wait to see Green Bay run the season.
Green Bay, get out of here. They are not going to the superbowl this year.
Why do you say that? They have one of the best quarterbacks in the league.
Who you talking about, Aaron Rodgers?
You know it. He has a ranking with touchdown to interception ratio of 4.12.
But what does that really mean?
That means for me, that Rodgers is number 1 quarterback in the NFL, and he can take his team to the superbowl.
I think you are forgetting the team has to do their part too.
No. Ha Ha, it just sounds like I'm getting ahead of myself. Looking forward to a good season.
Well, I'm going to stick with my boys from Houston Texas.
Your a Houston Texan fan?
You know it. They may have never made it to the Superbowl, but there is always potential.
Who is their quarterback?
I believe this year they are using Deshaun Watson from Cleveland.
Did they ever make it to the playoffs?
I know they did 3 or 4 times, but there could be more.
Well, I'll make sure to keep an eye out for these Texans you talk up so much.
Alright, and I hope your team has a good season. Peace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Derek Carr is finalizing a new deal with a Raiders?
No I didn't, who did you hear that from?
Per Adam Schefter. Deal is "close" to done and should be announced by the end of the week.
How much is the deal for?
$25 million per year.
That would make him the highest paid quarterback in the leauge, right?
Yes. Currently Andrew Luck is the highest paid quarterback, getting paid at $24.594 million yearly.
That's a lot of money. What % of the team's cap is that?
2017 cap is $167 million rite now, so roughly 15%. Next step in Mack I'm sure.
Mack will probably command around $22 million a year I think. Gonna be more than people expect. So two players would command 28% the Raider's cap, but without these two combined, the Raiders probably win 3 games instead of 12 last year.
Yeah this is all pretty crazy to say about 2 players.
Indeed but Carr is the focal point of the Raiders offense and Mack had so many strip fumble sacks to close the game out last year I lost count.
RIP Raiders' SB chances.
I wouldn't say that. The Raiders are a very young team.
As far as being competitive....gonna be tough. Once you commit that much money to 1, or especially two guys, your roster suffers.
As long as they win a Super Bowl in the next four years, the contracts will have no negative effect until then.
I guess everybody is just going to have to wait and see how all this plays out.
Yup, can't doing anything about it but in a few years the Raiders will be in Vegas and this could be huge for the team.
It could be but imagine if Carr or Mack gets hurt, that's all basically dead money at that point.
True but I think the Raiders have done a great job at protecting Carr when the ball is in his hands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey man
Man this is going to be cool
What is
The thing I am going to this week
Cool
Aren't you gonna ask what it is
Fine
What?
Where are you going?
To the steelers training camp
Sounds rad
It is going to be mind blowing
Have fun
I am sure I will
We're the tickets expensive
Not to much
That's good
Might go to season opener too
Now that'll be expensive
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Are you a fan of the NFL?
Oh yea, I love it !
How many games do you watch a week
I usually watch every night game and three on sunday
So you watch about six games a week ...right?
Yes, I never miss them.
Which network do you prefer to watch?
I think the best network is Fox.
Which announcers do you prefer?
I like Jimmy Johnson, I like his style.
Which teams do you like?
My favorite team is the Houston Texans.
Why do you like the Texans?
Because , I am from Houston and I really like the coach.
Who is the coach now, I knew Kubiak was fired.
The new coach is Bill O'Brien.
Do you think he can turn the team around this year?
Yes, with his background and J.J. Watt I think their chances are good.
Well, I hope they make the super bowl and you are happy!
Right, thanks and I hope you are right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Marshawn Lynch will have a good year?
I think so, he had a year to rest.
I think that it is nice that he gets to play for his hometown team.
Yea, especially considering that this is their last year in Oakland.
Yea, it is a real shame that they are moving.
I would be pretty mad if i lived in Oakland.
Do you think that the Patriots will repeat as champions?
I do not know, but I would not be surprised.
Me either, they have been so good for so long.
Yea, it is getting kind of ridiculous at this point.
I am just sick of seeing them win.
Me too, it is getting boring.
Do you think that browns will be better this year?
I hope so, those fans deserve at least one good year once in a while.
Right? As well as Buffalo Bills fans.
Yea, that is one tortured fan base.
I do not understand how you can be that bad year after year.
It confounds reason.
I just hope they make the playoffs.
It would be nice for their fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man. Ready for this upcoming NFL season?
You know it. I love football.
Same here. Who do you think is going to the Super Bowl this year?
I can see the Patriots and Cowboys playing each other.
That's too easy! I'm gonna say the Steelers and Saints play this year.
That is also plausible. Steelers look great.
Oh yeah. Big Ben, Brown, and Bell... wow.
Yeah, they should have beat the Pats last year!
I'm excited to see Marshawn's return to the field as well.
Oh, yeah. He's gonna be running fools over!
That's what I'm hoping for! Beastquake!
I wonder how the Seahawks fill about it.
Probably a bit upset, I'd imagine. He is one heck of a player.
I also wonder if Romo will come back after a little bit.
Yeah, I've heard he might, after he finishes announcing for a year.
I wonder which team he would fit in with...
No idea. He needs a great offensive line though, since he's so old.
Yes indeed. He has bones made of paper, it seems.
Are you excited about the preseason?
Oh, no doubt! I can't wait to be watching football!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I'm a Denver Bronco fan for life!
But Denver sucks!
But they don't!
They have no chance at the super bowl this year.
I dont care, i'm a fan win or lose.
Denver always chokes in the Super Bowl.
Well we have won three of them, they could never win again and they still would be my team.
Well I like winners.
Then your not a real fan, your just a band wagon fair weather fan.
So you dont think some can pick a team to root for in the super bowl?
Not if they didnt support that team all year long.
NFL Merhandising hates you!
Listen, I dont care!
Tom Brady was a way better quarterback than Elway.
That is probably true but debatable.
Steve Atwater was not as good as Ronnie Lott.
What is your deal? Who cares?
Dont you?
Im not, your a troll, your not even a real NFL fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go to the Eagles game in September with me?
Sure, I'd like to go.
They are playing the Giants.
That should be a great match up.
I know, but I do miss seeing Hynoski play.
He was a standout from rookie year.
Yes, he was great.
I hope he returns to the NFL.
Me too.
Do your kids like the mascots as much as mine?
You bet!
My kids love the mascots.
Mine go just for the food and mascots.
I know.  I think they'll eventually like football, though.
What other games do you want to see?
I would like to see the Eagles play the Redskins.
That would be cool as well.
I'd like to see the Eagles beat them.
I hope the Eagles go undefeated.
That would be awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What your thoughts on the eagles this year?
They can be in the mix.
Good move getting legarrette blount.
He'll definitely help.
You would think so.
He's good around the goal line.
Didn't he score eighteen touchdowns last year?
I believe so,yes.
They added Alshon Jeffery too.
A good wide receiver.
I'm not so sure about Carson wentz yet.
He's young but he had some good moments.
We'll see how he does this year.
They added a couple of defensive ends too.
Who did they get?
Chris long and Derek Barnett.
They will definitely help the defense.
I think so too.
They added defensive tackle Tim Jernigan too.
Oh wow,I didn't know that either.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Wow, you do know a lot about Football.
Thank you, I've been a fan ever since I was a kid.
And when did you start?
In 1999, where the Denver beat the Falcons for the title.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I see the Chiefs are coming out to Foxborough for opening day. Catch a flight and come out out.
Wow, I thought the Patriots would play the Falcon's opening day. That would be great.
Yes, I've been out here for 3 years, XX moved us out for a new job and I love the town.
Really, I haven't talked to you in 5 years I didn't know. I'd love to come out there.
Yes, 2 years ago with the Chiefs played the Patriots in the Playoffs, I had ticket but got sent to London the week of the game so my wife went with a friend.
What are the odds, that would suck.
Yes it did, oddly; it was a noon game so I was haunting the streets of Soho looking for a pub that was televising the game. Not what I envisioned with I bought the tickets.
Wow, you get to travel to England for work, amazing. So what weekend is that game?
They're playin Thursday, September 7 at Gillette Stadium. Opening day.
Definetly, I'll look into airfarer. I hear it's a pretty good tailgate.
I haven't been to a game, but Stacey said she was the only Chiefs fan in the endzone sears I got surronded by a lot of blue, red and silver.
How much are the tickets?
I don't know, I'm sure I can get a pair on Stubhub for $300 or $400, it being there not the quality of tickets.
Are the Chiefs anygood this year?
I don' t really know, they fired the GM, John Dorsey; relased their best receiver Jeremy Maclin so who knows.
Well, I've never been to a Patriots game so I'll look into tickets tomorrow.
Great, let me know, I think you can get airfare from KC to Logan Airport for around $300 this far in advanced. Look into Providence, RI too because it cheaper, less crowded and closer to Foxborough and our house.
Definetly,  I look them up tomorrow and get back to you.
Perfect, we haven't caught up in a long time and what a weekend to do it!
Your right, we should do thas more often.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorte team?
I have two, because I can't choose like that.
Fair enough, what are they?
My first is the Tampa Bay Buckeneers...
Seriously? I never hear that one.
Yeah, it's my family's team.
Family's team?
You know, everyone in my family likes them so I like them by association.
Oh okay, I guess that makes sense.
Yeah, my other favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.
I like the Steelers too!
Do you watch a lot of their games?
Not really, I always seem to be working whenever any are on.
Well, I just think they are a great team.
Yeah, they've won a lot I believe.
Games? Superbowls?
Well, obviously both if you win games to win the Superbowl....
Fair enough. When was the last time they won a Superbowl anyway?
I'm pretty sure like 2 or 3 years ago.
Yeah, something like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Steelers will do well this year?
They have one of the best quarterbacks in Ben Roethlisberger.
How do you think their running game will do?
It is hard to say.  It mostly depends on how well Le'Veon Bell plays.
Yes he can be problematic.
Exactly.  He has had off field issues as well that seem to hold back his game.
What about the wide recievers?
Obviously Antonio Brown is argueably the best reciever in the league.
Do you think Martavis Bryant will contribute much?
I hope he does.  Before his suspension he contributed several touchdowns and stretched the field.
How do you think the defense will hold up?
They would improve a lot by just taking William Gay out of the game.
You don't think he plays well?
No. I think he is one of the worst coverage backs in the league.
What would you do if you were coaching?
I would play Artie Burns on one side at corner and try a rookie on the other side.
How about the linebacker spot?
James Harrison is back again, and even at his age he still plays well.
Do you think he can hold up all year?
Probably so, but hopefully he will get some help from J.J. Watts brother at linebacker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the NFL draft at all?
I follow it a little bit.
Did you check out the rosters at all afterwards?
Yeah, I don't keep up with the draft but I always look over the rosters to see big changes.
Who do you think has the best offense in the coming season?
I think the Steelers are looking pretty scary.
I agree. I'm very excited about that.
They play really hard, too. It'll be fun to watch.
I totally agree. Ben Roethlisberger has a good team this year.
It'll be good to see him finally having the support he needs.
Yeah, he's had a rough go offensively in the past years.
I felt their defense was even worse.
I don't really remember much about their defense last year.
Still, offensively I think the Patriots are still going to be on top.
Yeah, it's hard to deny Tom Brady at this point.
I also have to say the Falcons will probably do very well again.
I honestly thought their offense was better than the Patriots last year.
I completely agree. They just were beaten when it mattered most.
That's because the patriots held the ball for the entire game.
True. They forced them to play defense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Woo to the hoo, training camp and preseasons games start up next month!
Yeah they do, I've been looking forward to this all year
Yep, football football football, best time of the year if you ask me
I'd have to agree with you, if I even thought there was a good time of the year
Oh buddy, why so glum?
Well I was a Colts fan but mostly because I was such a big supporter of what Peyton Manning did for that team year after year
He was a great athlete, still is, I could see why you were bummed when he got traded
well of course you can see why, I'm wearing a t-shirt depicting Andrew Luck's head on a stake
You sure are, pretty graphic
Welp, that's how most of the real fans wanted to do in Indy felt when Manning was released
No kidding, I was there, we couldn't quite corner Luck being an angry mob of mostly non-athletes and Luck being one of the more athelitc young QBs in the league
But he sure has proved his naysayers wrong
has he? We all said he sure was no Peyton manning, and I think so far that's proven 100% accurate, they are clearly different people, induspitably so
Spot on you were with that call. What about Russel Wilson, how much time you think he's got left in Seattle?
Welp if he goes, I go... out to the optomitrest, for a test, because I wouldn't believe my eyes to see anybody but Wilson suiting up at QB for the Seahawks
Not in this lifetime, am I right?
No, actually, we'll both probably outlive Russel Wilson's tenure as a QB in Seattle or in the leagure period
Welp, that's what some people probably said about Favre, and some of those people probably passed on before he retired, he was pretty old and some folks die unexpectedly young
Yeah, especially folks that eat cheese a lot and live near cows and like Green Bay
Yeah it's so cold they probably get a lot of colds and there's not much Vitamin C in cheese
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite team is the Carolina Panthers
I love them
They are a great team
Definitely
I love cam newton
He is my favorite player
He is mine too
He looks tall
He is 6'5"
Wow,  he is tall
Yes he is
And the best quarterback in the league
He definitely is
I saw a panthers game last year
I bet that was fun
It was
I want to go this year
Is a great experience
I bet
I want to go again
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
It's fun to watch!
What's your favorite team?
Bills!
A Buffalo fan, eh?
Yea, they're my team!
Haha...
How about you?
Patriots
Those guys are terrible cheaters!
Noooo!
They deflate balls...
Not proven!
Well the "proving" system is rigged
You can't prove that either!
Well I dont have the option to
I see we wont agree!
We can agree on that though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When do the NFL training camps start?
I think they are doing the OTA's right now and then camps start sometime in July after that.
I am going to try and make it out to see some of training camps this year.  Tickets are free.
Yeah, the Seahawks have their camp in Renton right on Lake Washington.
I went to the Cowboays training camp last year and it was cool to see Dak Prescott before he became the starter.
I try to go to camp and maybe a preseason game.   Tickets are generally more affordable for preseason.
I know, tickets for regular season games have gotten so expensive.
They go for hundreds of dollars a game here per ticket.  I can't afford that.
You should come out to see a game in Dallas sometime though.
I know, the stadium there that Jerry Jones built looks incredible.
Are they still having Thursday Night Football every week this year?
I think so.  I don't like Thursday night games either.
The NFL is so overexposed.   It used to be just Sunday and Monday.
Now it's 3, sometimes 4 days a week when they have those Saturday night games.
I'm not into the NFL games in London either.
Tell me about it.  Games have started at 6:30 AM on the west coast!   I'm not waking up for that.
It's such a disadvantage for teams to have to travel to London anyway.
The NFL definitely wants to put a team there.  I don't get it.
It's all about money for the NFL owners.
The NFL says they care about fans, but how is a team having to give up a home game to play in London caring about fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am ready for football.
I am ready to watch the Raiders.
Didn't they move this year
They moved to Las Vegas
I wonder if that will affect the players.
I think it may in a way but the new ones it wont.
They did good last year in the playoffs.
I am a big fan.
I like the raiders.
I do to they are one of my favorites.
I hope them being in a gambling city does not affect them.
Me too that would be devastating.
It is good if they needed to though.
I agree.
Other teams have moved before.
I think the rams may have.
I am not sure.
Roger Goodell approves them.
So that must mean it was for a reason.
Yes I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Andrew Luck?
I think he's alright.
He's my favorite player.
Really, that's interesting.  Why?
Even as a rookie he proved himself to be able to play with the best.
He did do very well from the start.
You just don't see that anymore.
I agree new quarterbacks are always questionable.
Do you think he will be as good as Peyton Manning?
I don't know that's a tough one, Peyton is one of the best ever.
That's true I just like him and hope so.
He is pretty good already.
Do you think he will be able to get MVP at some point?
I don't think anytime soon with Peyton and Brady still playing.
Don't forget about Rodgers as well.
Do you think he will ever break any records?
I think he's already broken some of the rookie ones.
I mean all time records.
That's interesting, I think so eventually.
Yeah, maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, it should be a great season.
Yea, there are a lot of teams that just seem to be ready to really complete.
What do you think of Tampa this year?
Well, Winston seems to really rally the troops. I like them.
Yea, they added Desean and that should help.
Yea, that guy is a playmaker, but he has to stay healthy.
Tampa should be able to make some noise this year, but it may not be enough.
Yea, I like Tampa. I also like Tennessee.
Yea, they have some players on offense with Murray and Marriota.
Yea, they can really score. They showed some signs last year.
I agree. Now if only they could play a little more defense.
It seems like these young quarterbacks are really running the league early.
Yea, having a good young quarterback goes a long way in this league.
I agree! Those who have them tend to win.
Yea, but you cannot expect to win right away.
Thats true! Some take longer than others.
Yea and some start out good and then flounder.
Wow, thats you RGIII. Wherever you are!
That was a good one. I do not know what is up with him.
Yea, his career may be just about over unfortunately.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name me your top five players in the NFL?
That is a very difficult question!
I Know! You are the biggest NFL fan I know so I figured you would be the right person to ask.
Are you talking about five different positions, or what?
It does not matter what position they play. Simply your top five in the league.
I got it, this could take me a while though!
That is fine by me. I am just interested in hearing your picks.
I guess I would start my list off with Arron Rodgers.
Are you going in order by the way?
No, I am not naming them in any particular order.
Rodgers is a great first choice by the way.
My second and third players would be Julio Jones and Von Miller.
I like those picks, both of those guys are dominant at their positions.
Then I would go with Richard Sherman. He is a lock down corner.
Yea, he is the foundation of the Seahawk's defense.
My last pick would probably be Tom Brady.
Even though he is basically forty years old?
Did you see what he just did in the Superbowl last year?
I know, he is amazing to do what he does at his age.
So there you have it, my top five NFL players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the 49er's season this year?
Not great.  How do you feel about the Raider's season this year.
I actually feel pretty good.
Who's you favorite NFL player right now?
I'm always a fan of Sebastian Janokowsky.  Who's your favorite player right now?
I think Aaron Rodgers.
Yeah, he's a class act.
So at what point do you think they just start playing touch football in the NFL?
Why because of all the concussion and injury concern?
Yeah.  It is legit scary and sad to see famous football players with head trauma and death from suicide, but I guess it's an inherent risk to the game.
I think the larger is more the cumulative effects from having full contact practices and games from the age of 4 on.
I wonder who's going to be the halftime performer this year.
Has Taylor Swift ever done it.
No.  It's only a matter of time before Taylor Swift does it.
Who was your favorite halftime performer?
Probably Timberlake.  How bout you? Gaga?
I actually think Katy Perry and Left Shark was my favorite.
Kendrick Lamar would be perfect, but he would never be invited.
I don't think he has enough of a hit base or a wide enough audience or recognition
That's true.  They should just get the Killers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
With the Miami Dolphins Tight ends, the big question is Julius Thomas.
No question about it.  Miami traded for him in the off-season, but will they get the player from Denver or Jacksonville.
They are definitely hoping for the player who caught 24 touchdowns his last two years in Denver.
Yes, he did that in an offense led by Adam Gase, just like he has in Miami.
But that team also had Peyton Manning.  Without him he had two bad years in Jacskonville.
True.  But while Tannehill certainly is no Peyton Manning, he is much better than what they have in Jacksonville.
Was it just the touchdowns that were a concern in Jacksonville?
There are some major concerns.  Every year since 2013 he has played fewer games and averaged fewer yards per catch.
And fewer receptions.
Almost, he caught three more in 2015 than in 2014, but then 16 fewer in 2016.  He only caught more than 50 passes once.
So he is a big risk, they really don't know what they are getting.
No, they don't, and there are some concerns that he does not seem to be building a rapport with Tannehill.
So, what is the fallback if he doesn't pan out?
There is not much of one.  MarQueis Gray had a couple good games, but he does not seem to be much of an option.
What about Thomas Duarte?
Some people had high hopes for him, but he still needs to develop before he can contribute.
They brought old vet Anthony Fasano back.
Yes, but he is there mostly to block at this point.
But he could end up playing on a lot of downs.
If Thomas doesn't pan out, it will be a lot of Fasano and sets with no tight end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you plan on watching football next year?
I usually don't start watching until the playoffs.
Do you have a favorite NFL team?
Not really, probably the Patriots now. Their Super Bowl victory last year was pretty amazing.
You like The Patriots? Did you hear about Tom Brady deflating footballs?
I don't think he ever admitted to it. Even if he did, it wouldn't give him that big of an advantage.
Probably right, only the greatest quarterback ever could have come back like that in the Super Bowl against Atlanta.
I'm not sure he's the greatest, that's debatable. After all, Terry Bradshaw won four super bowls.
Yeah, Bradshaw wasn't as good as someone like John Elway or Joe Montana.
It's amazing Bradshaw won four, I think it had more to do with the Pittsburgh Steelers defense.
Agreed, that's how the Baltimore Ravens and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers won their super bowls.
Any prediction on who is going to the Super Bowl next year?
You can't bet against the Patriots, but I hope to see the Seattle Seahawks make a return.
Seattle has a good quarterback, Russell Wilson is one of the best.
I don't know if he's one of the best, but definitely one of the most mobile.
Who is the most mobile quarterback ever?
In my mind, it was Steve Young. One of the first games I saw him play filling in for Joe Montana, and he ran for about 60 yards on one play.
Did Steve Young ever win a Super Bowl? All I remember about him is that he was Joe Montana's backup.
Steve Young has three Super Bowl rings. Two of them with Joe Montana as starting quarterback, the third when he was the starter.
He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2005. I guess a lot of people thought he was pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What a fan of the Los Angeles Rams I am!
Me too! At least I was a fan.
Oh no! What happened?
They left Saint Louis.
Yes, yes they did. Are members of your family still fans?
Some are, some aren't. I couldn't imagine still being a fan.
That must be hard on the family.
Not really, it's not as hard as some other things.
How do you think Geoff will do?
I hope well. We spent a first round pick on him.
How has he done so far?
Not well. He has a losing record overall.
Is that his fault or Fisher's?
It could be the coach but I think it's more his fault than anything else.
He can run the plays, Fisher cannot.
Yes. Is he a good game manager?
I think he's more of a leader than a Russel Wilson manager type.
Should they be a run-first team?
I don't know. The running back isn't good either.
I certainly wish them the best, even with Gurley as a running back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to an NFL game before?
Twice, both times with my Auntie.
How did you afford it?
Well this was way back in the 1980s.
A lifetime ago.
Pretty much. She had season tickets for the Vikings.
Oh yeah, you told me about that outside winter game you went to.
I never understood why anyone would play outside in a frozen tundra like Minnesota. Have an indoor stadium, jeesh.
What was the other game? Vikings, too?
No, I had just seen urban Cowboy and was interested in Dallas so asked my Aunt to take me there.
I forgot you used to travel with her a lot.
Yes. And while there we bought same day tickets to see a Cowboys vs Bears game.
Same day tickets? That's a thing of the past.
Tell me about it. They were cheap, too. We sat way up in a nose bleed section but I didn't care.
Did you manage to have any fun at the game?
Sure. You know I like the concession stand food!
That's all you liked about it?
No, we were seated behind 4 Chicago Bears fans.
What was fun about that?
This was back when their team sucked. Bears fans took to wearing paper bays over their heads with cut outs for the eyes to hide their identity. I still have a photo of those 4 guys with bags over their heads with "Bears Fan' written on them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the AFC West this year?
I think it will be either the Broncos or Raiders.
The Raiders were good then they fell apart when they lost Derek Carr.
Yes, that really hurt them in the playoffs.
What happened with Denver last year?
They lost both of their QBs then had to start their third string from the Super Bowl year.
Peyton Manning retired and Brock Osweiler went to the Texans.
It was the defense that won it all a couple years ago.
True but you still need a quarterback.
It's been a wierd offseason for the AFC West.
The Chargers are moving to Los Angelos.
And the Raiders will be moving to Los Vegas.
Los Vegas Raiders?
That sounds wierd doesn't it?
I wish they would stop moving teams.
I hate it when teams move from their traditional city.
NFL doesn't respect the fans that make it in the end.
Especially if the team has been in a city for years and years.
I forgot about the Kansas City chiefs.
They are always competitive to win the division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So will you be watching football this year?
I'm not sure.  I used to love the Buffalo Bills...
It sounds like you don't anymore.  What happened?
Well, my favorite player was Doug Flutie.
Yes, he was amazing.  So what's the deal?
Do you remember when they replaced him in the playoffs after he got them there?
Oh yea, that was a long time ago though!
I know but it soured me on the team.
I thought it made sense...
How can you say that?  He was the quarterback who got them there in the first place!
I know but they had to make the decision they thought was best for the team.
That obviously backfired!
You never know what would have happened...
True, but I know what did happen.  Management proved themselves to be disloyal and they lost anyway.
You sure sound angry after all this time.
They were my favorite team as my grandfather was from Buffalo.
Well, that makes sense.  So you don't watch at all anymore?
I might this season.  Who are you rooting for?
The New England Patriots, of course!
I'm so tired of hearing about that team!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's going on with the Cleveland Browns?
I have no idea, I just hope they do good this year.
I'm not real familiar with the newer players.
Yes, I miss the old guys but I guess they weren't very good.
The classic Browns were awesome.
Yes, but they never won a super bowl.
Do you like the Steelers?
No way. Got friends that do.
If you're from Cleveland and are a Pittsburg Steelers fan, you are a traitor.
Yes, I don't get it.
I hope the Carolina Panthers do good.
Why is that?
I like their logo and colors. I used to play Madden years ago.
That was so fun, good times. I miss playing XBOX all the time.
Are there any other teams you like?
Not really; no player crushes either.
My husband lives fantasy football all year round.
I guess you can make money that way if you know what you're doing.
I always look forward to the NFL super bowl every year.
Yes, it's like a holiday. It doesn't matter which teams play.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, just a little under 3 months and Football Season starts.
I can't wait. You still rootin for the Texans?
You know it!
J.J. Watt playing this year?
Of course! I was just reading an article about him the other day.
What did it say?
Thry interviewed J.J. and he was saying he can't wait to grt on the field.
I don't doubt it, he was strong last season untill that back injury.
Yes, it was devistating. I think the Texans would have went a lot farther had that not happened.
Agreed, J.J is a wrecking machine!
True. Coach O'Brien said he is looking good in practice.
I'm glad he recovered.
Deshawn Watson is itching to get on the field as well.
Oh, cool, he was having some trouble last year.
Well, the rookie years can be tough.
That's true.
I have a feeling his sophmore season will be much better.
Well, he's nominated for 2 ESPY's so he has potential.
He has talent as well.
I wholeheartly agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Yes I cannot wait until this NFL season starts
Do you think Jarvis Landry will get a contract extension before the season starts?
The Miami Dolphins need to make sure they sign him if they want to win games against those Patriots
What's your favorite team?
My team is anyone not names the Patriots
Yes I agree they have had their time in the spotlight but what a dynasty they have built
I would agree with you if they hadn't had so many cheating scandals
Do you honestly think any other team has a chance to win the superbowl this year besides the Patriots?
I can see the Oakland Raiders beating the Patriots if Derek Carr stays healthy.
Yeah if Beastmode comes back to his Seahawk days of old and runs people over.
I agree he is the ultimate wildcard on that team. Have you seen him training on the beach?
I have and have you ever tried beach football?
No. What do you think about the Carolina Panthers?
I think they only go as far as Cam Newton allows them to go.
But that defense is still elite.
I like the Pittsburgh defense better personally
Yes James Harrison is still a beast
My favorite defender in the league is Cam Wake though.
He is ageless and seems to only get faster each year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the greatest game in NFL history.
That is a hard one.
I know!  There are so many great games.
Recently, there were a lot of Brady and Manning games that were good.
I would say the 1993 Monday Night Football Game at Mile High Stadium was the greatest?
Why would you say that?
It was Kansas City versus Denver.
Joe Montana versus John Elway.
Yeah.  The game was close the whole way through.
I remember that game.
Kansas City was down and then Montana led them back.
Then John Elway led the Broncos down the field to go ahead.
Then Montana with just over a minute led Kansas City the whole way down the field to win the game in the closing seconds.
Yeah.  I didn't think that there was enough time left to do that.
I didn't either.
That was back when they didn't throw the ball all up and down the field like they do now.
Yeah.  Do you remember what the announcer said when Montana won the game?
I do.  He said "Lord take me now.  I've seen it all."
That was classic.
Yeah.  It was a showdown between two legends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Atlanta will be good again?
I think they will.
I do too.
I'm not sure they'll be good enough to make it to the SUPERBOWL again.
Yea,I'm not sure either.
Matt Ryan is one of the best though.
Oh I agree with that.
It still takes a lot to get to the big game.
It takes some luck too.
Oh sure it does.
The ball has to bounce your way at times.
Yes it does.
Julio Jones is outstanding.
He could be the best in the game.
He's surely right up there.
Justin hardy can be good.
I like him as a returner.
Yea,he's a force.
Matt Bryant can still kick.
Yes he can.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite team?
Eagles
Eagles?
Yup
That's horrible
No its not
Dude it is
nope
if you say so
i do
horrible players
we've had good ones
like who
donovan mcnabb
oh the dude who couldn't win a super bowl
ron jaworski
he's annoying on espn
I'll give you that one
you'll give me that they're horrible too
we'll stop there
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you plan on following a team this year.
I always follow the Jets.
Well, I hope you have a better season.
Doubtful, how bout you.
I'm a Cowboys fan.
Oh, you'll probably have a great year.
yeah, there are concerns but we're loaded with talent
What are the concerns.
Well Zeke had some legal troubles, then there are always injuries.
I think Zeke will be fine.
I hope so!
What injuries.
Well, we don really have a backup QB.  If Dak gets hurt we're screwed.
I see.  but he's young not like Romo.
Yeah,  other than that it's looking good.
That O-line is awesome.
Yeah, Dak and Zeke get the press but the football smart people know the O-line is the star.
Yeah, Dak and Zeke get the press but the football smart peo
Ha, even I could run.
Umm, yeah...No.  lol
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't think much of today's NFL players. They don't really have the skills and passions of the older guys.
Yeah, I know what you mean. All my favorite players retired at least 20 years ago.
Who are some of your favorites?
I have quite a few actually. To begin with, there's Fran Tarkenton.
Scramblin' Fran Tarkenton. I remember him; he was great.
He was one of the best ever, but somehow he always seemed to lose the big game.
He just didn't have the players to support him, I think.
You're probably right. Of course, there are other great players like Eric Dickerson.
I remember watching Dickerson in high school. My team played his Sealy team in the state playoffs.
What happened? Dickerson ran all over my team, just like he did to every defense in the NFL.
No kidding. Him and Larry Csonka and Rocky Bleier. Those guys just couldn't be stopped.
Don't forget Jim Brown. He was probably the most unstoppable of all.
What about defensive players? Did you have any old-time favorites?
Oh, I have plenty. Deacon Jones, Ed 'Too Tall' Jones, 'Mean' Joe Greene, and the rest of them.
I forgot about 'Mean' Joe Greene and his Coke commercial. That was classic.
Yeah, all those old guys made some great commercials. Of course, Peyton Manning makes great commercials nowadays.
He does, but Peyton Manning is the exception. His commercials are always fun, but nobody else does such good commercials.
I guess you're right about that. So how about kickers?
Kickers are easy. No one beats George Blanda and Morten Andersen.
I suppose you're right about that. They were the best, probably of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Are you going to watch the NFL this year? Are you excited for camp?
Yes, but I don't know if I will watch much this year. I think it is not as entertaining as it used to be.
Do you think the Patriots will repeat?
They have a strong chance too. The rest of the division is bad which means an automatic trip to the playoffs.
It will be awkward for the Raiders to keep playing in Oakland.
I know. I don't think they'll play the full 3 years there. Maybe they'll play somewhere else or move early.
At least the Raiders are good though. And they have Marshawn Lynch.
Yeah. Carr is getting paid a lot to play this year.
I think the Chargers won't get any fans this year either. LA doesn't need or want a second bad team.
The Rams didn't get a ton of fans either, so I can't imagine this is a slam dunk investment.
Who's your favorite player to watch?
I really like Julio Jones on Atlanta. He's huge and fast. Atlanta should have won the Super Bowl.
Do you think that it's a good idea for Roger Goodell to stay in the commissioner's office with all of his controversies?
I don't think he knows what he's doing, and this Redskins problem isn't going away.
Are you in favor of the team name changing?
Yeah. It's pretty offensive and the history of how it came about is too. Snyder is a terrible owner and Cousins will probably leave after this year.
Is it that bad? Cousins has some talent but he is wild.
The team doesn't treat or engage with him like they should, and it shows. He requested a trade, it's only a matter of time.
Oh well. At least the season starts soon! I'm excited for Marshawn to be back in my life!
It'll be fun to watch at least. I probably won't play fantasy football though. Just enjoy it for what the NFL is.

The Buffalo game is on.
Ok great.
Buffalos are in the lead now.
Not for long!
What???
The Tigers will catch up!
You wish.
They've got Damon on the field.
And we've got Simon Dills!
He's trash!
He's had better seasons, but still good.
Not good.
I think he's on his way out.
We'll see tonight!
Touchdown!!
No!!!
This game is heating up.
It sure is.
Let's go Buffalos, let's go!
Tigers eat buffalos for dinner!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the NFL is losing popularity?
I don't think so.
I do.
Why is that?
Well with esports growing and kids not playing sports as much these days I think it is slowly losing popularity.
I never thought about that.
Yeah sadly I think eventually it won't be nearly as big as it is now.
That's a little sad.
That's being said I think ti will always hold a good popularity.
I can't see it ever dying out.
Me either.
Do you think the game will change much in say fifty years?
That's too hard to say.
I think it will, there have been so many rules since the early 90s as is.
Do you think it will be more easy going?
What do you mean?
I mean do you think it won't be smash mouth football anymore?
Definitely.
That's sad.
It protects the players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you been following news of the Oakland raiders?
No, what's happening with them.
Well, this team has parted with 3 of their players.
Which ones did they let go?
I believe it was Andy Mulumba, Anthony Kukwa, and Neiron Ball.
No way, I wonder why.
I don't know about the other 2, but I do know that Ball missed last year, because of his knee injury and several surgeries.
Well that leaves this team with 3 vacanies.
Yeah and I wonder who will get to fill them.
Recently, I read about their former quarterback; Todd Marinovich.
Didn't he have a drug problem?
Yeah, but, he claims he has been sober since August of 2016.
Well good for him. He got let go back in 1993, right?
Yes. And sobriety is always good.
I will never understand the athletes that give into things that destroy their careers.
Right. It is not everyday that you make it to the NFL.
Ha ha, I could only dream.
I know that's right, my days are over; too old.
Your never too old, from what I hear, Todd Marinovich is 48 and trying for a comeback, but not with the NFL.
I heard. It is with the SoCal Coyotes of the World Developmental Football League. Good luck to him. Go Raiders!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey buddy, what's your favorite team?
The Philadelphia Eagles!
Cool man. You like Carson Wentz?
Yeah, he's young, but I like him.
Yeah. He throws a bit weird.
He misses high a lot, but I think he has great potential.
You like the free agents they signed?
Yup! Love Alshon Jeffrey!
He's good but always hurt. But I see why they signed him
Yeah, you gotta take risks though, you know?
I think the Carolina Panthers win it all this year.
They could. They have a QB & defense.
Yeah, seems like everything after that falls into place.
I usually like teams in warmer weather though to win it all.
Like Tampa or Miami?
Yes. Easier to play in that weather I think.
I don't know, man. It can be difficult playing on the cold in December.
Yeah, but how often does it snow during a game?
I see your point. Who knows who will win the Super Bowl?
Can't wait to watch and find out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats up
Who's the greatest running back ever?
Gale Sayers
Wrong
Why not?
Didn't play a long career
So
Many players played a longer career with better stats
He got hurt.
But if you took the years he did play and compare them there's nobody really better
Jim Brown
He's up there
Emmit Smith
Nope
Walter Payton
Gale still has him beat
Barry sanders
He's the modern day Gale
Only if he played for a better team
His numbers would have been amazing
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who you think will be this years MVP?
Tough to say since there are so many great players
You have to your eye on someone who you think has a chance.
I guess I would go with Leveon Bell.
Bell? Really!
Yeah I think as long as he stays out of trouble than he can get the stats needed for the MVP.
I guess I can see that. Staying out of trouble is going to be key for him.
Yeah, he was great again last year despite being suspended.
Plus they get Martavius Bryant back from suspension which should help out the passing game.
Getting him back should help get safetys out of the box on run support.
Steelers are looking like they could make another superbowl push with all the pieces they have.
I agree, only thing is people are not sure how long Roethlisberger will be around.
I forgot he was thinking about retiring this past season.
Yeah he was, its unfortunate because he is a great QB despite his age
He always is playing hurt from what I can remember.
That is no lie. He is a tough guy though.
No doubt. One of the toughest QBs to ever play the game.
Yep, but Bell is my pick for MVP.
Bell has a solid chance, but will have some stiff competition.
Your right, there are many good running backs out there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've read that the Cowboys could be in for a slump this year.
I wouldn't be surprised.
I wouldn't either really.
Every thing seemed to fall into place last year.
On offense they did.
Right,I think their defense could be worse.
I don't see much improvement.
Is dak Prescott going to be as good?
NFL defense have a way of figuring out quarterbacks their second year in.
Yes,things can even out.
They do have a good offensive line though.
Yes they do.
And a good running back.
Yes,Elliot is good.
To me,dez Bryant is not a big game player.
He does come up short when the games get tough
Also ,can he stay healthy is a good question.
The same health question for Jason witten too.
He's coming back,from an injury.
Yes,and he's getting older and is been beat up over the years
XXXXXXXXXXX
Still the winningest team in superbowl history is the steelers.
And with Big Ben under center, they still have more chances to add to their total.
Yep. Big ben was the youngest QB ever to win the superbowl
Yes, but he's 35 now.
That's plenty young enough to at least a couple of more superbowls.
Maybe.
it would be so awesome to see. if Steelers go to superbowl two more time, they're aty even ten appearances.
Patriots need just one more.
Yes, but Steelers have higher percentage wins. 8 total, and 6 wins out of that 8
Cowboys are at 8 also, but only won 5
There are 3 teams who went to the superbowl 8 times.
Yep. Broncos being the third one. Only won 3 out of those 8 though.
These percentages are meaningless. Ravens won all their superbowls, but they've only went twice.
it's funny how there are still teams that never even went to the superbowl, like ever.
Haha, yes. Browns, Lions, Teans, and Jaguars.
How do these team stay in business?
It's a local loyalties from the fans.
My teasm, my city type of thing?
Yes, of course. So what if they always lose, it's your team nonetheless
That's the thing about loyal fans, They never let you down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do the Saints play first this year?
They play the vikings
That will be an okay game
Considering how well the vikings did last year it will be bleak I think
Yeah. The saints need a mix up
Brees is ready to retire I think
I don't think Payton will let him
Sean Payton isn't doing much either
Yeah, he's probably in his last coaching days.
Are there any new coaches you think will do well?
Anthony Lynn is building a pretty good team with the Chargers
I think the Rams coach is building up a nice team as well.
Sean McAvoy is good. We'll see about that QB though
He's got wade phillips to make jarred goff look like a star though
True. He's a great Defensive coordinator
Sean McDermott has a big job over with the Bills
Yeah. taking over after Marrone left will be hard
He's got to rebuild the whole structure I think
That's hard for a new coach to do
He seems like a good leader.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really think Tom Brady is going to win.
Perhaps I should agree. He is old but he is experienced.
He has a lot of energy for an old guy.
I agree.
So, are you going to watch the game with your family?
No, I do not think so.  My family members are not into footballs.
If you like, you can come to my house.
Who are coming?
Some friends from work.
I have to consult with my spouse.
Your spouse is invited too.
Thank you very much.  I will tell her.
What do you think about the new Seahawks' QB?
Who is he?
His name is Austin Davis.
He used to play for Denver Broncos, right?
Yes, during the 2016 season.
I heard of him, but not very much.
Anyway, let me know if you would like to come to my place for the game.
I will talk to my wife this evening.  I will let you know tomorrow.  Thanks again for the invitation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think Drew Brees will do this season?
I don't know but I'm excited to see.
Do you think this will be Drew Brees' last season?
Yeah. I think it's about time for him to retire.
Can the Saints go all the way this year?
I hope so. We have some pretty decent commitments so we'll see!
Do you think this is Sean Peyton's last year?
Without a doubt. He looks like he's ready to retire.
Do you really think the Rams and the Browns will lose every single game?
Based on their team and how many odds are stacked against them, yep!
How do you think Brandin Cooks will work out with the Patriots?
I think he'll be just fine. Still can't believe we lost him!
They're saying Aaron Rodgers is the best QB in the NFL. Do you agree?
He's great but I do think there's better. I'd love to say Drew Brees but last season was awful!
How do you feel about the rules to the Touchdown celebration dance getting more relaxed?
I LOVE it! I mean c'mon, half of those people will only do that once in their lifetime, let them celebrate!
I'm hearing the Cowboys are looking good. Do you think they will live up to the hype?
I hope not. The top 3 teams I despise are Falcons, Bucs, and Cowboys.
Do you think it's a good idea for Amazon to stream the NFL games?
I do. I think it will bring more business to Amazon and make the people who already have Prime happy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think that Adrian Peterson will come back strong this year?
I just don't have faith in him.
Really, you've given up on his career?
No, not given up, but I just am not sure if he can recover his greatness.
Oh I see, and I actually agree with you on this one.
I had Peterson on my fantasy football team last year, and he did horribly.
Yes, I drafted him as my first pick in fantasy too.
Well he got hurt the first or second game, and that was pretty much the end of his season.
Yes, it was a crushing blow for Minnesota.
Yeah, he carried so much of that team.
I do remember a couple years back that he recovered from another injury quite well.
Yes, he was a monster in rushing yards the next season.
Everyone, including analysts and experts, were saying that his career was over before he came back.
Yeah, and Peterson proved them all wrong immediately.
That's when he was getting a lot of praise, and people were calling him a freak of nature.
I couldn't believe that he healed that fast, and was better than ever after that injury.
So you don't think that Peterson will do the same thing again?
I guess now that I am reminded of that other injury a few years ago, I might still believe in him.
Does that mean that you will draft him in fantasy football this year?
I probably will, but I definitely won't draft him in the first couple rounds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about LA getting two teams this year?
I think its a really bad move for the NFL. I don't see how LA will support one team let alone two.
Yes but they are the second biggest market in the country.
True, but its just not a football town. LA is a lot like San Diego and San Diego never supports football.
I feel bad for St Louis and Oakland. They seemed like decent football towns.
Yes. I think that is the second time both of these cities lost their teams.
A lot of times there is more than meets the eye when teams move.
Yes. I don't think St Louis was bringing a lot of fans in.
No, they really weren't. However, the Rams have been a bad team for a long time.
I wonder if the NFL will finally concede that these two cities cannot support football.
A lot of it has to do with having an organization that is committed to winning. The fans will follow.
This is true. But I don't think the city should suffer because of bad ownership.
In surprised they elected to put both teams in LA. There were so many options.
I know. Law Vegas has been asking for a team for a long time.
I don't know if Vegas would support a team though. Nobody is from Lad Vegas.
That's true. But there would be a good following for the visiting team.
At least those in Oakland have another team right across the bay.
Right. That might be why it was tough to maintain a second team.
I wonder if there are just too many teams.
That could be. There are only so many markets that can support the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the Lions' season?
Yup! I hope they have a good team this year.
Me too. They always find ways to disappoint.
I just hope I can watch the games this year.
You don't watch the games?
Rarely.
Why not?
The stupid blackout policy the commissioner thinks is necessary.
What's that? I've always seen the games.
The NFL says that if a certain percentage of tickets aren't sold in the stadium, that local and regional airings of the game are blacked out.
Meaning what?
It doesn't air. At all.
What? That's not fair!
Right, I know.
Why do they have that policy?
Ticket sales. If everyone watches it at a bar or at home, the team makes far less money.
I get that, but it's still unfair.
Right, there's always a portion of the population who dies to go to the game to get the live experience.
Plus not everyone can afford the tickets.
I guarantee you if they make tickets far less expensive, they'll make the same amount of money and have all games sold out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really miss the NFL at the moment!
I do to, life just seems empty without football!
I know the feeling. We are getting close to the pre-season though!
It always feels like Christmas in my family when the NFL returns.
Yea, me and my dad always set down in front of the TV with some drinks and nachos to kick off the season.
Who is your favorite team?
I am a huge Minnesota Vikings fan!
They have a good young team. I bet you are excited for the future.
I sure am, I have a lot of faith in Mike Zimmer.
Yea, he seems to be doing a pretty good job with them so far.
I feel like we have the foundation to become a playoff team year after year.
Teddy Bridgewater seems to be an outstanding young quarterback.
He really is; I am very excited to watch him grow.
Which draft pick are you the most excited about?
I want to see how good Dalvin Cook can be. He has tons of potential.
He is the running back out of Florida State, correct?
Yes, he is a very fast and physical runner that reminds me of Adrian Peterson.
If he turns out to be that good then you will be very happy, right?
I sure will! Peterson is my favorite Viking of all time.
I can see why, he turned out to be a legend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Bears fan at all?
I really don't like the Bears.
Understandable. So, I guess you're a Packers fan?
I'm more partial to the Packers, yeah.
The Bears had a really rough time last season.
Yeah, I feel like they're losing fans.
I can't believe they only had three wins last season.
It doesn't seem like they'll have many more this coming season either.
Yeah, I feel like they gave up too much in the draft.
Me too. It wasn't worth losing their picks for a quarterback.
I agree to an extent. They did need a quarterback, though.
Yeah, but they still have huge problems in their defense that could have been addressed.
True, they did pick up a tight end, though.
They got Sheenan, right?
Yeah, and Trubinsky as a quarterback.
Trubinsky was actually the top prospect for quarterbacks.
Yeah, he was. I still think they gave up way too much for him.
I agree. Trubinsky and Sheenan are not going to be able to carry the team themselves.
Definitely not. They're still ranked 32nd overall.
That's not the spot you want to be in starting off a new season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the favorite to win the Super Bowl this year?
I haven't see, but I'm guessing the Patriots.
Yeah I'd bet that would be the most likely.
I think Dallas, Atlanta, and Oakland will be in the running too.
How about Oakland?  I like their QB, Carr.
He is really good.  Hopefully his broken leg is healed.
I forgot about that.  He broke it right before the playoffs.
Yes and Houston was having QB problems too.  What a bad game to watch.
It sure was.  I think Houston will be better this year now that Osweiler is gone.
He seemed like he'd be good, but I think he has confidence issues in the pocket.
I still can't believe Houston didn't want Romo.
That would've been a great fit for both of them.
Houston has a great defense and just neede and experience QB.
I know, but I think money was a problem.  Romo calling NFL games should be interesting.
I think he will do okay.  He did get a great job though.
He sure did.  He got in the booth with Jim Nantz.
Nantz is great. Like how he calls an NFL game.
Don't forget the Masters!
He does college basketball too, but I think he is best doign the NFL games.
Well he has Romo to carry now.  Hopefully they are a good pair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football this season?
I've been ready since last season ended.
Lol Who are you rooting for this time, your beloved Cowboys?
Of course they still hold the record for the most Super Bowl wins, which is saying a lot about your precious Packer!
Hey even though they have been on a losing streak I have faith in my Packers!
Yes me too, the faith of a mustard seed lol
Okay we will see about that when we beat the Cowboys and knock them out of the running for the Super Bowl.
That can never happen, you guys should focus on your defense instead of other teams.
Our defense will be better then ever this year, we're going to the ship lol!
To get past us you'll have to get through your toughest competition, The Bears lol
We sending them bears back to the woods for good this season and just for all the jokes I will be making a roster.
Bout time now I can finally take some of your money for a change.
We will see about that, I don't like losing and I really don't like losing my money.
Well get used to it because I plan to clean you out, Matter of fact first 3 games will be held at my house.
Cool then i'll host the following 3 and we can just go from there.
Wanna go to the mall to buy more football gear and things.
I'm always down for new Packers gear!
When is the first game this season?
September 7th is the Kickoff Game.
Right I believe it starts at 8:30 pm
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
I do. It's my favorite sport.
Did you watch the Super Bowl last year?
Yeah. I watch it every year.
That was one of the most entertaining super bowls I have ever seen.
It definitely was. I couldn't believe the Patriots came back.
Yeah, I only wish it were the Broncos playing instead.
You're a Broncos fan, I take it?
Big time. I was disappointed with last season.
I could see how you would be.
At least the Patriots put on a good show.
They truly did. I felt bad for the Falcons.
I think the whole world felt bad for the Falcons in the fourth quarter.
It's hard to say it wasn't their fault. They threw that game.
Tom Brady definitely embarrassed them.
In my opinion they allowed him to do it. They knew they would be looking at big pass plays.
Yeah, they should have used more deep zone coverage.
Definitely, you can't just allow that many big passes in the fourth quarter.
I agree. Some of the passes were sketchy, though.
Yeah, the Patriots definitely squeezed out that win by the skin of their teeth.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you going to watch the super bowl today?
I think I will its going to be really exciting to see these two teams play.
Yes I think the score will be really close may even go into overtime on this one.
I always get excited when the game is close and the tension get really up.
I hope the weather is really good and we have some snow to go with this .
Oh the weather is going to be really cold today they might be some problems holding on to that foot ball.
I heard that one of the players is going to be sitting out dont know for sure which one
This is really going to make the game get tight if its a top player .
While I guess we will know in couple of hours how this is going to pan out .
Yes I am going to go out and get some snacks so I can sit right on that TV.
I think them Cowboys will put a kicking on this game .
Yes they do have a great winning team this year to go all the way .
There seems to be that there was some players that felt that they dod not get to play enough this year.
Well you do want to play your best player to stay ahead .
The palyers will be wearing the warmest thing they can this year won't they
I think they have special heaters for the team to use to stay warm when it gets really cold.
I heard one player say time it was so cold they could not tell they were hurt till after game .
Oh that would be awful could image how they felt after that game
I think I had better go get them snacks and get ready to sit down for a long game
Me to I ll talk to after the game and we will see how every thing went its going to be a great superbowl
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are they going to do about the Pro Bowl, man?
Yeah, it used to be a good game, you know?
I remember watching a few years ago and they were taking it so easy.
Yeah, it was kind of a laugh until that one play.
Yeah, I remember that, when the defensive line really went at it...
And the offensive line was just standing there getting smack.
Then they finally started to play some football. Remember?
Yeah, it was kind of funny, I thought.
I understand them not wanting to get hurt but it used to be a real game.
Yeah, you wouldn't want to blow out a knee in the Pro Bowl.
I know I wouldn't want to end my $100 million dollar career on a name that doesn't really mean anything.
It's not like the All Star game in baseball though. Nothing's riding on it.
Wonder if they could do anything about that?
First possession in the Super Bowl for the conference that wins the Pro Bowl maybe.
I guess that's something but not really much.
I bet if they paid them better even that wouldn't make a difference.
I have to agree with you there.
The Pro Bowl's kind of like preseason but your job's not on the line.
That's a good way of thinking of it. Never occurred to me.
I only just now thought of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite team?
I like the Minnesota Vikings.
Really, thats a rare one.
What do you mean?
I don't know many people who like them.
They honestly aren't they bad.
Thats not what their records say....
You know they've been to the Superbowl 4 times.
Yeah, and lost all of them.
Well, they are my favorite team.
Why?
I feel like one day they'll get it together and win a Superbowl.
Hey, anything is possible.
Yeah, my mom likes them too.
Oh, so you like to follow them together.
Yeah, exactly.
You don't like any of the Florida teams?
Not really, I mean just cause I live in Florida doesn't mean I have to like them.
Sure, but it's weird when someone doesn't.
Not weird, just not conventional.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how is it going?
Pretty good. You catch that panthers game last night?
Yea, it was great.
Cam is really coming into his own in the NFL.
He's had a few good seasons to be sure. Can't forget that super bowl performance though.
I think that was nerves more than anything else; he looked jittery.
Sure, but that's part of being a quarterback. He didn't look jittery last night.
I guess the pressure isn't as bad during regular season.
You think they will go all the way this year?
Don't know, but they looked pretty solid.
Maybe. Still looks like some problems on the offensive line.
You talking about the right tackle?
Yea ha ha, he didn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of the line.
Well he is a rookie. Can't expect him to just pick up and run with it until he has some time to practice with the team.
Sure, sure. I'm pulling for the Saints this year anyways.
The Saints? Really?
Yea. Really liked what they did last year, and they picked up some good players in the draft.
I see.
Well we better get back to work, talk to you later.
Sure, see you around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think are the greatest football players of all time?
Which position?
Any of them, but let's start with quarterback.
Well, for starters, Tom Brady might be the GOAT.
You think he is greater than Joe Montana?
I think his last superbowl definitely put him over the edge.
So who else would you put on that list?
Well, I think Montana, of course, and also players like Elway.
Elway is phenomenal.
Yes, but he doesn't have as many rings as those other guys.
Well what about Staubach and Manning?
Those guys are great - Manning got a ring on his way out.
I agree, but of course they probably don't stand up to Brady.
Brady has just been too good for too long.
Yes I agree, but stability and coaching have helped.
Yes they have - they are consistently great.
So how is Brady going to do this year, will he slow down?
Maybe a little, but he will be a force, as usual.
Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time.
Yes, I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that head trauma is a serious issue in NFL football?
Yes, but maybe overstated?
Overstated in what way?
I mean, these players know what they are getting in to.
But we only recently had the technology and understanding to be aware of these issues.
I somewhat agree. They still get millions of dollars per year.
This is true, but is it worth it if you can't walk at age 45?
That is a good point - does that take away from the game?
Yes and no - I just think we need to take more preventative measures.
Hopefully they can increase padding and teach more fundamentally sound diving.
We will see - both of those would be nice options.
Yes, it may take years, though.
I think a solution would be to obviously encourage less head-based collisions.
Agreed, but they already do that to an extent.
Yes, but perhaps not enough.
Maybe the referees could be even more strict.
Yes, that would help some.
They already do so much though!
I think the issues of head injuries will continue to plague the modern NFL.
Yes, it will - but it is beautiful nonetheless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Greenbay Packers?
Not really since Fabre retired.
I miss him.
He was the heart and soul of that team.
Rodgers is good though.
Yeah but he's missing that passion.
Only Fabre could bring that to every play.
Didn't he play with a concussion?
Multiple times.
That's insane.
He got one, went out of the game came back in threw a touchdown and then went back off the field.
He was dedicated.
I wish I could see him play one more time.
That would be nice.
Do you think Rodgers will ever be as good as him?
Maybe with enough time.
Yeah, maybe.
He's already better than we could have hoped for but not Brett Fabre.
He is a solid quarterback.
He will only get better too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
How's it going?
Good, you?
Good.  You a fan of the nfl?
Yeah sure I watch a lot of games.
Nice, what team do you like?
I'm a bengals fan.
Oh okay.
What about you?
I like the Titans.
You from Nashville?
I grew up there, but don't live there any more.
Oh I see.
What about you, you in the Cincy area?
Yeah that's where I live.
Do you have a favorite player?
I like Andy Dalton a lot.
Oh okay cool.
Nice chatting to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are you feeling about the upcoming NFL season?
Great! I'm so excited to see the Cowboys dominate again.
Are you sure they're going to be as great as they were last year?
Of course, why wouldn't they be?
Well, the Cowboys actually have a lot going against them this year in comparison to the amazing season they had last year.
Like what? I'm not sure what you're talking about.
Well, for starters, I think Dek Prescott isn't going to have nearly as good of a season as last year.
It's not like he's injured or anything. He's going to be great just like he has been.
A lot of quarterbacks regress a good deal in their second NFL season as defenses adjust to them. Remember Colin Kaepernick?
That's a fair point. But it's only speculation, and one reason at that!
Well, the Cowboys also lost a great deal of players on defense. I think 4 of the starters in the secondary left during free agency?
Oh wow. I know we had people leave in the off-season but I didn't realize it was that many.
Yeah the Cowboys corners and safetys aren't looking that great. Which is scary considering everyone in the NFC East really upgraded their receiving corps this offseason.
Cornerback is one of those positions where a star can emerge at any time. I'm sure we'll see some talent develop throughout the course of the season.
Still though, I wouldn't expect the same kind of regular season record as last year. They've also lost two of their starters from the offensive line.
That's not good. That line was one of the best in the league. Top five last year I'd say!
I agree. However, when you have young playmakers like Ekeziel Elliott sometimes you can afford to have gaps in talent at other positions.
He is so fun to watch. The Cowboys are never out of a game when he's playing!
I agree! It's going to be a great season to watch the Cowboys.
And to watch them in the Super Bowl hopefully!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Cowboys can win the Super Bowl this year?
I think it's more likely they'l win in a couple years.
Why is that?
Well I think the odds of Dak doing as good as his rookie season are low.
Yeah you see QBs have sophomore slumps a lot.
I think Zeke will be just as good this year though.
Yeah I think Elliot could have the most rushing yards in the league.
I don't know about that, don't forget about Bell.
Yeah Bell will probably have more all-purpose yards.
Yeah, but if Cowboys really rely on the run then who knows.
What about Jason WItten, is he getting too old?
Yeah, he obviously isn't the same player he used to be.
Yeah, but he is still an effective run and pass blocker.
Yeah, but he certainly can't catch well anymore.
You also got to worry about the Cowboys' defense.
Yeah, they did a good job of drafting a lot of young talent though.
Yeah but those guys are going to need time to develop.
That's what I'm saying that they need a couple more years.
Yeah hopefully they win one soon.
They need to win one while they have the extra cap room from having a low paid QB.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading about Andrew Luck and I hope he'll be able to play soon.
He had surgery right?
Yes, on his shoulder, and he still can't throw.
How long ago was his surgery?
In January so it has been awhile.
Who will the Colts use if he can't start?
Scott Tollzien. He played for Wisconsin in college, and then the 49ers and Packers.
Oh well he's had a lot of experience then.
Yes, just not as a starter. They really need Luck to get back as soon as possible.
Is he even practicing yet at camp?
No. He is just observing because he hasn't been released yet.
If he gets healthy they probably have a really good shot this year.
I think they need more than him though. They didn't have a great season last year.
They definitely need to up their defense a bit.
Especially being in the same conference as the Patriots.
Well Brady probably doesn't have many years left, but I'm sure they can find someone else.
Definitely. The Patriots are strong as a team.
They could probably do well with any quarterback.
I'm sure they could with the offense and defense that they have.
I would like to see a new champion this year though. The same winners get boring after awhile.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the league has its hand on the domestic violence issue?
Yes I do I think it broke with Ray Rice
Like that was the low point?
I think after that they really buckled down
It still happens though
Yes but not at the rate that it was going at
This is true, what about Hardy?
What about him?
Do you think that really changed the league
I mean he got a year and then came back and was trash
Would he still be good if he was around today?
No I dont think he would be around.
So he was a flash in the pan player?
Yes otherwise we would see success still
Why hasnt anyone signed Rice?
He was a running back so its hard to get jobs even when you dont miss a year
I dont think he was over the hill
He definitely wasnt.  But he plays a tough position
One that is easy to fill as well
He probably learned from his mistakes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best running back in the NFL?
Adrian Peterson!
This isn't 2012, man. AP is pretty old.
True.
How about Ezekiel Elliot?
He had a great rookie season last year.
Yeah, he was electric.
I'd be a little nervous about saying a 2nd year player is the best in the league, though.
The position is a young man's position, though.
I agree with that. But what about the Cowboys' offensive line?
True, they are really good.
It makes a lot of players look good, running behind a line like that.
So if not Elliot, then who?
What about Jordan Howard?
Of the Bears?
Yeah. Another second year player.
He was a nice surprise, but I think Elliot is the clearly superior talent.
Jordan Howard had nothing going for him, though. The Bears offense was basically just him.
He was pretty much their only weapon, true.
I give a player a lot of credit for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you know about the Super Bowl?
I don't really know that much. You?
I know it started in the 1960s.
Yes, the first one was in 1967.
Who played in that game?
It was the Kansas City Chiefs and the Green Bay Packers.
Who won?
The Packers won that game by a large margin.
I see.
They are a pretty famous team.
Yes, they have been good for a long time.
How many Super Bowls have they won?
They have won 4 rings.
Wow, that's pretty impressive.
Yes, but they also have won 9 championships.
What do you mean?
Well, there were championship games played before the Super Bowl era.
I understand. So, in total, they have thirteen?
Yes, that's correct.
I would say they have created a culture of winning in Green Bay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the upcoming season! The Pats have a scrimmage in just about two weeks.
I think it is against the Saints.
True, just like the previous three years. Bill is great friend with Sean Payton, the New Orleans coach.
It will be odd to Saint;s fans to see Brandin Cooks in the opponent uniform so soon.
Well, it was almost a straight up trade, Cooks for Pats CB Butler.
I am relieved that it turned out that the trade did not go down that way.
Me too! I am glad we kept both. We gave them a 1st round draft choice instead, a veritable steal.
Cooks is just 23. It is akin to drafting him very late in the 1st round, a can't miss proposition!
He will be even better with Brady than the Saints QB, Drew Brees.
Cooks is a proven commodity.The only risk for the Pats is injury.
That is a fact of life in the NFL.But, if he stays healthy, I see 15 touchdown catches.
Agreed! And, it would be more on another team. Brady always looks for and finds the open guy.
Brees is a great quarterback in his own right. He was doubted out of Iowa when he arrived in the NFL because of his short stature.
He is not the photo-typical QB as fare as height goes..he is barely 5'11".
He shut up the naysayers with a Super Bowl victory. He might have more with a decent defense, which he has rarely enjoyed.
It seems like the Saints have always been offense-minded. That will not work in today's NFL.
I don't think it would work in any day's NFL. Defense usually wins out!
True, there have been many teams with mediocre offenses that have won Super Bowls. I can name the Redskins, Ravens, and Giants off the top of my head.
How about the Bears of 1986? Well, I guess their offense was good, but it paled in comparison to their defense.
I can't wait.Maybe we'll talk again tomorrow!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't it insane to think that the Miami Dolphins went undefeated?
When did they do that?
In 1972.
Well, the Patriots did that in 2007.
Yeah but the Patriots lost the Super Bowl that year. The Dolphins won the Super Bowl.
So that has only happened once in the NFL?
Yeah. It is an amazing feat to think about.
Even if the Dolphins are the only team that has ever done that. They have only gone downhill ever since.
That's not true. We repeated and won the Super Bowl again the next year in 1973.
Yes but I mean that the last 30 plus years of Dolphins history has been pretty lousy since that streak.
We won the AFC in 1984.
Is that when you had Dan Marino?
Yeah. He was MVP that year.
Who beat them in the Super Bowl that year?
It was the Buffalo Bills. They didn't even deserve to be in the Super Bowl but they somehow beat the Dolphins.
Well what are they going to be like this year?
There is some hope for them this year. They made the playoffs last year and the new coach started to show some good signs.
Who is their new coach?
It is Adam Gase. He started last year.
Oh ok. Well hopefully they will make a comeback this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the nicest player in the NFL?
I've heard that Russell Wilson is pretty good with fans, especially young ones
I've seen him on the news visiting children's hospitals in Seattle
A lot of players do that, like Andy Dalton in Cincinnati with his wife, if I remember right
Speaking of players and their wives, I see a lot about Eli Manning and his wife making pretty sizeable donations
Donating money is great, of course, but seeing players out there volunteering is pretty awesome
One of my favorite NFL videos that isn't game-related is seeing J. J. Watt passing the ball back and forth with young fans before a game
J. J. Watt seems like a pretty cool guy, considering he's huge and those pictures of him covered in blood are kind of terrifying
He's just a big teddy bear who loves the game and loves life
When players are enjoying themselves, it makes them a lot more fun to watch
Definitely, like Odell Beckham Jr. when he's in a good mood
Kirk Cousins has that video where he's yelling, "You like that!" and now it's like his catchphrase
Cousins is pretty popular as a nice guy and all around good player
Do you think they'll trade him to the 49ers like the rumors have been saying?
I don't know, but I hope that they do so he brings some of that positivity to San Francisco
It does seem like the team has been down in the dumps for a while, what with the lousy records and all their players leaving or retiring
They have a pretty nice guy too in Joe Staley; he's a character
You don't really see offensive linemen being super popular like that, so it's a nice change of pace
Or fullbacks like John Kuhn, who I think should have been kept in Green Bay
That's the NFL for you, though, and the Saints are another team that could do with some uplifting
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I heard that you're a bit of a trivia buff.
I am!
What's your best subject?
I'm pretty good at knowing things about the NFL.
That's cool. What's your favorite fact?
Well, the Green Bay Packers won the first ever Super Bowl.
Oh, wow, I didn't know that! What year was that in?
It was in 1967.
Hey, my mom was born that year.
Cool.
Do you have a second favorite fact?
How about this; in '96, the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore to become the Baltimore Ravens.
That's pretty interesting. I actually know a similar fact.
What's that?
In '84 the Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis and became the Indianapolis Colts.
Yup!
Well, I think it's neat that you know so much about NFL stuff.
I don't know that much, just random facts, really.
It's still pretty neat.
Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can I be honest for a second?
Sure, honesty always appreciated.
I really don't know that much about the NFL.
What do you mean?
Like, I don't even know what it stands for.
Oh honey, well I can probably answer any questions you have, I love football.
Okay.....so what does it stand for?
National Football League.
How many teams are there in the NFL>
I think 32, but I don't wanna say for sure.
Wow, I thought there would be more!
Really, anymore and it would be too much!
I don't know, I just thought there was a lot more than that.
Well, there is college football and such which brings the count much higher.
Gotcha, and these teams just all play against each other every year?
Sort of, basically they are split into two areas and fight between the two brackets.
Gotcha, and whoever wins the first bracket and the second bracket face off.
Yes, which is the Superbowl!
Gotcha, makes sense.
Any other questions?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about football
Sounds great
Do you watch nfl?
All the time
Same here
I like the miami dolphins
They are pretty good
Who do you like?
The jets
Were both on the east coast
Yup exactly
They did good this year
Yes they did
I cant wait til next year
Me either
Nice talking to you
You too
Thanks
Bye
Bye
XXXXXXXXXXX
This game is a shoe-in.
Don't say that, man.
It is!
My team is behind, but we'll catch up soon!
You guys are done!
We're the Eagles! We fly!
Then fly to that touchdown.
Oh, we will.
I'm sure.
Give it one more quarter!
You need that?
You guys are up by 5, so yes.
Did you bet on this game?
I sure did!
You might wanna recoup your bet.
Really?
Not looking good for you.
Alright.  Let's get Tommy on the field.
He can't save y'all!
Oh the pessimism.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are the mascots of the teams in the NFL?
There are many since there are thirty-two teams. My favorite is the Redskins.
What NFL team do they belong to?
They are the Washington Redskins.
What city are they located in?
They are based in Washington D.C.
I was thinking the state of Washington. Didn't I hear about a court case involving this team?
Yes, there was a case about the trademark and use of the word "Redskins".
The court outcome was in favor of the "Redskin" name.
That is good since other NFL team mascots could have been affected in the future.
How many NFL teams have animal mascots?
Twenty teams have animal mascots in the NFL.
Does that mean the other twelve teams have human mascots?
No, seven of the twelve have human mascots and the remaining five have no official mascot at all.
What are some of the different animals used as mascots in the NFL?
There is a raven, a tiger, and a horse for a few examples.
What other animal mascots are in the NFL?
There is a bull, a jaguar, a raccoon, and a dolphin.
I know the dolphin is the mascot of the Miami team, but who has the raccoon?
The Tennessee Titans have a raccoon as a mascot. It is called T-Rac.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Another lame football season.
Yea, I miss the days when my team was relevant.
It's tough being a Redskins fan.
Yea, our team sucks.
I miss the days of Riggins.
Joe Theisman was great.
That injury he had was horrific.
Ugliest injury I ever saw on tv.
It's up there with Sid Vicious the wrestler.
Norv Turner ruined this francise.
Remember the 91 season?
Yea, that was perfect.
Superbowl was a cakewalk.
How bout the NFC Championship?
Ha, had to play the mighty Lions who we'd beaten 45-0 already.
How did we squeak by that one?
And they fumble right out the gate!
Those were the days.
It won't be that way this year.
Yea, gonna be a long year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch a lot of NFL games?
Yes, I love the NFL. The Carolina Panthers are my favorite team.
My favorite team the Dallas Cowboys.
I started liking the Panthers the second they move to North Carolina. That is my home state.
I grew up a Dallas fan because my father was the one.
My second favorite team are the Colts because my wife is from Indianapolis
I also pool for the Atlanta Falcons. I lived in Atlanta for a few years.
Do you ever go see the games in person?
I've been to a handful over the last few years. I love seeing football live.
I haven't been to any this year but last year I got to go to Panthers games.
How was the Panther stadium?
It's really nice. When you see it in person it's just so massive.
I know what you mean, the AT&T Center is ridiculous.
It just gets so expensive I watch most of the games on TV.
Me too, I watch at least four games a week.
Besides specific teams are certain players my pool for two
Oh cool, who are some your favorite players?
Apple for Philip Rivers and Russell Wilson because they both went to NCSU.  That's where I went.
I don't really have any favorite players and just my cowboys and Falcons.
Well I hope my Panthers have a great season. Good luck to your Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will get the Heisman trophy this year?
That's a tough call.
Yeah, sure is.
I bet that Watson and Jackson are in the running.
They are two amazing players.
Yep, they are on their way to the NFL.
You're not kidding.
I'm so impressed by their talent.
Me too.
They must have been born with a football.
I know.
How do you think they got so so good?
Hard work and dedication.
Talent too.
They have to be the very best.
Years and years of practice.
Lots of mentoring as well.
It must be an interesting ride.
To be in the spotlight would be challenging and exciting.
You have to handle stress well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Atlanta Falcons
What about them?
11 and 5 last season, looks like they could do better this year.
You think?
Yeah, looks like the same team and coaches and a similar season layout this year.
Well, could be. Do you think they could take on New England?
Well, that's a heafty goal. New England is a Dynasty.
Yes but they can be beaten.
That's what Dallas and Oakland thought last year.
Haha, true.
Well, lets see how Atlanta does in Pre-Season.
Yeah, i think they can iron out the kinks in Pre-Season
I wouldnt worry too much about Dallas this season, they are in disarray.
Oakland isn't doing much better.
I can see Arizona doing some damage, They were unusually good last season.
Yeah, that was a shocker.
Well, Atlanta it looking real good.
I agree, can't wait for football season to start!
Me too, i'm already getting geared up.
So am i!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited about the new NFL season how about you?
Yes me too I always like to watch the games.
Me too that is like what me and wife do on Sundays is watch the games together!
Who is your favorite team?
I am a homer love the Arizona Cardinals.
Do you think they will do well this year?
Yes they should given the talent level on the team.
Last year was  disappointing for them.
Yes especially given the precious year they went to the NFC championship game and lost to the Panthers.
They need new players Palmer and Fitzgerald are getting old don't you think?
Maybe a little but they are still one of the best Quarterback and receiver duos in the NFL.
Plus Fitzgerald is just an all around great guy donating to charity his money and time to kids in the community.
Yes that is true too but they also have some new recruits with great potential.
Like who?
Haason Reddick to name one. Drafted 13th over all in the 2017 draft.
What position does he play?
Linebacker and he is a good one and that is where Arizona needed some improvement is on defense.
Where did he play college football?
Temple where he had an outstanding record.
I agree then he should be a good addition to the team and help them back in form to win the NFC Championship and hopefully all the way to the Super Bowl!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you like American football?
I love it! I am a big fan.
So do you have a favorite team in the NFL?
My favorite team is the Cleveland Browns.
What? Are you being serious or are you just joking around?
I am totally serious.
Wow. Ok. I did not mean to be rude, it is just that I have seen the videos.
What videos.
You know, the ones of the Browns fans tearing off their jerseys in the stands or staring off into space in disbelief as yet another game is lost.
I think they are an exciting team.
Ok.  And that is good. That is part of what makes watching football fun.  Every year is a new beginning.
This was a good year for us.
How do you figure?
Well, usually we win just enough games to ruin our draft picks. This year we didn't do that.
Well, I have to admit, you did get a lot of good draft picks.
I think it is really going to help us be competitive.
You are probably right, might really take hold in a few years.
Seriously, losing fifteen games was the best thing we could have done this year. We weren't going to win in the playoffs anyway and what does 8-8 do for us? Nothing.  We had a really good year.
If you say so, I mean you are the Browns fan, so you would know.
You got that right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you consider America's football team?
Everyone says it's the patriots..
They used to say the Cowboys.
Yes, they did. Maybe in the nineties.
There were some good players back then.
There was.
Trpy Aikman was everyones favorite.
Yeah, he was okay.
I liked Deion Sanders better.
Me too.
Not a fan of the team though. They're rivals.
I remember the one New Years Day game when it snowed.
That was a terrible game.
Yes, your brother loved the Cowboys and you didn't.
That was a rough day to watch football.
I could imagine.
Emmitt Smith was a great player.
Yes, he was an MVP in the one SuperBowl.
I didn't know that.
If I'm not mistaken it was Superbowl XXVIII
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe there is only about a month and half before the NFL season begins.
It is getting closer.  Training camps are soon.
Is it the Cowboys that got Oxnard, California.
Yes they do and they have a brand new practice facility.
Well Jerry Jones is a showmen so I'm sure there are reasons.
You know it's all about the money!
Did the Redskins ever sing Kirk Cousins?
You know I'm not sure.
Last that I heard they were going to give him another franchise tag.
That's interesting.  I wander how many times they can do that?
It sucks that it's not a long term deal, but he gets paids a lot!
I can't figure him out he is kind of up and down.
He reminds me of Tony Romo.
Good comparison.  They are both kind of hit or miss.
Are they playing games in London again?
I believe so.  Jacksonsville somehow always gets stuck playing over there.
It seem like it would be cool for the fans, but not so much for the players.
Yes if your team was going to play there you could plan a nice trip around that game.
Let's get together on Sundays and watch some NFL football.
For sure I would.  I would enjoy that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you think will win the Super Bowl this upcoming season?
I think the Raiders have a good shot. The Cowboys are up and coming as well.
What do you think about the Raiders bringing Marshawn Lynch out of retirement to play for them?
I am actually really excited to see how he does after some time off. I hope he is as good as ever.
The Raiders could really use a power back to compliment their high flying offense.
I agree. Did you see the monster deal the Raiders just signed with Derek Carr?
Yeah, wasn't it like 5 years for 125 million dollars?
Yeah, because of that deal he is currently the highest paid player in the NFL.
Did the Raiders just sign another player to a huge contract too?
Are you talking about Gabe Jackson? They signed him for a 5 year 56 million dollar contract.
Yeah, that's really good for a guard though. I think he's like the third highest paid guard in he league now behind Raider's Osemele and the Brown's guard.
Yeah, true. Do you think the raiders are going to run out of cap space and not be able to seal the deal on bigger names such as Khalil Mack?
I think that claim is really off mark. Derek Carr worked with the office to make sure there would be enough money left on the table for the Raiders to do deals with all the players they had planned to negotiate with this season.
I suppose they still have 37 million dollars in cap space and they could restructure a few contracts if they wanted to make more cap space for Mack.
I think if they wanted to sign a new contract with Khalil Mack this season they would have by now. I think they are planning on waiting until next year.
Yeah, I mean he is signed through 2018 and he isn't entering a contract year like the other two major players they just negotiated with.
Do you really think its fair to Mack though? Considering he is is probably the best player on their team.
Yeah, Carr gets all the attention because he's the quarterback, but I agree Mack is the best player on that team and deserves to be paid like it.
It kind of seems like the Raiders are making bad excuses not to pay him what he deserves.
Plus he has to risk injury one more year waiting to get paid to his caliber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think's gonna win the next Super Bowl?
Not sure, it's pretty tough to tell.
Well, what do you think?
I say the Jaguars, or the Lions.
Why them? They're never gonna win.
Never say never, man! I think they got a chance!
As long as any of those good QB's are still around, those teams are gonna win.
Oh, okay.
Makes sense, right?
Yes, it does.
Let's talk about favorite foods at the games, though.
Like what?
Hamburgers and Tacos!
What? When did tacos become such a popular food?
They're usually popular around soccer games, but it spreaded to football, too!
........
Never mind.
I think hot dogs are still better food than tacos.
What about corn dogs?
That sounds great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am really excited about the 2017 NFL season. Are you?
Yes, I am excited, especially due to the wild finish from the 2016 season superbowl.
Speaking of the superbowl, which two teams do you think will be in the 2017 Superbowl game?
I think Baltimore Ravens and Atlant Falcons.
I can understand Atlanta getting into the superbowl for the second year in a row, but Ba;timore might be a stretch.
I believ that Baltimore is the only team in the AFC that can beat the New England Patriots.
Your correct. There aren't many teams in the AFC that can beat New England.
Baltimore has a history of playing New England tough.
I agree with you. Baltimore is one of the only teams that play New England competitively. I believe the Patriots will go back to the superbowl.
I expect Baltimore to bounce back strong this year, and I don't see New England in the superbowl for a secon year in a row.
On the NFC side, I, I think Matt Ryan can play well again this year. I expect to see the falcons in the Superbowl.
I like the Packers for the superbowl.
Aaron has a pechant for losing tough playoff games.
Yeah, but I expect the Pakers to find a way to win.
The game shoulfd be interesting.
II aleays look forward to NFC games.
I look forward to all football games.
I do too.
I love football
I love football too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Do you know when the next NFL game will be?
Which one do you mean?
There's many NFL games in the upcoming season.
I'm referring to the first game of the season.
Oh, you mean the one with San Diego Chargers.
Yes indeed! That's my favorite team actually.
Oh really? I don't like the Chargers.
Really? Why not the Chargers.
The players in the Chargers don't play well.
Well I'm from San Diego so I support my local team.
I'm from Chicago so obviously I don't support your local team.
I don't have any rival teams though.
The next game will be on the 15th then.
Oh what time?
The NFL game starts at 7 p.m.
Game on! I'm gonna drink a beer every time the Chargers score.
Great idea! Beer and NFL go together.
I love NFL tailgate parties
NFL tailgates are the best
Tailgating is the best experience in my college frat! Go Chargers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Joe Theisman?
Was he a QB?
Yes
For which team?
The Washington Redskins
Oh, I don't really remember him
Do you remember Lawrence Taylor?
Oh sure, LB for the Giants
Yes, well he's the one that destroyed Joe Theisman's leg
Oh that's right. On MNF.
Yes, that's the one.
Oh that was brutal.
Yes, very hard to watch the replay.
Did he ever play again?
I don't remember for sure, if he did it wasn't long.
Yeah, hard to come back from a hit like that
I heard LT was actually pretty upset about it.
I could imagine.
Yeah, football can brutal.
Yes, definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first start watching football?
All my life.
Which team did your parents root for?
They were Washington fans when I was young
Who are they fans of now?
They switched to the Panthers when we moved
Did they get in on the ground floor?
Yep. Fans since 1995.
I always rooted for the Saints
Were you around for Archie Manning?
I was. I remember the paper bags.
I can't believe two of his sons now quarterback in the NFL
It's amazing right?
I like Eli better I have to say
He's not as good of a quarterback.
No. But he seems like a better person
I'll give you that.
I don't like Bellichick either
Yeah he's dodgy as a coach
That's why the Patriots always win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The start of the NFL season is only about 2 months away now.
I know it's crazy. I feel like the Patriots were just beating the Falcons in the Superbowl.
Yeah, don't remind me. I'm still upset about them beating the Steelers last year in the AFC championship game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Vikings to be a sleeper team this year.
Really? With Sam Bradford as their QB?
Bradford is a solid QB. Their line didn't play the best last year.
True, I like the addition of Reif.  He adds a dimension of toughness.
Besides Patterson, they didn't lose any players to free agency.
What are you talking about? They lost the greatest running back of all-time - Adrian Peterson.
I agree that he WAS a great player.  He's been injured lately and is at the end of his career.
Don't count AP out, I bet he runs for 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns in New Orleans this year.
He's washed up and will be out of the league in two years.
I think he holds on and breaks the rushing record in five years.
Besides, the Vikes drafted Delvin Cook to replace AP.
Cook is decent, but do you think he will be any good in the NFL.
I think he wins the rookie of the year, has 1,500 combined yards and 10 tds.
Pretty high expectations for a rookie running back!
I also, love the Vikings defense, one of the best in the league.
They didn't play that great at the end of the year last year.
They were on the field a lot, so they were tired.
So your'e saying that the Vikes will be better on offense and their defense returns to form?
Exactly
I could see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I think it is a terrible sport!
Oh?
Yes!  Overgrown men slamming into each other getting injuries
Oh it's not THAT dangerous
Actually it's super dangerous
How so?
As I told you - lots of injurie
I guess?
Like concussions
There are quite a few of those
Yea, it's horrible!
I wouldn't limit it just because of injuries though...
Oh, but can't they play nice?
It wouldnt be football then
Well My son will never play!
That sucks for him!
...
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXV.
Who played in that one?
The Buffalo Bills against the New York Giants.
Oh, "wide right".
Yes, a heartbreaker for Bills fans.
Where was it played?
Tampa Stadium.
Who were the broadcasters?
Al Michaels, Frank Gifford, and Dan Dierdorf.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Jim Kelly for the Bills and Jeff Hostetler for the Giants.
Who were the coaches?
Marv Levy for Buffalo and Bill Parcells for the Giants.
What the score at the end of the first quarter?
3-3 tie.
And the half?
12-7, Bills.
I know what happens in the end.
Wide right, Scott Norwood.
The Bills never recovered.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to love Deadspins why your team sucks articles
Yeah, they are pretty funny
He was so harsh with the panthers last year.
Well it all turned out to be true
Yes, they had a terrible record in 2016
I can't wait for the new ones to come out
I think the Patriots are going to dominate again this year
Unfortunately I agree even though I hate them
I wish Aaron Rogers and the packers would do better
I know or the bears would figure out their QB
Anybody will be better than Jay Cuter
All he throws are interceptions
I think Wayne Gallman is a great new running back
Who drafted him?
The New York Giants
I hate payton manning, but I don't mind Eli
Yeah Payton is a bad person
I hate that he is the better QB
Did Eli ever win a superbowl?
I'm not sure about that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well, another football season is a few weeks away.
Go Browns!!
Wow, did you get season tickets again?
Of course.  Every year for 10 years.
I haven't been to a Browns game for a long time.  But I do watch the games.
What are some of your best memories?
Monday night football games at Municipal Stadium.  I lik
Did you go to any playoff games?
I saw Cleveland and Baltimore in the playoffs.  Johnny Unitas  was the quarterback!
That was a long while ago.
I miss the Browns from the late 1980's.  They were great.
Under Scottenheimer.
They got within one game of the Super Bowl!
Those playoff games were exciting.
Especially the Jets game.
Double overtime.  So exciting.
So many good memories of great games.
I know.  I just wish the Browns could be in the playoffs again.
Someday.
Someday.  Someday soon, I hope!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you interested in football at all?
Kind of, why?
What team do you root for?
Patriots, for sure. You?
Patriots, obviously! We are in New England.
What do you think of Brady?
He's the GOAT!
For sure!
I know he said he's not going to retire anytime soon but...
but what?
He's old!
He is, but he's so skilled! There's no need for him to retire anytime soon.
Yeah, true.
Did you watch the super bowl this year?
Yeah, it was amazing!
That alone is sign that Brady shouldn't retire anytime soon.
Yeah, you're right!
I'm not even a huge NFL fan, but Brady is amazing!
Do you have one of his jerseys?
No, but I definitely need one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So man, you hear they are talking of doing guaranteed contracts in the NFL?
I don't see that ever working out, it doesn't make sense.
Well, I mean I'm sure it would lead to shorter contracts, like two or three years each.
Right now it's only the first 20 or so player that get their full contract pay guaranteed at the draft, right?
Yeah, then the others have to negotiate how much of their contract is or not, like how many years.
Yeah but if everyone had shorter contracts, plus guaranteed pay, people would be moving around all the time. Teams would change a lot.
But maybe not, this would make the teams give better deals, and treat the whole team better, and as more of a whole, I think.
I don't know, maybe it's better for the players, but not the teams or the fans. Just when you like a team, the whole thing will change.
We already deal with a lot of change in the teams, fans are loyal to their team, not their player.
Not all the time, a lot of fans stick to one player, and if they are routing for a new team every few years, may take some of the fun out of it for them.
I see what you are saying, and maybe it would be out of wack for a few years, but it would work out and balance in the end.
I still don't agree, but what are the chances this is even going to happen?
I don't know, it would probably have to take one team doing it, then all players wanting to go to them, for others to follow suit.
So no one has done it yet?
Not really, but Dolphins defensive Suh does have a fully guaranteed 3 year plus rolling guarantees for 18-20 so it's close.
But still, the "rolling" part gives the team a little control there, I don't see them giving that control up.
You might be right, but I'd still like to see it happen. The players make the game and this is the best deal for them.
Maybe, but if it makes fans back away, it hurts everyone so I don't know man.
Well, the next few seasons should be interesting, I bet at least things change a bit.
They change a bit every year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Billy how about the Bears
The Bears are awful this year
yeah they are lol
I would rather watch the Cleveland Browns
Seriously man they are crappy every day
I know, they have a revolving door of players
especially quarterbacks
yeah pretty much 3 per year
Remember the most recent one
Who Manziel?
yeah that clown
Johnny Football ended up being a bust
for sure the guy was like 5 foot tall what did they expect
He cannot even see over top of my mom
Ha Ha right and what does he weight 5 pounds soaking weight
like a drowned rat
Oh well maybe they will find a decent quarterback eventually
they probably need to find a good coach first
yeah it def starts from the top
they could learn from the Patriots
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose your favorite NFL player?
Well I really like Tom Brady, I think hes a great quarterback.
Are you a Patriots fan?
I actually am, I consider myself a fan of the team.
Really? how long have you liked them?
Well its been a while I remember always rooting for them but I became a real fan in the last superbowl.
And why is that?
I think that the comeback was pretty epic and also inspiring.
Yeah it was a great comeback, I thought Patriots were lost already.
It was pretty hard to recover from that, so whose your favorite player?
I really like Matt Ryan I think he has a lot of potential.
Oh and what team does he play for?
Hes the QB for the Falcons.
Are you a Falcon´s fan?
Not really I just like the player.
And what is your favorite team?
I really like the Raiders.
Oh that team is cool as well, though they havent had luck lately.
Yeah I know they used to be a great team but times change.
I know, they  used to be pretty good but hopefully those days will return.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi
Cool what's good
Nothing much
Oh yeah?
Yeah
Wanna chill
We can
What day is it
Like what
The day of the week
Sunday
Yeah we can watch NFL games
Sounds cool
So coming
Yep for sure
Hooray
Whose playing
It's the all star game
Perfect
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch last year's Super Bowl?
Of course I did. I watch every year, but especially if the Patriots are in it.
Oh then you must have loved this game.
Well, not all of it. The first half and most of the third quarter were a bit frustrating.
I don't think I've ever seen a game like that.
I don't think anyone has. To come back from 25 down in the regular season is nearly impossible, but in the Super Bowl?!
Unheard of until this year.
That's true. I think ten points down was the biggest comeback.
They even did it all without Gronkowski.
They had to. I hope he's healthy this year, and I'm excited that James White is coming back.
Yeah, I think the Pats will see a lot more of him.
I completely agree. They also added some excellent free agents and drafted pretty well too.
Belichick always has a way of turning nobodies in to sombodies.
Very true. I mean, Brady was the 199th pick.
Isn't that amazing?
They just have a way of getting these underrated guys and turning them into machines.
I wonder what would've happened if Christian Hackenberg went there.
I think it would've been pointless for him. With Garappolo and Jacoby behind Brady, there's just no need for someone so unproven.
That's true. It probably wouldn't have been a fit for anyone.
No. But then again, if you can learn from Brady wouldn't you take the opportunity?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you like to see win a Super Bowl?
It would be nice if the Bengals or Panthers would win.
That's interesting - I would not have pegged your for a fan of either team!
Well, I always root for the underdog - I like both teams.  I live in North Carolina now and I grew up in Cinncinati, Ohio.
What would be your favorite Super Bowl matchup?
I think the Panthers versus the Patriots would make a great game again.
Yeah, you're right, good pairing of quarterbacks.  That would be a cool rematch to watch.
Have you ever been to a Super Bowl?
Yeah, my company got some tickets to Super Bowl XXXVIII, hence my interest in Pats vs. Panthers.
Where did you have seats at Super Bowl XXXVIII?
We were right on the 50 yard line - I only wish the Panthers had won!
Maybe they will at some point - Cam Newton could do it!
Do you have season tickets to Panthers games?
I don't, but I occasionally purchase tickets from a friend of mine if he isn't going - I usually go to around four games a year.
That's awesome - great stadium too.
Indeed it is - I really enjoy games there - the hot dogs too!
Do you have a subscription and ever watch NFL gamepass?
Absolutely - that way I can pick and choose what to watch on game days - very versatile.
I might think about getting that - I enjoy the NFL enough that it might be worth it.
Yeah, I think NFL gamepass is definitely worth it - almost as good as being there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I just heard that Sammy met Peyton Manning the other day. Have you ever met any NFL players?
I lived in Dallas, Texas for about 10 years, so I ran into a few of the Cowboys players from time to time.
Tell me about some of them.
Well, to begin with there was Roger Staubach.
You met him in Dallas? I thought he retired a long time ago.
He retired, but he still lives in the Dallas area.
So how did you meet him?
Actually, it was a bit of a fluke. My friend and I were at lunch one day in the town of Addison and we passed Roger on the street.
What was he doing?
Roger Staubach has a big real estate presence north of Dallas, which is where Addison is located. He was visiting one of his properties and nearly ran into us while walking on the sidewalk.
Did you say anything to him?
Not much, we just both looked at each other, realized who it was, and said 'Hello' to him.
Who else did you meet in Dallas?
Well, there was this one time when we had lunch in the same restaurant as Troy Aikman. He was sitting at the table across the aisle from us.
He was just sitting there in the middle of a restaurant?
Yes he was. It was a P. F. Chang's and he was eating lunch with someone who was an obvious business partner or attorney.
Did you say anything to Troy?
Again, we didn't say much. I don't like to bother celebrities because I understand they are just people like I am.
Ok, so you didn't say much. But what did you say?
Once again, I was with the same friend. We just looked across the aisle and he looked back at us and we all just said "Hi."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! What is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Chicago Bears.
How long have you been a Bears fan?
My whole life. My entire family loves the Bears.
They haven't played good in a long time. That must be painful to watch.
Yea, it has been. What team are you a fan of?
I am a Lions fan. They also have been terrible for many years.
Yea, they have been even worse than the Bears.
They haven't won a Super Bowl since 1957.
Wow, that is a long time. I can't believe you are still a fan.
I still love them and support the team.
Do you go to games a lot?
I try to go to one game a year at least.
Me too. I love going to the Bears games. They are so much fun.
We should go to a game together.
We can try and find a game where the Bears are playing against the Lions!
Yes! That would be fun.
Hopefully my Bears beat your Lions!
Haha, we will see! I will look for tickets this week.
Sounds good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you looking forward to the NFL season!
Absolutely! Let's see if the Pats can repeat.
I don't think they can. My money's on the Bucs this year.
The Bucs!?
Yeah, the Bucs, I think Mike Evans is going to have a big year.
Yeah, plus they picked up Desean Jackson.
See, They've got a lot of talent!
At receiver maybe...
And quarterback.. Winston is coming into his own
Yeah, but he's not even in the top five quarterbacks in the NFL.
Who's better besides Brady?
Well, Rogers, Matt Ryan, Big Ben, Russel Wilson, just to name a few.
I take issue with Matt Ryan.
Why's that?
The Bucs usually beat the Falcons.
That's true, I think they beat them twice last year.
Who do you think will win it all this year?
I don't know, maybe the Steelers.
Why the Steelers?
I think Rothlesburger wants to retire and go out on a bang.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Know what I think is hilarious?
Kids ruining dinners at fancy restaurants?
Besides that. Think NFL and big money.
I give up. This is going nowhere.
Guaranteed contracts and signing bonuses.
Why?
Well, let me be more specific: when a team gives a new player $50 million contract with a $10 million signing bonus, then to have them be a du.
New players? Do you mean rookies or free agents.
Rookies.
Why are you rooting against them?
I'm not, really. I'm rooting against the system.
How so?
I think it's absolutely ridiculous to give a player who's only succeeded against 18-22 year olds a massive contract to play against  seasoned veterans.
Yeah, bigger and stronger, right?
More-so wiser than anything.
Yeah, they've seen it all, right?
Yup. So, the system needs to change.
But you're now rooting for the team to fail, which hurts the city it's in.
That's true, but it's just sports. Cities get alone fine without them.
That's probably true. Hundreds of cities don't have sports and they're fine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't there some NFL games coming up?
Oh yeah, that's right! Can't wait!
I thought you were a soccer fan.
A little bit. Those 1-1 games are hard to watch, though.
Even a 6-5 baseball game can't compare to a football game.
I remember this 51-48 game on Monday night once.
Right! Green Bay and Dallas or something.
That's entertainment.
Even a bad football game has a lot of action compared to other sports.
You're getting me all excited! I wish there was a game on right now.
Maybe Minnesota or Chicago.
That Sam Bradford was a mistake. Teddy Bridgewater did better.
He is a little short for an NFL quarterback.
I'll bet they wish they had Warren Moon back.
Anybody can play quarterback now. All you have to do is throw the ball up in the air for these giant recievers to catch.
There's more to it than that.
Our recievers are pretty good.
Well, we don't have Calvin anymore.
Yeah, Megatron. I don't know how we got him.
He quit too soon. He must have been hurt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the NFL season to start?
Yes, I'm interested to see what happens.
What team do you want to watch the most?
I want to watch the Rams
Are you a big Rams fan?
No, I want to watch them lose.
Why do you want to watch them lose?
The ownership is a pathetic excuse for existence.
Why do you think that?
They left a city in LA for St. Louis, signed a deal that would allow them to leave, and then fleeced St. Louis for the stadium costs.
Well, wasn't that a business decision"
Yes, it was and it left the city of St. Louis with the cost of a stadium.
True, but now LA has their team back.
Yes, and they are terrible.
Well, they could get better.
I don't think they can, the ownership and management is pathetic.
Why do you say that?
They don't know anything about football, they just bleed their cities for money.
That is too bad.
It is terrible, I don't dislike the players, but that ownership should lose a bunch of money of the team continues to perform poorly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Training camps are starting for NFL football soon.  I'm already getting excited!
Me, too.  I can't wait to keep watching the Browns lose this year.
You're still a Browns fan?  That's nice of you.
I know, I  know.  I think they made some good draft picks this year.  Finally.
Don't you say that every year?  Who did they get, again?
Myles Garrett and Jabrill Peppers.
Those are good picks.  If they use them correctly.  Which they never seem to do.
This is true. Hopefully they'll make good decisions when it comes to quarterbacks this year.
Who do you think will start this season?
Good question.  They have four choices.  I read they're going to give them all an opportunity to show off and then go from there.
They drafted a quarterback this year didn't they?
Yes.  DeShone Kizer in the second round.
Not bad.  Who else do they have to chose from?
Cody Kessler, Brock Ossweiler, and Kevin Hogan.
The Browns are always lousy with quarterbacks.
True. That's why I think Myles Garrett was a great use of their first draft pick.
How about RG III?  Is he still there?
He is.  I think they just need to make better use of him.
It seems like every year is a rebuilding year for the Browns.
Maybe so.  But hey, if we win two games this year, it will be an improvement!
XXXXXXXXXXX
A good ground game is still critical. Just not in vogue.
Don't know...look at the Patriots and the Falcons. Both teams have fantastic ground games.
Not everyone is Zeke and not everyone has Cowboys O-line, though
We'll see in four or five years if he is still around
The shelf lives of RB's may have gone down, but Zeke has shown backs can still do more.
Just because Zeke was an exception to the rule doesn't mean the rule still isn't true.
What do you mean?
Gurley went in the top 10 the year before and that was too high.
Ok...that's only one
Trent Richardson went in the top 3 in 2012 and that's just downright laughable now.
Forgot about him...
I didn't...
Lol. Good one
Everything goes in cycles..... running backs fell out of favor over the past decade.
But Zeke is special player.  Yes, he has benefited for excellent line play, but if you don't take advantage of your opportunities you don't become special.
He is a special player though
Yup...he the only reason I watch Dallas play.
True. And I hate Dallas
Tell them how you really feel man!
HAHAHAHAHA Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, will you be watching and NFL games this season?
Yeah, you know it. Who do you think is going to the superbowl this year?
I think Pittsburgh steelers have a good chance.
They sure do, they have a good team, and I like them.
Who do you think is the best player on the team?
There is a couple; Antiono Brown and Le'Veon Bell, just to mention.
Yes, and don't forget their great quarterback, Benjamin Roethlisberger.
Big Ben, knows how to make much needed plays happen.
I know right. He is a good quarterback.
Didn't he play in 3 superbowls?
I believe so, and think the last one was in 2010.
Hey do you remember that touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes against the Cardinals, that helped them win?
Yeah, many think that the call was wrong and the Cardinals should have one.
Well, they did review the play and confirmed it was a catch.
Yes they did. Oh, let's not forget Antonio Browns' one handed catch during the colts game last season.
Right. that boy can play.
I think he will have a long career with the Steelers. What about you?
As long as he does not get seriously injured.
I only know of one time that he missed a game in the pass 4 season.
That was for a concussion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Our local college football team is great!
It is? I don't really follow college football. I prefer the NFL.
Well, we've had a few of our players, like Tevin Mitchel, get drafted in the NFL lately.
That doesn't sound that special to me though. Pretty much every college does.
You've got a good point. I guess I'm just excited.
Why?
My last college's football team was really bad.
Why don't you start watching some NFL games then?
I guess I could do that.
I think you'd get really into it if you let yourself.
Do you have any teams that you're a big fan of?
I grew up in Minnesota, so I like the Vikings.
And hate the Packers?
Of course. That's practically genetic.
Rivalries like that are always so funny to me.
Why?
They just seem silly. It's such low stakes.
That's the fun of it though! Getting wrapped up in something that doesn't matter is fun.
I guess I can understand that.
See what I mean?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like when the Sants won it all?
Yeah, it was cool
But, you're a Cardinals fan.
I know, but I was still happy for them
That's interesting
I did not like when the Ravens won
Why?
I was in a casino and there was a terrible fan there
I see
Fans can ruin teams for me
Well, Baltimore has not been back in a long time
They never will be either
You really don't like them
I don't
Are you a 49ers fan?
No
Well, they are the team the Ravens beat in the Super Bowl
I like the 49ers, but I am a Cardinals fan
Do you think they'll do good this coming year?
Maybe
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the NFL?
Yes.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Atlanta Falcons.
Why do you like them?
My old teacher used to play for them?
Why did he decide to start teaching?
He got injured.
It is a dangerous sport.
Yeah, it might not last forever.
There are plenty of people who get injured.
Yeah, it's all the tackling.
I would be scared to get tackled by some of them.
Yeah, the pads only do so much.
I like to watch it on TV.
Yeah, with all the camera angles, you get a lot of detail.
Have you ever been to a game?
No.
Would you like to see one?
That might be fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So isn't it weird that the Rams are in Los Angeles now?
Yeah, it seems like they should still be in St. Louis.
When I was a kid, they moved to St. Louis, and it seems wasteful that they moved back again.
I know, but I'm sure it has to do with money.
Oh yeah, someone is getting very rich off the deal.
Have you seen the temporary stadium that they are playing in?
Yes, it doesn't quite look NFL-level, but I know they are constructing a new state-of-the-art stadium.
It will probably be crazy how modern it is.
Yeah, the new fields are just insane with how different they look.
The one that just opened up in Minnesota is very futuristic-looking.
Yes that one is nice, but I like the one in San Francisco that they built for the 49ers.
Oh yeah, that stadium is unique.
So now it seems that the Raiders are leaving Oakland for Las Vegas.
Yes, I heard that crazy news.
So they will have to build a new stadium in Las Vegas for when they move.
Can you imagine what it will look like?
No, but since it is Vegas and the Raiders, I bet it will be very attention-grabbing.
They will have a one-of-a-kind place for sports entertainment.
I agree, and they'll have no problem filling it to capacity with tons of fans.
It will be an event, that's for sure, but ticket prices probably will be astronomical to get in there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about those Lions?
Hard to say, at least they started to focus on their offensive line.
Maybe Stafford will get a chance to really show what he's got.
Do you think there are enough receiver options for him?
The Lions always have enough receiving options.
They had an awful lot of drops last year.
That's true, do you think that has something to do with Stafford?
I am not sure but I think he is really good.
Do you think he is worth being the highest paid QB in the NFL?
That is a tough question, he is definitely worth a lot of money.
Tom Brady is worth a lot of money but he takes a lower salary for the team.
Yeah, at some point people just have enough money and want to win.
What team do you think is going to be the biggest challenge in the division?
It always seems to be the Packers by the time it's all said and done.
Aaron Rodgers is pretty great.
Yeah, even with the slow start last year he managed to turn it around, like usual.
The Bears have the highest paid backup QB in the league now.
Haha, yeah, that makes them a force to be reckoned with!
The RB is always an issue for the Lions, I wonder if they finally figured it out.
Tion Green seems like the usual kind of pick up, but here's to hoping!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is this the last year for the Seahawks to make another run?
Most definitely, Russell and Sherman seem to hate each other.
Sherman seems to hate everyone.
True. Talented player, but a bit of a headcase.
Yeah, and now he's getting older. Seems like he has seen his best days.
I won't count him out, but you may have a point.
I think I do, I think he's a locker room cancer.
Yeah, but they say the defensive players love him.
Yeah, but the offensive players hate him.
So, it's kind of a rough situation.
Yeah, but I will say that the Seahawks are talented this year.
Yep and I think they upgraded their running attack.
That'll be big. They haven't looked the same since Marshawn left.
Beast Mode was a huge loss when he "retired".
Man, I love the way he played, just did not care.
Yep, and he was a funny dude.
I love those types of characters in the NFL.
Not many of them left with how corporate it has become.
That's true, but I hope with them legalizing touchdown celebrations again, it'll change.
Yeah, I agree. Hopefully it'll loosen things up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Unlucky.
But Marshawn Lynch is back now!
Yeah, he's gonna rock!
Okay, what about the other football players?
Mehh, they're aiight
Speaking of football players, what about their wives?
Ohhh, I see some of them are cute.
Like who?
Nahhh, not the football players, the actresses!
Like who?
JLO, Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton!
Okay, but what about them?
Wait, I'm not done with the list yet!
Okay, go on.
Kylie Minoque, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Kaitlyn Jenner, Kendall Jenner
........
Kris Jenner, Joan Rivers, Joan Collins, Chiquis Rivera, Mel B.
Uhhhhh
Can I continue with the actresses that all wear fur or no?
Now, you're just getting off topic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you recall who won the 2nd Super Bowl?
I believe it was the Green Bay Packers.
Didn't they win the first one as well.
Yes, they won the first two back-to-back.
Wow, they must've been pretty good back in the day.
Yeah, they had Vince Lombardi as their coach back then.
Oh yeah, they named the trophy after him.
Yeah, they were the first real NFL dynasty
Do you remember who they played?
Yeah, it was the Oakland Raiders
Who then became the L.A. Raiders
Who then became the Oakland Raiders
Who are now the Las Vegas Raiders.
Man, those Raiders move around a lot.
They sure do.
Who was the Packers' QB back then?
Bart Starr
That's right. Hall of Famer
Yeah, the first legendary QB
Yeah, followed by many others.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you as excited as me for the upcoming NFL season?
Yes! I need some football in my life in the worst way!
Let's talk about who the best defensive team is going to be this season.
Sounds like fun, who do you have?
I think this year the Seattle Seahawks will emerge as the leauge's best defense.
That is a pretty good pick in my opinion. Pete Carroll has focused on that side of the ball ever since he has been there.
Yea and he has a good defensive coordinator to run things in Kris Richard.
They sure do have a lot of talent on defense as well, and that always helps!
They were able to keep Richard Sherman this year and that was huge!
I kept hearing rumors that they were looking to trade him.
That is what was in the news, but who knows how true that stuff really was.
Do you think Sherman is the most important player that they have on defense?
I am not sure about that, Earl Thomas is pretty important himself.
He sure is! After he went down with that broken leg last year their defense was never the same.
No it was not. Do you think the Seahawks will be the best D as well?
Maybe, although I am pretty high on the Houston Texans' defense for this upcoming season myself.
I forgot about them! Yea they should be pretty good on that side of the ball this season.
I love Mike Vrabel as the defensive coordinator, plus they have great talent as well.
J.J Watt might be the best defensive player in the NFL.
Yea and do not forget about Jadeveon Clowney either, he is a beast in his own right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading about the top draft pick for the 2018 NFL draft.
Who's the top pick?
Sam Darnold, a QB from USC. He threw 31 touchdowns last season.
Sounds like he has quite an arm.
He completed 67% of his throws, so he's pretty good.
So he's the top pick, huh?
Maybe not. The article said he might play a couple more seasons at USC.
He's going to wait for the 2019 season?
He still has time to decide, but several people close to him have said he might want to play with USC a couple more seasons.
It makes sense, if you are doing well on a team, you want to keep that up.
Yeah, but if he gets hurt it could stop his chances from the big leagues.
I'm sure his team is going to try and protect such a valuable player.
It depends on how well he plays this season. If he does well and is the number one pick, that would be hard to pass up.
How many yards did he throw last season?
Over 3,000. So all eyes are going to be on him this season.
Especially the scouts. That's a lot of pressure on Darnold.
Yeah, but it's a good pressure to see how well he'd do in the NFL.
They can always use a good quarterback in the NFL.
Yeah, especially since some of the QB's are getting older and probably going to be retiring.
Somehow, I see Tom Brady playing with grey hair and never retiring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL season begins on September 07, 2017 this year, and I can't wait.
Oh really? Do you know which teams will be playing?
Of course I know who is playing. It's my favorite team that won the Superbowl last year.
Are you talking about the Patriots?
Absoultely!! They will be playing against the Chiefs. I will be watching front center row.
Yeah the Chiefs are a good team.
But the Patriots are number one in my book, they have been my favorite team since the beginning. Who is your favorite team?
I am a fan of the Greenbay Packers.
Greenbay? They haven't won a superbowl since 2011 when they played against the Steelers.
Yeah that is true but the Packer played a good season that year and last year.
Hmm. What was the score when the Packers played against the Steelers in 2011.
It was pretty close. The score was 31-25
I guess Green Bay is alright but they are no match to the Patriots.
Oh man here you go with that again!!
Well I could actually brag. The Patriots won the super bowl in 2015 and 2017.
Yeah so what. You can't deny that the Packers played a good season last year.
Yeah I hear what you are saying.
I can't wait for the Packers first game this season so they can show you what they are made of.
Yeah we will just have to see about that. When do they play?
The Packers first game is September 10, and they are playing against the Seahawks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of last year's Super Bowl?
I was disappointed, I really thought the Falcons had it.
You're right, they did have a 28-3 lead after the first half.
Brady really brought the Patriots back though.
Yeah, but not until the 4th quarter.
He really proved his greatness!
Not really, I think he's fading.  He missed a lot of opportunities in the first half.
And it was such a long game, 4 and a half hours!
I couldn't believe it when the Patriots made that 2-point conversion! Yeah, and with only 6 minutes left!
I still thought the Falcons had it in the bag...
Especially after Jones caught that 27 yard pass that put Atlanta on the Patriots 22 yard line!
Yeah, a field goal and the game would have been over.
Things really turned when Ryan got sacked!
And that holding call on Jake Matthews - I was losing hope fast.
Yeah, going from being on the 22 yard line with a chance to clinch it, to having to punt was a real let down.
I was so tense, I coultn't stand it!!!
Then Edelman catches the ball on the 50 yard line!  1:28 was plenty of time for Brady to at least tie the game...
Which he did! And then the Patriots won the coin toss.....
Yep, then the Patriots march right on down the field and win it all.
It would’ve been great to see if Atlanta could have regrouped and won.   Maybe this year.....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who won Super Bowl IV?
That would be the Kansas City Chiefs
Oh really, I didn't realize they won a Super Bowl
Yeah, that's when Hank Stram was their coach.
Oh yeah, the coach that always wore those blazers
Yeah, that's the one.
Do you remember who they played?
Yeah, it was the Minnesota Vikings
Oh really, I didn't realize the Vikings have been to the Super Bowl.
Yeah, they've been, but never won.
Where did they play it back then?
I believe it was in New Orleans
The Super Dome?
No, they didn't have the dome back then.
Must've been an outdoor stadium then.
Yeah, I can't remember where though.
So the Chiefs haven't done much since then
Not really. Always close, but never a clincher
Yeah, tough for the fans.
At least they have one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey they posted the Nfl schdules.
Yes i say them.
Are you guys going to any games this year?
I really would like to go to the Steelers Browns first game.
When is that.
It is the Steelers first game and it is September 10 at noon.
Isnt that the 2 that have a rivlery between the two cities Pittsburgh and Cleveland.
Yes the mayors trade stuff back and forth depending on who wins.
Normally always Pittsburgh.
Yes my team normally always wins. Who do you think you guys might go see.
My husband would like to go to a Saints game.
Drew Brees terrible quarterback.
I know he always complains about something it is never his fault when something goes wrong.
I know but my hubby loves them. And who do you like
Im more of a Patriots fan.
Dont care for Tom Brady eigther.
I know you only like Big Ben.
Yes he is a great quarterback
You only like his so much because he is a Steeler.
Well of course
XXXXXXXXXXX
Romo had a nice game against the bears.
Tell me about it. How badly do you have to suck to make Cutler look good?
How do they pick these quarterbacks to start?
I have no idea. Who would fool around with these low calibar quarterbacks this close the bowl?
Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?
Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere.
Rodgers can be cast off as well.
Brady is not too far down on that list.
Sanchez is starting soon. I think he can turn the team around
That could be, but I've learned not to hold my breath after Roethlisberger.
You really thought Ben was that bad?
He wasn't awful, but definitely not worth writing home about.
Yeah, I guess that's true. I don't see Roethlisberger getting them any closer to the Super Bowl.
For some reason he remind me of Vick, classic Vick.
I can see that. He was better as a rookie, but not too consistent.
That's true, but teams would kill for his trade.
Cam Newton stood out more to me than Roethlisberger ever did.
Yes, but Cam had much better coaching.
Yeah, Roethlisberger had his best coaching in college.
Exactly, if he got drafted I can see him excelling past Brady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think there was a good draft this year?
I think there is a good draft every year.
Why is that?
Because there are always some people taken in the late rounds who end up surprising everyone. Those are the best.
Oh? Like who?
Well, for example, in the 2000 draft there were 6 quarterbacks drafted before Tom Brady.
So?
So, he wasn't taken until the 6th round and look at him now.
Yeah, I guess that's pretty impressive.
You never know who is going to turn into a great player.
So you love every draft?
Yeah, That's a possibility for every year.
But a lot of times it's the first picks that count.
not always, Sometimes players picked in the first few picks end up being a bust.
Yeah, like who?
Ryan Leaf. He was drafted 2nd overall by the chargers in 1998.
So?
His career ended in 2001. And he ended up in prison eventually.
Wow, that's crazy.
You never know what you're really getting from your draft picks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the 49ers play the Bears last night?
No, both of those teams are terrible.
Yep, I agree. I only watched it because I was bored.
What was the final score?
Bears won 26 to the 49ers 6 points.
That's really bad. The 49ers could only get one touchdown.
Yes, and they missed a field goal.
That's almost unbelievable. Who started at QB for the 49ers?
Gabbert got the start.
How many passing yards did Gabbert throw for?
Gabbert only threw for a measly 35 yards.
Wow. That's crazy. What did Chicago's QB do?
I think Barkley threw for about 192 yards.
Well, it's no surprise that his team won the game.
Yes, I completely agree.
How many rushing yards did the 49ers get?
The 49ers got 141 rushing yards as a team.
Oh, that's more than I thought they would get.
Yes, overall it was a pretty sad game.
I'm glad I didn't watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite NFL team?
I am from Minnesota so it has to be the Vikings.
Yuck.
Why do you say yuck?
Because I am from Wisconsin.
Oh, so you are a cheese head?
That is right.  Packer fan through and through.
I guess that makes us rivals.
It sure does.
Who do you think will win this year?
I think the Packers will win both regular season games against the Vikings.
I doubt that.
They have done pretty well the past few years.
True, but I think this year will be different.
There is one thing I have liked about the Vikings in the past few years.
What is that?
I thought Adrian Pederson was a very good running back.
Yes he was.
That is all the compliments you will get from me.
I figured that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football this year?
Hell yea! I can't wait Falcons all the way this year baby.
You really think they will make the Super Bowl again?
I do Matt Ryan was on fire last year no one will stop him.
I don't know Tom Brady and the Patriots I think might repeat.
No way man Brady is getting old and Matt Ryan is still young and has alot of years in front of him.
The Seahawks and Packers are tough too. I like Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers isn't too bad. Cam Newton is good but he needs more weapons. Panthers has a chance.
Panthers I agree unless the Saints come around. Drew Brees hasn't been himself lately.
Drew Brees needs to retire. The problem with quaterbacks is they don't know when to call it quits.
You mean like Brett Favre. He kept playing and playing.
Exactly he never knew when to quit. Speaking of the Falcons did you hear they are retiring Michael Vick?
I did regardless of his criminal record he was still a hell of an athelete. I still think he would have made a better running back.
Yes I agree once he starts running no one could stop him.
You know it could be the Patriots and the Falcons again in the Super Bowl this year. Imagine that.
Never happened before in the history of the NFL I don't think two teams repeating. One team yes but not two teams.
With the Falcons getting the new stadium this year that would be great too.
We will see what happens if Oakland's quarterback doesn't get hurt at the end of the season they might go further this year.
Yes that was horrible for them. That rookie was amazing too.
This season will be great to see what these second year quarterbacks can do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the 2000 Seattle Seahawks?
Boy what a team! They finished 6–10 that year.
Jon Kitna was in his absolute prime.
No one could argue that. They also got Alexander in the draft.
He should be in the Hall of Fame.
Alexander? That's a questionable assertion.
Not questionable at all. I don't believe he should be excluded.
He was NFL MVP one year.
And they got him in 2000. No doubt.
Who else did they get in 2000?
They selected Chris McIntosh as well as Darrell Jackson.
If only they could have held on to Jackson!
I know! He was great San Francisco.
Absolutely. In his seventh year? He was spectacular.
I guess time wins all battles.
That's a very good NFL statement.
Time does often win.
It does. The team with the worst NFL record gets the first draft pick.
Eventually, that team becomes the best and gets the last pick.
The system works.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up? Are you ready for the football season?
I can't wait. We just got a new projection T.V. and green wall for watching NFL games.
Great! Who do you think will go all the way this year?
If I had to bet on it today I would say the Patriots.
It's hard to deny their talent but I am not a fan.
Understood. That whole Aaron Hernandez fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth.
They knew who he was and what he was capable of before they drafted him!
He had enough off the field problems to scare most teams away. Pats are all about winning.
Speaking of tight ends, I like Greg Olsen from the Panthers.
Olsen is cool and I think that Travis Kelce is going to have a big year.
What about Gronk? He's on top right now.
He's great when he's playing but I think he's injury prone.
If he stay off of the bench and on the field he'll be unstoppable this year.
Same with Jordan Reed from the Skins. he's got mad skills.
Yup. He missed four games last year.
Do you think that Matt Ryan still has what it takes to win a ring?
Absolutely! I have been a Ryan fan since he was with Boston College.
He's a tough guy, this year will depend on his offensive line.
I believe the O line is the key ingredient for any team's offense.
Yes it is and that is why the Patriots always dominate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you following the NFL?
Yeah for sure. I watch every Sunday in the fall no matter who is on.
Who is your team?
I'm a Steelers fan.
So it my dad. I'm Patriots all the way?
How did you end up a Pats fan?
My uncle was so I decided I would be do.
I guess you can thank him for that!
I guess so. It is fun watching a team who wins a lot, I'll admit it, but it's hard to say I'm a fan when everyone responds with "bandwagon."
That's true. I'm sure you've heard that a lot.
I do. And then I have to tell them I liked them with Bledsoe was still the quarterback and that helps a little.
That's good. I mean, the Steelers haven't been over the top recently, but they've won a lot too.
For you. You have the most Super Bowls!
True. I can't imagine being a fan of the Bills or Eagles or a team like that.
It would definintely be painful. They're loyal though.
Kuddos to them! I guess I would be to the Steelers too, but I wouldn't like it.
Very true. Steelers should be decent again this year.
Yeah, it is tough to say. No guarantees like the Pats.
Hey, I don't see it as a guarantee. You never know.
Right. Any given Sunday. Isn't that the motto?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me what your thoughts are about the new NFL Season.
I am really excited for the regular season to get underway.
I know what you mean - it is almost painful waiting on the regular season during the summer
Exactly - the pre-season and summer camps are usually disappointing, it has no resemblance to the regular season.
If anything it always seems like the pre-season and regular season are exact opposites.
Right - what I hate is when someone from my favorite team gets injured during pre-season.
Yes! that has happened before to my teams.  Who is your favorite team.
I have a couple I watch faithfully. But living in the Washington DC area. I am a Redskins fan.
Wow lots new there this year. What do you think about the Doug Williams hire?
I like all other fans of the Redskins - love him. But I think he is in a no-win job.
Yeah if I guy like Joe Gibbs came back and couldn't fix things or get them better - not sure anyone can.
The best news we would ever get as fans is if Dan Snyder sells the team.
Thats never going to happen though.
Well one can hope - maybe he will get an offer he can't refuse one day.
Do you have any opinions on the Redkins name controversy?
Yes - I totally see both sides of it - but again it's a Dan Snyder thing I think.
Yeah - what would you like to see happen if it was your choice.
If it were up to me - I look at it and say if it is offensive - who am I to keep something so major that it offends so many people.
I feel the same... it's not like it is a cool name or the best franchise name ever.
And the fact it is our Capital city is bad too... it should be something government or US related I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm ready for football season to start.
Me too.
I'm going to a few of the Dolphins games this year.
I am too. You get tickets already?
Yes, I'm going to see them play the Bucaneers.
When is that game?
It's September 10th?
I I'm going to the game when the play the Jets in October.
The Jets suck. The dolphins will mop the floor with them.
Yeah they will. That's why I chose that game.
You gonna paint your face?
No, that's a bit too far for my taste.
But you gotta support the home team.
I am supporting the home team by paying for a ticket to see their game.
When I go I am going to paint my face and so will all my pals?
Why?
We wanna spell a word?
What word are you trying to spell?
DOLPHINS.
More like Doofus!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the giants?
Yes i think they are good
Me too
They won a superbowl in the year i was born
Which one?
1987
Oh yea
They win pretty frequesntly
Yes their last one was in 2012
I hope they go again soon
Me too
Watching them in the superbowl is exciting
Yes i agree
They have a great coach too
Yes i love ben mcadoo
Hes good at his job
He is
The giants are winners
Absolutely
Good talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Buffalo Bills should have fired Rex Ryan?
Yes, he wasn't a very good coach and has a bad temper.
Who did they hire as a new coach?
Sean McDermott, I think he will do a good job.
Where did Sean McDermott last coach?
He coached the defense for the Carolina Panthers.
I hope Tyrod Taylor can have a good year, do you think he will?
It's hard to say but he really needs to pass for more yards this year.
Do you think Sammy Watkins can stay healthy for the whole season?
I don't know, he seems to be a very injury prone wide reciever.
What other good wide receivers doe the Bills have?
They have Brandon Tate and they just drafted Zay Jones, hopefully they can be productive.
Who else did the Bills draft this year?
They drafted Jason Croom, Dion Dawkins, Anthony Harrell and Jordan Johnson, we'll see how well they can perform.
Is Richie Incognito still on the team?
Yes he is and he seems to be playing well and staying out of trouble.
Will LeSean McCoy have a 1000 yard rushing season this year?
It's very possible, he's very talented but it depends on how many carries he can get in this offense.
Have you ever seen the Bills play in person?
Yes, it's a lot fun to see them play in person!
XXXXXXXXXXX
There was some controversy over an NFL player's football cards not having an authentic signature.
Which player?
Dak Prescott from the Dallas Cowboys.
What position does he play?
He's a quarterback for the Cowboys.
Were the signatures fake?
No, but they were supposedly stamped by a machine instead of him signing them.
Football cards are big business. That would make some people very angry.
The trading card company said it wasn't his fault becaus he didn't know how the cards were sent.
Did they recall all the cards?
They tried. They stopped deliveries to 110 customers, but 167 were still sent out.
People pay good money for those, so they wuld be upset if they were misled about them.
He is supposed to sign all the replacement cards.
If they straighten it out, I doubt it would hurt business.
Not for him. They still announced they had signed a trading card contract with him for the future.
Merchandise makes a lot of athletes a lot of money.
Especially trading cards, because people think they still retain value and can be sold later.
It depends on the player, but also how well the card is taken care of.
I know what you mean. I knew a guy whose dad left him boxes of cards, and the stupid guy left them in the garage where they got mildew and mice droppings on them.
One man's treasure is another man's junk as they say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking about having some of the guys over and have a trivia night.
Sounds good. What's the topic going to be?
NFL facts because they think they know a lot I am going  to do my best to find some odscura.
This should be fun. What do you want me to bring?
We'll talk about that in a minute. First I want to run some facts by you that I have found so far.
Okay go for it!
My husband will probably  know this one since he is a Pats fan. The New England Patriots The Bay State Patriots.
Kind of interesting but I know you have some better ones.
Yes I do. How about the Monday following the Super Bowl, antacid sales increase by 20 percent.
That isn't hard to believe!!!
Here are some more to do with food. It is estimated that over 8 million pounds of guacamole is consumed on Super Bowl Sunday.
Holy Guacamole!
Really?? You went there?
But of course!
On Super Bowl Sunday, it is estimated that 14,500 tons of potato chips are eaten. How did you like that one?
That one is definitely a good one for trivia.
For a year’s supply of footballs for the NFL, it takes 3,000 cows.
Holy cow.....holey  get it?
Aww come on now enough with the lameness. I need help.
Yeah I know you do! Ha ha
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi! Do you like the Seahawks?
The Seahawks? I love the Seattle Seahawks.
How do you think Wilson will do this year?
I think he will do well. He will recover from his injuries last year.
Will his diet impact his play?
Oh, I think so.
How so?
He's eating much better than last year; he has a nutritionist and a trainer now.
I saw he was eating organically.
I saw that too.
Will the offensive line be any better?
I hope so. Who did they get?
Exactly. I don't know how the line will be any better at all.
I think the Seahawks can win, it's just a question of if they want to win.
That's such a great point. They beat the Patriots last year.
Yes, in New England too.
Yes, but they couldn't beat the Falcons in Atlanta after much more rest, for example.
The Falcons weren't as good as the Patriots too.
That is one hundred percent correct.
I'm looking forward to next season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
I love it!
Oh, yea?  What is your favorite team?
Buffalo!
Let's go Buffalo!
Oh, you too?
Yea, man!
How do you think they'll do without Rex Ryan?
The head coach?  I think they'll do better
Really?  See I didn't think it was his fault
See I think it was partially his fault
I don't think so.  The QB needed replaced
Well they did that too!
I know.  But I would have kept Rex
I'm all for the changes
See, I think they did too many.  Now they're too new
But it will pay off in the long run
I'm not so sure
In any case, we'll find out soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will go to the Super Bowl this year?
I think the Falcons have a good chance.
What about the Patriots?
I think they also have a great chance.
Matt Ryan is a stud.
He had a great year last year and I expect the same this year.
We will see, I still think the Patriots are going to win it.
I think that's a safe bet, but watch out for the Dolphins.
The Dolphins?!
Yes, the Dolphins have the tools this year to be great.
I don't think that this is their year, maybe next year.
You will be surprised. They made some necessary signings.
Yes, but they still don't have that start QB.
Tannehill has grown a lot, so we will see.
Yes, but still not the greatest.
I agree, but I think they may surprise you.
Hopefully they will! I like it when they're relevant.
They were garbage for like a decade, unfortunately.
Last year they definitely made great strides.
Hopefully the Phins will do so again this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest quarterback in Philadelphia Eagles history?
Well I am too young to remember Normal Van Brocklin people say he was good for the time.
If we go by Super Bowls I guess you might say Ron Jaworski.
Well, he didn't win the Superbowl, Donovan McNabb appeared in one too.
The Eagles didn't have any one super quarterback like a Tom Brady or Peyton Manning.
No, I think McNabb has to be a contender though.
He was the quarterback over a number of good years.
They have had many short term solutions.
Like Michael Vick, Bobby Hoying, Rodney Peete, Nick Foles, Sam Bradford?
Yes, those are some of the guys in revolving quarterbacks.
Randall Cunningham was another one who played for a while.
I agree it comes down to those three for at least the time I have been alive.
It's either Jaworski, Cunningham, or McNabb.
I'd say I'd have to go with McNabb at this point.
He had his flaws but the best on the list.
Maybe Carson Wentz will be on the list someday.
Hopefully he will be like a Brady.
One can only dream.
We will see how it plays out will know a lot more after this upcoming year.
Time to be optimistic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl IX.
Who played?
Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings.
I know the Vikings never won a Superbowl.
Right, this was Pittsburgh's first Superbowl victory.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Terry Bradshaw for Pittsburgh and Fran Tarkenton for Minnesota.
Where did they play?
Tulane Stadium, New Orleans.
Not the Superdome?
It was not ready.
Who scored in the first quarter?
No score in the first quarter and only 2 in the second.
Wow, a safety.  Who played at halftime?
Grambling State band with Duke Ellington's son.
Classier than modern shows.
Pittsburgh finally scored a touchdown in the third quarter.
When did the Vikings score?
Fourth quarter, missed point after, 9-6.
Too bad.  I liked Fran Tarkenton.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are lot of interesting things about the NFL that I didn't know and probably a lot of people didn't know
Like what kinds of things are you referring to?
THE TOTAL AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TELEVISED FOOTBALL GAME IN 1939 WAS 500, ABOUT 112,200,500 LESS THAN WATCHED LAST YEAR’S SUPER BOWL.
That's amazing to think about you know.
How about this one. Carl Weathers that plays Apollo Creed in the Rocky movie played fro the Oakland Raiders for 2 seasons in the 1970's
That's pretty obscure but cool to know.
This is one I like a lot since I went to college there during this time.The UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA liked THE GREEN BAY PACKERS helmet logo so much that coach Vince Dooley borrowed the look for their helemet
Is that an okay thing to do?
I suppose so ...he did it.
True. Tell me some more weird ones.
Okay let's see what I can come up with for you. Here you go. Guess how much the Super Bowl Trophy costs?
Ummm $3000
Way off! Try $25,000!
What!!!! Are you kidding me!
Here's a good one about the NFL football.
Lay it on me.
Wilson has been making them since 1941 at 4000 a day.
Just for the NFL?
Yes and one cowhide makes 10 footballs.
These are some pretty fun things to know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you think it is strange that some states have several teams.
Yes I do.
And then some states have no teams.
Where are all the multiples?
Well California has a bunch.
They have Oakland, San Francisco, LA and San Diego right?
Yeah.  Four teams in one state.
What about Florida.  How many do they have?
They have Jacksonville and Tampa Bay.
What about the Dolphins?
Oh yes, I forgot Miami.
And then I suppose New York has a couple teams.
Bills, Jets and Giants.
I guess I had never really thought of that.
It must be strange.  How do you choose what your home team is.
I suppose however you are raised usually.
It was easy for me.
Why is that?
I grew up in Wisconsin.
I suppose everyone is a Packer fan there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do the Eagles play?
They play in South Philly.
What's the name of their field?
Lincoln Financial.
Have you been there?
Yep, it's awesome!
They have such fun things for the kids to do as well.
I'd love to go sometime.
Me too.
I can't wait for the season to start.
Who is their biggest rival this year?
I think the Cowboys.
They are always a run for the money.
They are so competitive against one another.
You're not kidding.
I hope the Eagles win.
Me too.
Who else do you think will be exciting to watch them play?
I think that the Patriots will be an interesting team to play.
That will be cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will you watch the NFL this year on TV?
You bet.
What team is going to win the Super Bowl this year?
I think it will be the Patriots?
Wow, I would have said the Steelers.
You wish.
I sure hope so.
When's the last time the Steelers won the Super Bowl?
It was 2009.
Who did they beat.
They beat the Arizona Cardinals.
Yeah that's right.
It was a close one.
Wow, now I remember that.
I would love to attend a Super Bowl.
I think you need a lot of money to go to those.
You probably need an invitation as well.
Tickets seem to be hard to get, aren't they?
Yes, I think the president even goes to the game sometimes.
I want to be President!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Most overrated team in the NFL? Go.
Gotta be the Cowboys.
Why do you say that?
Zeke and Dak were good last year but rookies sometime take backward steps.
That's true, but their offensive line is deadly.
Deadly, yes, but getting old.
True, me personally, I think the Falcons are due for a step back.
Why do you say that?
That rough Super Bowl loss will be tough to get over.
True, they may play tense.
Yep, and when you're tense, you make mistakes.
That's very true, but they are still talented.
Talented, yes, but, they may be soft.
Come on, don't discount them that much.
Just saying, it's a tough loss to get over.
Yeah, but what about the Patriots?
What about them?
Don't you think they may also regress after the emotional high.
Brady is such a stoic, I don't think it'll affect him.
Yes, but maybe Father Time will...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do you think the league goes from here?
In what sense?
Do you think the concussion lawsuits will make the game worse
To a degree yes but I think the game will sustain itself.
Do you think players salaries will rise as a hazard pay?
No I do not think that at all. In fact they may dip
Why do you think that
TV contracts are not going to be as expensive next time around
So how do the players thwart that?
They are going to have to give an extra 2 games a year
Why not take them off the preseason
Cause the owners wont let that happen
Then give them two byes a year.
Yeah that will take the league well into March
I would be ok with that.
So would the rest of America I am sure.
Do you think this could happen soon?
Yeah around the time the next CBA needs to be agreed.
I hope you are right
Yeah I think i am for once
XXXXXXXXXXX
What role did Jim Thorpe play in founding the NFL.
He was the president of the original league.
What was that league called?
It was called the American Professional Football Association -- the APFA.
When did that happen?
It happened in 1920.
What was the goal of the league?
It was to improve football in all ways.
When did it become the NFL?
They changed the name in 1922.
What are some interesting stories from the early days?
In 1932, the championship was played indoors.
No way! Where was it at?
It was at Chicago Stadium.
Isn't that where Michael Jordan played?
Yes, the Bull won a championship there.
It must have been strange to see an NFL game there.
I think so. The score was also strange.
What was it?
The Chicago Bears beat the Portsmouth Spartans 9 to 0.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think that the Browns have any chance of ending the season at .500?
Man, I don't think so, even with their draft picks this year I just don't see that happening.
Yeah, I agree.
Also, they need to get their quarterback situation figured out.
Yeah they do! They haven't had someone that they can rely on to run the offense in so long.
And they need to find a head coach that they can stick with for a long time.
Yeah, I think that they should've stuck with Mike Pettine back when they had him.
Yeah, I don't get why they didn't stick with him. I think that he could've really done something with the team if given more of a chance.
Yeah, the front office doesn't ever seem to give head coaches much of a chance.
They have no patience!
I also feel really bad for Joe Thomas. That man has been so dedicated to the team his whole career.
Yeah I know! They guy hasn't even seen the playoffs since he's been in the league.
He has a chance to be a hall of famer.
Yeah he does! I just hope that someday he's able to at least make it into the playoffs somehow.
I honestly would be happy if they could go 4-12 this season.
Yeah me too, but I don't even know if that's realistic.
How many wins do you think they can get this year?
I say maybe two or three games. Three might even be pushing it.
Well, I guess we'll see. I still say that they can get four wins.
I'm still sticking with two or three.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think of the Colts?
I don't know, are they any good?
Of course! They keep taking the division every year.
So have they won a Superbowl?
Once. We're going to get it again this year, I just know it.
Has their performance been good this season?
Yeah, they were good last season, but with the new players, they're unstoppable.
Do they have a new runningback?
Yeah, they just got a new guy from Miami that's looking really promising.
Oh, I forgot his name, but wasn't he the starring player at his college?
Yeah, and he killed the trials too.
So it looks like it's going to be a running year?
Yeah, but not just that, our quarterback can pass too.
Can he fill Peyton's shoes?
Better than that, he had no interceptions last year.
What about fumbles?
Yeah, but just the one though, against Jacksonville.
Well yeah, their tightend is really something.
Maybe, but our center is going to shut them down.
We'll see about that. Go Colts!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like to go to the SUPERBOWL this year.
New England is certainly going to be a big favorite.
They're a big favorite every year.
No matter what players they lose is pickup.
They find a way to win.
It's a top notch organization.
Yes it is.
Do you think Atlanta will make it again?
I don't know. Sometimes you only get one shot.
They certainly blew their shot last year.
Hard to believe they lost that game.
Some people think the raiders have a shot.
They could be really good.
If Derek Carr comes back healthy they'll be good.
How about Pittsburgh making a run.
They're offense can be scary good.
If their defense takes it up a notch they can be in the mix.
Yes they can.
Big Ben tends to get hurt a lot.
Yes,his style of play is why.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sir, I am a huge Vikings fan.
The Vikings? Of Minnesota?
The very same.
Well, it's great to meet another Vikings fan here in Florida.
Did you come down to retire too?
Yes sir, it's nice and warm here even in the dead of winter.
I would go back to see that playoff game, though.
Oh, I would too, in a heartbeat.
I just with Walsh could have made that kick.
Oh me too, I couldn't believe he shanked it to the left.
It was very cold that day.
He still should have made the kick.
Do you know he plays for Seattle now?
Oh, is that right?
He's competing for a spot on their roster now.
That isn't surprising. He practically gave the game away last year.
Seattle's kicker went rouge too.
He still hit a few in that Vikings game.
Yes, that is true.
Let's hope Blair Walsh plays for the Seahawks next year and cost them a playoff game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How excited are you for the season this year?
Oh man, I'm really hype, I got a new TV and set up my room very nice.
Oh that's pretty cool man.
Ya, I'm pretty excited. How about you?
I actually got a season's worth of tickets as a reward from my work.
Oh my god, that's amazing!
Ya I couldn't believe it when they told me
Ya I wouldn't believe it man.
Ya, if you're interested, I could take a few people with me to a few of the games.
Oh dude that would be amazing!
It's no problem man, I got them for free after all.
What games are they for
They're actually for some Patriots games.
Oh that's perfect, they're my favorite team!
I think they're a little overrated, especially lately, but it'll still be really fun.
To each their own, I'd still be excited either way.
Ya, I'm excited to just go to an NFL game.
I would be too.
I'm just hoping that the Patriots can keep up the record so the games are at least interesting.,
I'm sure they will, they've been one of the best teams for a while now, I'm sure their games will be great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to go a game this year?
What kind of game?
You know exactly what I'm talking about, what game's would I go to besides an NFL game.
I guess you're right.
So do you?
Yeah man, what game are you thinking?
Well, the Jets and Dolphins are playing on September 24th.
In Miami?
Nah, Jets are home, so you'll be a little out of your element.
Haha, I'll be the only Dolphins fan there.
Nah, I'll bring Jess, she's a Dolphins fan too.
Alright awesome, we're going to kill the Jets.
Doubt it, we're looking pretty good this year.
You say that every year, what's different this time.
Enunwa is looking great this year.
And?
Well between him, Forte, and Mccowen, we've got a shot at being decent.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
I'll bet you $200 we win.
I'll take that bet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well you know the NFL has different parts of a season right
How
Well their is pre season for first
What is that
That is games before ranking begins
Then what is after
After that is the main season which is where you are scored on wins and losses
Sounds cool anymore
Well after is their more
Sure their is
Like what
What do you mean
Uh what else
I do not know
Come on
You know
The post season
Oh the super bowl
Yeah that
Sounds ace
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wowie. What happened to you?
It's been a rough week, I don't wanna talk about it.
Okay, that's fine by me. Anyways, we were just talking about the football players of old, what say you?
I overheard that Richard Seymour's back in poker recently.
Really? How'd you find out?
The latest and last tournament of the WSOP season, the WSOP Main Event, it's going on right now throughout this week.
Okay....... since when did you hear about Richard Seymour playing poker?
Dude, he's been playing for a while now. But he's not a pro at it.
Oh, yeah. I did remember him retiring long ago. But I didn't think he'd play poker.
He won a couple of tournaments here and there. Small ones.
Oh, okay. Anybody else that's not playing football after they're retired?
Not really. It's because they showed Seymour playing in the WSOP tournament.
Oh, okay. Now that makes sense.
Yup. What else are you talking about?
Not much. Hey, what about Joe Namath? What does he do now?
Not sure. He's old as heck, though.
When I meant football players of old, I meant football players of old.
You didn't imply of the recently retired ones?
Not really. Speaking of Joe Namath, what do you think of his daughter, Jessica?
I think she looks pretty hot in that fox fur jacket.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Almost time!!! Are you ready for some football!
oh heck yeah! I can't wait!
I'm so ready ! The first game is KC at NE on Thursday night!
I'm pulling for my Chiefs!
Me too. Gronk will be back in full form, so that worries me.
Yeah, but who do they have running the ball? Blount left for Philly.
Heck, It doesn't matter! With Brady they might throw the ball he first 20 plays!
That's true too. They've done it before.
I know Belicheck's record on opening day is great, But so is our boy Andy Reid!
Yes sir. He's great on opening week and coming off byes.
Outstanding. He will have a great game plan!
And if it is a loss, I'd rather go ahead and get it out of the way.
And we will have extra time to get ready for week 2
Yeah, Our first time on opening night.
And do you remember what happened the last time KC opened up at NE?
Oh yes. Brady broke knee and out the rest of the year. NE still went 11-5 with Matt Cassell.
I don't want to hurt Brady, but I want that win bad!!
Well, if lose, maybe we can beat them in January!!
I can't think of anything better!! Winning the AFC Championship in New England!
The only thing better would be winning it at home at Arrowhead. I just can't wait!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best team in the NFL?
The New England Patriots won the last Superbowl, so I think it's fair to say they are the best team.
Are they really the best team though, or did they just have a good run this season?
Well isn't the point of the Superbowl to see who is the best team for each season?
Yes, but then that doesn't answer my question. I asked you who you think the best team in general is.
I would still have to say the Patriots.
Do you think they will win again next season?
Maybe, maybe not. They definitely have a chance though!
All teams have a chance.
Which team do you think is best, in general?
I think it's between a top few. For example, the Seahawks, Broncos, Steelers and even your favorite, the Patriots.
What are you basing this on?
I'm basing it on who makes it to the Superbowl finals, consistently.
I thought you said the winner of the Superbowl doesn't dictate who's best.
The current winner does, but I do think it makes sense to look at who has been doing well over the past few years.
Yes, I do agree that those teams have been consistent.
Consistency is key.
Seahawks have only won once though.
Yes, but they've made it to the finals twice in the past 5 years. That's more than many teams have been doing, trust me.
I agree with you on that one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe the end of the superbowl last year?
No man, I still can't believe it.
It was crazy!
Yeah. As a patriots fan I obviously enjoyed it, but I really didn't expect it.
People can hate all they want, but the patriots are a fantastic team.
I am obviously inclined to agree.
I really think all that deflategate stuff got blown out of proportion.
Me too. But that's the media for you.
Is gronk going to be healthy for this season?
I think so. I'm not actually sure though.
As long as Brady stays healthy we should be good.
Definitely. I don't know how many more years he is going to play.
Me either. I just kind of expect him to be here forever.
Do you think the Patriots will make it to the superbowl again this year?
There's definitely a good chance.
I guess we will have to wait and see how they start to look once the pre-season starts.
Do  you plan on going to any games?
Probably not. I'd rather just watch them at home.
Same. Tickets are so expensive
I hear that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
T minus 2 months until the 2017 NFL season begins. I can't wait!
You know, Minneapolis is having the Superbowl here this year. Or is it next year?
I think this season's Superbowl will actually be played in 2018.
They are already busy making preparations for it and have since the Superbowl this year.
What are they doing?
Asking for volunteers to do all sorts of thing to represent the city and put us in the best possible light.
Cool, are you going to do it?
No. I was involved in the 1991 Superbowl when it was held here.
What did you do?
I worked at a TV station so was on the field the whole time/
That is so cool! Did you get any autographs or photos?
No. I always laugh and say the gig was wasted on me since I don't know a thing about the game or it's players.
Someone else would have appreciated the gig much more.
MUCH more.
Didn't you like it at all?
Some. I saw Prince and Madonna in the audience. And i met the half time performer, Gloria Estefan.
That must have been nice.
It was. But for the life of me I have no idea who played the actual game.
This really was lost on you.
Yes, it was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This should be an exciting NFL season, shouldn't it?
Definitely, who is your favorite team?
Oh the Dallas Cowboys for sure.
You should be excited, the Cowboys have gotten better and have an exciting young quarterback.
Yes I love Dak Prescott, and the offensive line is one of the best in the league.
Maybe this is the Cowboys year to go all the way?
Maybe, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much!  Who is your favorite team?
For me it's the New England Patriots.
Well, you've had a lot to cheer about the last 15 years or so.
Yes, we've been spoiled.  Tom Brady has been probably the best quarterback ever.
Not to mention Bill Belichick may be the best coach ever.
No doubt, without him none of this would have happened.
Do you think Brady will play a lot longer?
He has said he wants to play at least 5 more years, I wouldn't put it past him.
That would put him close to his mid 40s, has that ever happened?
I don't think anyone has played at a high level at that age.
Well, either way I think Garoppolo will be ready, they've been grooming him for years now.
I sure hope so because Brady won't be playing forever.
I'm sure the Patriots will be fine either way.  Good luck to you and the Patriots this year!
Same to you and the Cowboys!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best game you ever played?
Hallway football.
Hallway football?
Yup.
Ok, I'll bite. What is Hallway Football?
Just like it sounds. It is football you play in the hallway.
What, like touch football?
No, like NFL football.  Full contact.
How do you fit 22 players in a hallway, along with referees?
No, no, not like that!  It was a one-on-one game between I and my brother, played in the hallway next to the living room of our house, on our knees, on shag rug, with a nerf ball.
That sounds crazy!
It was! One player would hike the ball, and then try to pus their way down the hallway toward the doorway on the other end, which was the goal line.
But where was your brother while you were crawling through the hallway?
On my back mostly!  We spent hours crawling, slamming each other into the walls, and landing on top of each other until the other couldn't move anymore.
Sounds brutal.
It was, and it was great!  And we imagined that we were our favorite players from our favorite NFL teams.
What were your teams?
I was the Stealers, and my brother was the Raiders. We were totally brutal!
Did you wear uniforms or helmets?
No, we just wore our play closes, and that was the year I wore out the knees on five pairs of jeans on the carpet. My brother and I loved the game, but my mother definitely did not!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, where are you originally from?
I was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland.
Cool, I have heard great things about Baltimore.
It has its good points and bad points, just like any other place.
What will you miss the most about your hometown?
I will miss going to Baltimore Ravens games the most!
I did not know you were a ravens fan!
Yes, I have been a huge Ravens fan for as far back as I can remember.
Who is your all time favorite Ravens player?
That would easily be Ray Lewis!
I figured you would say him. I am sure many Ravens fans would share that opinion with you.
He was such a great leader for so many years for our team.
Many people consider him to be one of the best linebackers of all time.
I am one of those people!
What other players do you like?
My second all time favorite player is Terrell Suggs.
He also seems to be a great leader.
He is, our franchise was blessed with having two outstanding leaders for several years.
So, do you think you could ever become a Bears fan?
No way! I am a Raven for life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The summer is so boring without football!
I agree, not too long until NFL training camps start.
What is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Bears, but they have been bad lately.
Well at least Jay Cutler is gone.
Yeah he was bad.  What team do you like?
I like the Dallas Cowboys.
They had a great season last year.
Yep until that playoff game with the Packers.
That game was insane.  I think they were down 25 points.
Something like that, and then Rodgers made that ridiculous scramble and pass.
Yes that was a great game for the last 3 quarters.
I just hope Dak Prescott is the real deal.
He seems to be, and so does Elliot the running back.
Which game was crazier the Cowboys and Packers, or Patriots and Falcons?
Tough call, but I have to go with the Super Bowl comeback by the Patriots.
Yes I think so too.  Can't believe how Atlanta collapses.
They'll have a tough time forgetting that debacle.
Good thing is ther are a young team.
Yes they are.  Their fans should have some good football to watch in Atlanta for years to come.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
Oh I love it!
Oh, yea?
Yea I love watching them kick that ball!
Dude, I mean American Football.  As in the NFL...
Ohhhh!  Yea I like that too!
Oh yea?
Yea, what's your favorite team?
The Patriots!
The Patriots are terrible!
Terrible!?  How so!?
They always mess things up?
Mess things up?  Like how?
Like they're the worst team in the NFL!
How can you say that?  They won the Super Bowl last year!
How does that make them good?
It's the championship of the NFL?
Yea I really don't watch American Football!
Why did you lie?
For the fun of it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the pre-season game?
For sure.
I am too man.Cam going to kill it this year.
Dude you still keep hope alive don't you.
Ah yes!
Those Panthers slipping though.
No, No, No that's your team.
Don't be talking about my Patriots.
Ya'll going down hard this season.
Why do you say that?
Tom Brady is going to choke on the field.
Brady never chokes.
We can make a bet if you want to.
That's not a problem.
How about $100 if they make it to the Super Bowl.
That's a deal.
If they win, what should we bet?
$250 if they win.
That's a solid bet dude.
Okay then, it will be like taking money from a baby!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think are the Browns going to turn it around this year?
Man they are such a mess.  All those number picks and really not much too show.
It's hard to comprehend since the NFL has a salary cap that they can't put a better product on the field.
It really goes to show what a good front office in the NFL can achieve, or not.
Just look at teams like the Steelers and Patriots.
They seem to always be good and don't always have the best players.
Who is your favorite player?
I like Drew Brees from the Saints.
He is an amazing athleter and seems like a good guy.
No doubt. He is really under-sized too, but he plays with a lot of heart.
I've heard that he is pretty short.
He is, but his arm is incredible.
The Saints really like to pass a lot and are fun to watch.
Them and the Packers can really get after it on offense.
Yes Aaron Rodgers is a great QB.
He has some nice players on offense to pass too.
I like that he has good mobility too.
He doesn't run as much as he did when he was younger, but he still has some juice left in the tank to out run defensive linemen.
He was a great replacement for Favre.
I think so too and they let him learn from him before just inserting him into the lineup.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team?
I sort of have two.
Really, who?
The Steelers and Cowboys.
Not my favorites.
Who's yours?
Miami of course.
The Dolphins?
Yes.
That's right, you liked them since Marino was there.
Best Quarterback ever.
He was good.
Too bad Don Shula doesn't coach them anymore.
Yea, maybe they'd win.
They win some. Don't do too bad.
No, they do pretty good I guess.
Cameron Wake is one of my favorite players.
What position is he?
Defensive End.
Don't knoww the name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how do you think the Seahawks will do this season?
I don't know man, their team is seeming weaker than in seasons past.
Yeah, I agree.
They didn't really seem like they picked anyone up from free agency in the off-season.
Yeah their draft didn't seem very strong either.
Who knows though, they've made some good picks in past drafts.
Yeah, Russell Wilson turned out pretty well, and he wasn't drafted until the later rounds.
I just wonder if they'll ever be able to overcome that devastating loss in the super bowl a few seasons back.
The one where they threw the pick on the goal line?
Yep, against the New England Patriots.
Yeah, that was such a stupid play call.
No doubt. Why would you throw the ball when you still have a time out, and its only second down?
Yeah, and you have Beast Mode in the backfield. Ridiculous.
They should have won that game. All they had to do was hand the ball off.
Yeah, even if he doesn't make it in, you still have the time out, and 3rd and 4th down to try again.
Yeah, I can't believe all the people trying to say that was the right call to throw it there.
Oh well, I guess the Patriots just have a knack for getting gifted super bowls, the same thing happened this year too!
Yeah I saw that, what a pathetic choke job by the Falcons.
Yeah, all they had to do was run some clock and kick a field goal to put the game away.
Man, I hate the Patriots and Tom Brady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Awesome!
Yea, what's your favorite team?
Gotta go with the Bills!
Lots of Bills fans lately...
Dude, you're IN Buffalo
True that.
Yea, most people here are huge Bills fans!
Not me
Oh, who do you like?
Pats fan all the way brotha!
Pats are a joke!
Nah, they are invincible!
Okay Borris...
Borris?
Goldeneye reference.  That's his key phrase and you sounded just like him.
Oh!  Yea, I've never seen that movie
You should watch it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man? One more month with no football!
I know. I'm so happy it's almost back.
Who do you think is gonna win it all this year?
Oh, man. You know I'm going with the Falcons again.
Man! Last year was a fluke.
We shall see. We shall see.
I think the Cowboys are gonna make a run for it.
I can see that. Dak is sick!
No doubt. And Elliot.
And Dez!
Their offense is stacked, for sure.
Their defense, however... They're gonna need to step it up.
Yeah, especially when it comes to the playoffs.
Yeah, if they weren't playing at such a deficit against the Packers, they could have won.
True, true.
But, of course, the Falcons handled them!
And then got trolled in the Super Bowl!
Don't remind me!
28-3, man... Never forget!
Okay, I suddenly have to go! See you for the season opener!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite NFL team?
Not really. I don't watch much football.
Fair. I tend to root for the patriots but that's because I'm from Boston.
My dad's from Boston too. He roots for the giants.
That's so wierd.
Yeah. he was super happy during their superbowl faceoffs.
I can imagine! Nothing says defeat like an 18-0 season ending in a superbowl loss.
For sure. although I guess the patriots got their redemption this past year.
Yeah that was amazing. I definitely thought it was over in the third quarter.
Me too.
I actually was more impressed with the game a few years back against the seahawks.
Oh yeah -- the one with that weird play at the end that won it?
Yeah. I forget what it was exactly, but it was just such a fortuitous mistake on the seahawks part.
It definitely was an odd decision.
Are you looking forward to anything specific this season?
Not really. I really just use games as a chance to hang out with friends on sundays over food and drink.
Hah, yeah. It's definitely part of the culture.
Do you want to watch a game with me sometime?
Sure!
Great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best running back ever?
That's easy Emmitt Smith.
Why do you think it's Emmitt?
He holds all the records.
What records does he hold.
Emmitt has the all time touchdown record.
How many touchdowns did he have?
Emmitt Smith had 164 rushing touchdowns.
How many yards did he have?
Emmitt Smith had 18,355 yards rushing.
Wow, that's pretty good.
Emmitt also has a few other records.
Like what?
He has the most carries.
I bet that number is high.
Yeah, he had 4,409 carries.
Emmitt Smith was a beast.
Yeah he was the best running back of all time.
How old was Emmitt when he retired?
Emmitt was 35 years old when he retired.
XXXXXXXXXXX
9 weeks until the season starts.  I'm ready--Sunday tailgates here I come!
I'm right there with you, buddy.
So- what's your team?  Are you still a 49ers fan?
Oh hell no!  They lost me when Harbaugh left and Kaepernick was benched.
Yeah, they really blew that call.  That kid was really responding to Harbaugh.  They needed another coach who knew how to bring him along.  That kid is talented.
Yeah--pisses me off that the league is blackballing him.
Yeah, you gotta give it to that guy, though--he's sticking to his guns.
Yeah  You know who really impresses me is the Raiders QB Derek Carr.  That kid is great man--nothing but upside.
As long as they put an actual line in front of him this year.  That injury was gruesome.  Yo think he'll be ready for training camp?
I don't know.  The way the league tries to rush these guys back from an injury . . . I'm thinking RG3.
Yeah, that was majorly screwed up, man.  I'm pushing for the Steelers, myself.
Well, if Big Ben wants another ring, he'd better hurry.  He's getting a little long in the tooth, and he ALWAYS takes a beating.  Talk about a team that needs an O-line . . .
No kidding.  I know he's had some off-the-field problems in the past, but there's just something about that guy that I like.  You know, local boy, plays close to home.
Yeah, and he's really settled down since he got married and had kids.
What do you think of Green Bay?
I think all they got is Aaron Rodgers.  That's a pretty good "all", but he can't do it alone.
Yeah.  I'm just hoping someone will beat the friggin' Patriots.  That Belichick stinks on ice, man.  Is there any way to cheat that he hasn't thought of?
If there is, I'm sure we'll see it this season.  What a jerk!
Amen to that, Bro.  So, I'm saying Super Bowl--Steelers by 6 over Seattle?
Get outta town!  Raiders by 12 over Arizona!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cant wait for football season to start
I agree and its not just for the game, then it will be fall and we can get a break from this heat
Who is your favorite team?
I love the redskins
really, being from new england I would have assumed the Patriots were your team
They are my second, who is yours?
I love the cowboys
whew, as long as you dont say the giants
ya, I agree, even though they did really well last year
Redskins havent done much in a few years
I agree, I am hoping this year we will come back
Have you ever gone to the superbowl?
I havent, its too pricey for me
I agree, I also like being home with family and friends and watching it together
we should plan an event together for this year
Thats an awesome idea, maybe it will be redskins vs cowboys
That would be something
I will bring the wings
I will bring the beer
I cant wait
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about NFL losing more ads?
No, what happened?
Two of their major advertisers dropped out.
Wow, really? How come?
NFL ratings are tanking, it seems like. Either people aren't watching it or they're doing it and not watching the ads.
Well, we knew knew things like TiVo and the internet were gonna change. How's the NFL handling it?
More merch, I guess. I think they gotta get more exciting.
I mean, I don't know if you can get more exciting than last year's Super Bowl.
The comeback was amazing, but I think the fact that it was the Patriots left a sour taste in people's mouths.
Americans like the underdog.
That, and most of us are sick of Tom Brady.
I guess there aren't as many interesting teams any more.
There are some--I'd like a redemption story for the Falcons.
They had a really great season last year, despite their loss.
Yeah, they just choked at the end there.
Matt Ryan still their quarterback?
Yeah, him and Schaub. Both Matts though.
Mm. They don't really have any star players, I wouldn't say.
No, but they work together well as a team.
Well. Hopefully they can bring some fire back to the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did do you think the San Francisco 49ers made good decisions this off season?
I liked their draft picks a lot. I'm really excited about Solomon Thomas.
I am too! Don't forget they basically got Reuben Foster as a steal late in the 1st round.
I haven't forgotten. I'm really excited about Reuben Foster too. I think they're really going to solidify the 49ers defense this season.
They've struggled so much last season but I like the new editions to the team. I think General Manager Lynch has done a terrific job.
I can't believe how many good moves Lynch has made already. I didn't expect to be this excited after coming off such disappointing past seasons.
I know the last time they made the Superbowl with Jim Harbaugh coaching seems a distant memory away now.
Don't remind me. I still love Harbaugh and will always support him over Jed York.
Worse owner in the league! Hopefully he's stepping back this year and letting Lynch run the show and decision making.
Do you think coach Kyle Shanahan can bring the exciting offense that he orchestrated with the Atlanta Falcons here?
I hope so. I mean he doesn't have quite the offensive power and talent here that he has in Atlanta but I'm hoping he has a good eye to scout and bring in the talent necessary to run his offense.
Oh no doubt, imagine if we had Julio Jones and Matt Ryan passing to him, I'm sure we'd be right back in the talks about championship contention.
That would be a dream but we have to hope the offense shows some signs this year. It's been an offensively struggle the past few seasons.
I know former coach Chip Kelly was suppose to juice our offense up but we just never saw it. It's a shame because Chip is a really good offensive master mind.
I think with the distractions gone like Colin Kaepernick, we'll be able to have a well unified team. Hopefully team chemistry builds early.
The division is going to be tough with the Arizona Cardinals reloading and the Seattle Seahawks will never go away. I think the only team that hasn't really improved is the Los Angeles Rams.
The Rams are in a similar situation as we are. They don't really have a star player and their defense is strong but their offense out side of Todd Gurley is very suspect.
They do have Jared Goff with all that potential but he'll need more years and experience to possibly show that.
I think it'll be a fun year for our team as well as the season overall. Who do you think takes it all this year?
If I had to bet money, I'd always bet on the New England Patriots.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is going to be the breakout star this year in the NFL
I think you need to look at the rookie class for the next breakout star.
There are a lot of awesome rookie running backs this year
My money is on Leonard Fournette. 6'1" 240 and one of the fastest guys in the league
He's like a freight train running down the field.
I see him as being the next Bo Jackson.
He could easily rush for 1,500 yards this year, or he could easily fall prey to numerous injuries like he did in college
He only struggled with a few in college. I believe he'll play at least 15 games and finished first in the league in rushing
How do you think Christian McCafferty will do this year?
Where was he picked?
The Panthers took him 8th overall.
He's quick and can do everything with the ball. I like his game, but I don't see him being as good as Fournette
He's a different type of back. I can see him catching 80 passes while rushing 12 times a game.
In today's game that's just as valuable as a guy who carries it 25 times a game.
I would put money he has more touchdowns than Fournette
No way. Fournette will get all the goal line touches because he's so big
But McCafferty is so crafty. I can see him scoring in so many different ways.
Either way, I bet neither of them is as good as Elliot this year
That's true, but only because Elliot has the superior offensive line.
Both Fournette and McCafferty have awful offensive lines in front of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think are the top 10 running backs of all time?
All time? Or do you mean in recent history.
All time. The best ever.
Ok, easy, Jim Brown.
Yea, but Jim Brown is going to be everyone's number one.
Ok then, my number two pick would be Barry Sanders.
Yea! Barry Sanders was awesome.
Yes he was.
Ok who else?
Hmm, I guess Emmitt Smith.
Emmitt Smith was a beast.
Yea, and he can dance to.
What do you mean?
I think he won Dancing with the Stars.
No way! Really?
Yea, you should watch it on youtube or something.
That's funny. Hey what about Walter Payton?
Oh yea, I forgot about Walter. I might have to put him above Emmitt.
Yea I definitely put him before Emmitt.
Walter was amazing, plus I heard he was the nicest guy in person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the strongest division in the NFL?
That is a tough question. I guess I'd have to think about it division by division.
Well, the AFC East is out. The Patriots are strong of course, but there's really nobody else.
Fair. I'd say the AFC North could be a contender with the Steelers, Ravens, and Bengals. We can forget about the Browns!
Poor Browns. The AFC South could be a contender in some years, but not lately.
I agree. I think next year we should see some good things from the AFC West with the Chiefs, Broncos, and Raiders.
When I think of the NFC, it seems like each division has a couple good teams and a couple bad ones.
I can see that, but I think the NFC East and NFC North are both difficult divisions.
Well, you can't underestimate the NFC West either with the Seahawks and Cardinals.
I know, but the other two are so bad!
Fair point. I feel the the NFC East and the AFC North have the biggest rivalries.
I'd agree with that. You have Vikings/Green Bay, but I don't feel like all four are rivals as much as the Giants, Cowboys, Eagles, and 'Skins.
Then you take the AFC East. Where are the rivalries?
Well, the Pats have been so dominant for so long that it is hard to have a rivalry.
Do they even have one at all?
If anyone, I guess the Giants because of the two Super Bowls, or maybe the Broncos, but that's about it.
I think you might be right with the Giants. Ruining a perfect season does tend to create some hard feelings.
I still can't talk about it.
Even with this year's amazing comeback.
Even with that. The 2007 loss still hurts!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you ready for the next nfl season?
HECK YEAH I AM
Who you think will win the superbowl?
The Patriots
You suck you know that right?
Why?
Cuz Cam and the Panthers are gonna come back and win it!
Pshhh yeah right!
You know I'm right!
Naw Tom Brady and the Pats totally got this
What about the worst team?
It's been the Browns soooo
Yeah they do suck
I think they'll keep sucking
You're probably right
Just like I am right about the Patriots winning the Superbowl?
Nah that's totally wrong
You just mad bruh
Nah I'm just realistic!
Whatever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ready for the Patriots to win another Superbowl?
What!
You know it is gonna happen this season.
I know that the Patriots are a bunch of cheaters.
No way they are the best Football team in the NFL
I think the Steelers will destroy them.
Never we have Tom Brady the best quarterback in the whole NFL.
Oh no you are mistaken Ben Rothinsberger is so much better then Brady
Why would you say that.
Ben can actually take a hit if needed and not whiny like a baby.
Tom Brady never gets hit since the Patriots offense is so strong.
Really thats why he was complaining last year about them not protecting him.  At least Ben tries to run when theres an opening
oh no thats the side effect of not being able to throw this year since he blew his fingers of on a fourth of july party.
That was a fake news story.
sounds like something he would do.
No it was fake and he is an excellant quarterback.
Hes no Tom Brady and they are no where near as good as the Patriots.
Guess we will see since preseason is right around the corner.
Thats true we should take our families to a preseason game
Good idea the tickets are cheaper durning the preseason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Carolina Panthers will do this year?
Fairly decent.  I doubt they will return to the Super Bowl again.
How important is Cam Newton to the team?
He is very important.  He needs to cut down on turnovers and mistakes.
What about his receivers?
They are fair.  His best passing option is going to his tight end Greg Olsen.
Do you think the rookies will help out?
They should. Christian McCaffrey should help at back and receiver.  He seems really fast.
Yes he seems like he could play multiple positions.
Exactly.  Also with Cam Newton being so mobile they might run the option at times.
You think the option would work?
It doesn't seem to at times in the NFL. Miami tried it some in the past.
Yes, they had hit and miss success with the wildcat system.
However, I think Cam Newton is a bigger and faster player than what other teams have had when using it.
What about the Panthers defense?
I think Luke Kuechly is definitely the best or one of the best linebackers in the league.
Yes he definitely covers a lot of ground on defense.
Everything centers around his play. However he needs help in the secondary.
If the secondary plays well do you think they can return to the Super Bowl?
Probably not.  When they went to the Super Bowl two years ago I think they were just having really good luck in a lot of games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, both teams are still good, but maybe they will start to take a backseat soon.
Yea, I just do not see that happening with Bill Belichek.
Yea, he is a great coach, but eventually they could wear down I guess, right?
Yea, eventually, but they just seem too good.
Yea, Brady has a cannon for an arm.
Yea, he does, but they are built on more than just that.
Yea, do you actually think anybody could take them down this year?
No, I don't and especially not in their division.
Yea, Miami may complete this year, but not enough to take them down.
I agree. They have a good enough offense to complete, but they are not at the Patriots level yet.
I agree! Thats a much different level than they are on.
Yea, well not everyone can be the Patriots.
How about the Chiefs?
Eh, they just haven't been able to get over the hump. Its kinda sad.
Yea, I agree. Its tough, but thats Andy Reid for you.
Yea, he is a great coach, but he struggles when it means the most.
He does and its unfortunate, but it seems to be the normal.
Yea, I agree. Maybe one day he will figure it out.
Yea, time is running out though, right?
Yea, sorta, but he has a couple more years of coaching in him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mike zimmer is a great head coach
Who does he coach for?
The minnesota vikings
Oh, thats a great team
I agree
I love their stadium too
Which stadium is theres?
U.S Bank Stadium
Oh thats a good one
Yes it is
I want to go to one of their games someday
Me too
I bet it is exciting
It probably is
I also want to go to a panthers game
They are a great team too
Yes they are
One of my favorites
I love cam newton
He is great
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Super bowls did the Steelers win?
That would be six.
Wow, that's a lot.
Yes, that's my team.
I know. I remember the parties.
Black and yellow, one of my favorite songs.
Don't forget the Terrible Towel.
I have a bunch from going to the games.
Who is your favorite player?
I'd have to say now Antonio Brown.
Yeah, he's pretty good.
Terry Bradshaw was a great quarterback for them.
He was, what year was he still playing?
Not sure when he started. His last was 1983 though.
Is he in the Hall of Fame?
Yes.
They have a few Hall of Famers don't they?
Yes, and don't forget Mean Joe Greene.
I did forget about him.
I know my steelers. They're going to win this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Not a Ravens fan at all but they got a real good one in Baldwin.
I'm mad the Browns didn't get him.
He's a worker and was trained by the best.
I think he could fight his way on the field like Norwell last year for Carolina.
How did Michael Bennet fall so far in the draft?
I think it was a combination of his weight and lingering injury concerns. If a guy slips 10 spots in the first round you can chalk it up to some teams being dumb or missing out.
But all the teams passed up on him...
Then we have to take our homer glasses off and accept the possibility that they all saw something they didn't like.
Just goes to show you, even guys who truly believe they are not homers.
I try not to be blinded by the homer glasses.
I don't think it was homerism; these things happen sometimes.
Simply not a lot of need for the position.
Bennett will get his chance to shine for the Jags.
I guess his ability to embarrass offensive guards with his speed wasn't replicable in this draft.
C'mon man, that's the kind of homer talk we were just discussing.
Can't help it...
You also have to consider that Bennett had a hamstring problem that teams got to evaluate the combine.
And after all those teams pass, the players show up and end up starting
He wasn't flashy, but he put tailbacks on their butts behind the line of scrimmage with regularity last season.
I will say he was where he was supposed to be a lot of times. And that is all that counts
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what will the Patriots do to cheat this year?
Who knows...it's something every single year.
Definitely...I call them the Cheatriots and their coach is Bill Belicheat.
I love that...and couldn't agree more. Every one of their super bowl wins is tainted in my opinion.
And people who think Belichick is great are kidding themselves...he stinks without Brady.
Oh definitely. He was nothing with the Jets and nothing with the Browns.
The only player on that team that I like is Gronk.
I like him too...pains me to say I like a Patriot though!
Edleman isn't bad either...I don't know how they always find these little receivers with talent.
I know...him, Welker, Amendola...same types.
I'm personally hoping that someone...anyone...wins the AFC East but the Patriots.
I do to...same old same old every season.
And Brady claims he's going to play until he's 50.
He'll probably find  way to cheat his way into doing it.
That 4th quarter in the super bowl last season was amazing though.
I'll have to admit, it was. But I think the Falcons gave it away more than the Patriots won it.
Maybe the Jets will surprise everyone in the East this year.
Right...maybe I'll grow 3 feet by tomorrow!
Yeah, probably have about the same chance!
Exactly... but I do love the Jets so I hope they just don't embarrass themselves this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why didn't Randy Moss break all of Jerry Rices records?
Have you seen Jerry Rices records?
A few of them, but they seem breakable.
First, Jerry Rice played in the NFL for 20 years.  That's incredible.
How long did Randy Moss play?
I think it was 14 years but his last 2 years he really didn't play much.
Ok, so Jerry played 8 more years.  That's why Randy didn't break his records.
It's a factor, but let's look at some of Jerry's records.
Like which one?
Ok career receiving yards.  Jerry Rice had 22,895 yards.
What is second place for yards?
Terrell Owens with 15,934 and Randy Moss is 3rd with 15,292 yards.
That's a pretty big gap between first and second.
Let's look at career receiving touchdowns?
Ok, so how many did Jerry have?
Jerry Rice had 197 career receiving touchdowns.
Let me guess Terrell Owens is second?
No, Terrell is 3rd with 153 and Randy Moss is second with 156.
Dang, Jerry Rice destroyed the record book.
Yeah, see Randy Moss was great but Jerry Rice was almost a football god.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is favored to win the afc this year.
New England has to be favorites,right?
I believe they are.
As they should be.
I think they're favored every year.
Top flight organization.
Yes they are.
I believe New England has a 96.2% chance to make the playoffs and 92% chance to win the division.
The division should be a piece of cake for them.
It is a weak division.
The steelers are rated at a 75% chance for the playoffs.
They should make the playoffs.
I agree.
Then it drops down to a 56% probability for the raiders to make the playoffs.
Then everybody else is bunched together.
Who's predictions are these?
This is from ESPN.
They have New England at over a 50% probability of making it to the SUPERBOWL.
Wow,nice to be a New England fan.
Every year you have a great chance to make it to the SUPERBOWL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
Yes, I have been counting the months to go and Pre-season is about to start.
Who is your favorite NFL team this season?
Even though I do not have a home team I am excited to see what the Miami Dolphins will do this season.
What was the Dolphins record last year?
They were 10 and 6 for the season.
Who owns the Miami Dolphins?
Stephan Ross in the majority share holder but there are others owners for the team.
Have they won a Superbowl game?
Oh yes they have been to the Superbowl many times and have won a few.
Was Dan Marino the quarter back for the Dolphins?
He was a long time ago.
Who is the current quarteback for Miami?
Matt Moore is the current quarterback.
What is his standing in the NFL?
As far as I know he was a very good backup quarterback.
What year did Matt Moore enter the NFL?
He was undrafted, but the Cowboys signed him in 2007.
Do you see The Dolphins as a contender for the NFL Superbowl this season?
It's wishful thinking, maybe next year?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you as excited for the NFL season as I am?
You know it! I can't wait to see my Packers in action.
You think they have a shot to win it all this year?
Definitely! Aaron Rodgers is the best quarterback in the league. I think he can lead us to another Super Bowl.
You really think Rodgers is the best in the whole NFL?
Of course I do. Who would you put ahead of him?
Um, Tom Brady maybe? The greatest quarterback who ever played the game?
Brady's great and all, but he's almost 40! He's way too old.
Well, Brady didn't look too old in the Super Bowl against the Falcons.
Yeah, but it's a year later, and Father Time is still undefeated. I'd rather have the 33 year old quarterback than the 40 year old one.
Whatever. We'll just agree to disagree.
We'll settle it at the Super Bowl. If your Patriots even make it that far.
Who's going to beat us in the AFC? Name one team that has a realistic shot.
Pittsburgh, for one. Maybe the Raiders.
Pittsburgh can't beat us in the playoffs. And the Raiders are still too young to be a real threat.
Carr looks good though. I think he's the real deal at QB.
Fair enough. But who knows what he's going to be like coming back from that injury?
Yeah, that was so disappointing last year. I was really looking forward to a Raiders/Patriots matchup in the AFC championship.
Maybe we'll get to see it this year. And then we'll get to see the Pats and the Packers in the Super Bowl.
Man, that would be so sweet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the Pro Football hall of fame for 2017.
No I have not heard yet,  Who is in it this time?
So many good ones this year.  Very deserving!
When is it?
August 6th I believe.  Jerry Jones is gonna be in this year.
I heard his wife was going to be a presenter?
She sure is!  She will be only the 3rd wife to present to her husband.
Oh I remember when Farve wife did that last year.  I think it is a good idea.
I like to see the wives get some recognition and I think being a presenter is just the way.
Oh look here it says that Kurt Warner wife will also present this year to him.
That is such a good idea.  I really support that decision.
The Cowboys should have a good team this year dont you think?
Yea they really stacked the house with the draft.
Even with all the trouble they are having with some players I really think they will come out swinging.
I will not miss Tony Romo?  He was a good guy but couldn't quit geting hurt
I hear that everytime he went down I closed my eyes.
I think we will have a good season with Dak at the Quarterback position.
As long as he shows up like last year he will be good for our team.
I guess we will have to wait to see when it all gets going.
Lets plan a few season games this year.  Just let me know when you are free!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the NFL football season to start back?
I am, pre-season should be starting soon.
My favorite player was Peyton Manning.
Who was that?
Peyton Manning was one of the all time great players.
What position did Peyton play?
Peyton Manning played quarterback and set multiple records.
What team did he play for?
Peyton played the majority of his career at the Colts and won a superbowl with them.
What happened to him?
He had neck surgery towards the end of his career and was traded afterwards.
What team did Peyton get traded to?
Peyton was traded to the Denver Broncos.
How did Peyton do in Denver.
Peyton took the Broncos to the super bowl and won.
Is Peyton still playing?
Unfortunately he retired, but not until after winning another superbowl with the Bronchos.
Doesn't he have a brother?
Peyton Manning does have a brother that plays in the NFL as well.
I bet his dad is super proud?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is J.J Watt the greatest defensive player of all time?
At only 28 years old it is hard to say he is the greatest of all time.
He is a great player regardless.
I agree with you on that.
He didn't have great numbers in 2016 however.
Yeah he must be looking forward to improving this year.
I know I would want to put up some great numbers following a season like that.
He needs to get back to his 2014 mentality when he had nearly 21 sacks!
That was a great year for him.
Is he enough for the Texans to see success?
Can I be honest with you?
Yeah sure you can.
I don't know why the Texans didn't draft Manziel.
I totally agree with you!
He played so well for Texas A&M maybe he would have done well with a Texas team.
He just didn't fit well in Cleveland.
Yeah I wonder if he will ever be back in the NFL.
It can go either way honestly.
Hopefully we see him on a roster again soon.
Yeah he was amazing in college.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the NFL's rules?
I think they've gotten too restrictive over the past few years and I'm glad they're relaxing their stance a bit
True, the excessive celebration penalty is itself pretty excessive
I like seeing players celebrate, but I understand the reason for it
I don't like watching players on teams I don't like celebrate, like Antonio Brown on the Steelers
Sure but that doesn't mean that players shouldn't be able to celebrate more in general
I do think the celebrations have to be classy, and they can still be flashy
I wish they'd relax more on the goal post celebrations that Jimmy Graham popularized
They cracked down on that because he kept hitting the posts and making them have to readjust them
That one makes more sense, whereas other celebrations that don't disrupt the game should be left intact
Some players got away with a lot, like Marshawn Lynch grabbing his crotch as he jumped into the end zone
It may have been in bad taste, but I don't think most people would object to it on the grounds that it was entertaining
That's a good point, since the NFL is a source of entertainment, and it should be entertaining
Absolutely, and that's why those rules were getting out of hand
Some players have come up with iconic celebrations, like Victor Cruz doing a salsa dance in the end zone
Man I miss Victor Cruz dancing in the end zone
Me too, and I hope he does really well on the Bears, even though I'm not a huge Bears fan
It's fine to be a fan of a player even if you aren't a fan of the team they're on
Case in point, Jimmy Graham, who went from the Saints--one of my favorites--to the Seahawks, my least favorite team!
Maybe they just have better goal posts in Seattle that are harder to knock out of alignment
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the last Superbowl?
Yes I did It was a fun Superbowl.
I know, I dont think Ive seen a more exiting Superbowl that last years.
Where did you see it?
I was with a couple of friends at my apartment and just had like a little party.
Oh thats cool, so were you rooting for an espefic team?
I was, I wanted the Patriots to win so badly.
Im guessing you were pretty happy with the outcome then!
I was it was a great comeback, did your support a particular team?
No, not really I just wanted to watch the game but was exited to see that comeback.
I know it was pretty cool, we were all down becaues we thought that Patrios were going to lose.
Well It was a hard feat, I dont think many teams have recovered from that and win.
I think its the only team that has done that feat.
I like that they never gived up althought things were lost.
I know, I couldnt believe it when they won.
Im guessing the party got a lot better.
Yeah we had a great time the comeback inspired us all.
Do you think the Patrios will do well this season?
I dont know, I ve heard they hired good players this years so they might repeat the titlle.
I think that they have the potential but the competition is pretty hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who's your team this year?
in what sport?
the n f l.
oh, i will always like my steelers.
man, you're nothing but a homer.
that terrible towel is the truth my dude.
i never did like the steelers.
why you hatin'?
not hatin', just don't like them.
well who's your team this season?
i'm riding that raider train again.
again?
i called for them to make some noise last season.
they went what, twelve and four?
yeah, but carr got hurt and their playoff chance was zero.
i know that's right.
if he stays healthy this year they can deal with the patriots.
i hate the patriots.
why?
because all they do is win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Tom Brady is a better quarterback now then Joe Montana was?
I'm a huge 49ers fan and a huge Montana fan so it's hard for me to honestly say yes, but I have to say yes.
I was thinking about this the other day and it's hard to argue against Tom Brady being the best quarterback ever now.
How can you really argue against it? He's won 5 Superbowls. He's been Superbowl MVP 4 times. He's been league MVP 2 times. Those are stellar merits.
I guess the only argument you could make is that he lost Superbowls.
Oh don't remind me about the Eli curse.
He's 7-2 in the Superbowl. So, you have to take into the account of times he's appeared as well as the number of victories.
Joe Montana has won 4 Superbowls and was named Superbowl MVP 3 times. Joe's also 4-0 in the Superbowl. Undefeated.
That's true. I think that's the argument you could make that Joe Montana is better than Tom Brady but it's hard to overlook Tom's achievements.
I've heard people say that Joe had Jerry Rice so it made life easier for him.
While that's true that Joe Montana did have Jerry Rice he also played in an era where quarterbacks weren't protected like they are now.
That's right. You could argue that his career could have been longer if he had the same rules that protect quarterbacks today like Tom Brady.
Exactly, I think that's an argument you could have with someone about who's the greatest quarterback of all time when it comes to comparing Brady with Montana.
It makes for an interesting discussion but I still find it tough to not say Tom Brady is the best.
There really isn't much of a strong case to be made but it's not beyond debating.
If you factor in their games and moments, it just seems like Joe has had a lot of classic moments.
Which is surprising because in today's time with the TV, internet, and social media exposure, I feel we have seen everything Tom Brady has done.
While that's correct, I think all of Tom Brady's highlights on the field don't measure and compare to Joe Montana's.
Right, if we just compare highlights I would say Aaron Rodgers has more impressive highlights than Tom Brady but Tom Brady is overall the better if not the best quarterback of all time.
I can't wait to have this debate 10 years from now about who the next great quarterback is to compare with Tom Brady after he retires.

What in a game drives you crazy?
Constant commercials and TV time-outs.
Well, duh. Everyone hates that.
Ask a silly question, get a silly answer.
Fine, what about gameplay annoys you the most?
Icing the kicker.
You mean when coaches call a timeout right as a field goal kicker attempts a kick?
Yup!
Why do you hate it?
It makes the game even longer, and it doesn't work?
It doesn't?
Nope, statistics show that the kickers aren't affected.
Don't they panic and re-think the kick and then mess up?
No, they get more time to re-think the angle.
Do they try to make it even if they know it's coming?
Yup. If they miss it, they make an adjustment. If they make it, they repeat it and they got a free practice kick.
What's the percentage of icings that work?
I'm not sure, but logic disproves it.
How?
If it works, it's chance. It can work sometimes and the coach is a genius; if it doesn't work he's an idiot.

I was looking at Fantasy Football strategy for this year and it's hard to tell who are the top running backs in the NFL this year.
I haven't looked at anything. I would guess that Ezekiel Elliott is the top running back.
He's projected to be. Hard to not have big numbers behind that big offensive line and with the talent he has.
Wonder if he will go for 25 or more touchdowns.
Possibly. That's one and a half a game. Pretty tough to do, but a game with three here and there, and possible.
I'm trying to think of more running backs. Wow, who else is still out there that produces. LeVeon Bell is the only other one that comes to mind.
LeVeon Bell is definitely a big numbers producer. Especially if he's healthy.
He's had a hard time staying healthy. The Steelers run him to death.
They certainly do. He may not last another 3 or 4 years.
Probably not. I can't think of any other running backs.
There is Jay Ajayi from Miami and David Johnson from Arizona.
I would be a little wary of picking those two because they seem like one year wonders, especially on a team like Miami or Arizona.
True. Arizona running backs are usually fantasy busts.
Yes, they are. Remember that running back they had a few years ago that everyone thought was the real deal and he flopped.
Andre Ellington, right?
Yes, him. He was high on everyone's draft board.
He wouldn't be the first running back to be a waste of a pick.
Certainly not. Who else is high on that list?
Jordan Howard is top ten.
The guy from the Bears?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think will win the NFC division in 2017?
That's a hard question to answer there are so many good teams.
I know but if you had to narrow it down.
Well Atlanta obviously since they won the division last year.
Yeah despite the meltdown in the Superbowl I still expect them to be good this season.
That game was kind of a fluke. They went up early and got careless. Only the Patriots could have made that comeback.
Yeah it was a crazy game. Besides Atlanta who else do you think has a chance?
The Cowboys for sure.
What? The Cowboys. You really think they have a chance?
Did you watch them at all last season?
Yeah I watched their playoff game against Green Bay which they lost.
Barely lost. If they would have won I think they may have been able to beat Atlanta.
I don't know about that. What makes you think they will be better this next season?
There offense will be at least as good or better than last season.
Yeah but what about there defense?
They drafted defense very heavy and picked up some solid players.
You think a squad of rookies can carry a defense?
They still have some solid veterans like Sean Lee in the mix.
Yeah that guy was really good in the games I saw him play in.
He is one of the cornerstones for their defense. If the rookies can play a part the Cowboys can make a playoff run.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, you thinking of attending any NFL games this season?
Yeah! I was thinking of going to a Rams vs. Seahawks game. You know those always end up pretty good.
How do you think Goff will do with a new head coach?
He should do pretty good this season! Mcvay is said to be an offensive guru.
True, i mean look at the Redskins in the past seasons, he made kirk cousins looks like an all star.
How about you? Thinking of flying out to NY to catch a giants game this season?
Yeah, i want to. Eli is getting older and i want to catch him which hes still doing well.
You think they can win the division this season?
Yeah, I think Dak and Zeke will his a sophmore slump, Redskins lost their offensive mind to your Rams, and Phily is a joke.
Haha, we will see. I can see Dak taking a step back now that teams have studied him some, but not Zeke.
We will see. Dallas DOES have a pretty good line, any half decent back can get a 1000 yard season runnning behind them.
Speaking of good lines, Lynch to Oakland might be pretty good to watch.
Yeah, that should be pretty fun to watch. Oakland has probably the best line in the league right now.
Plus, you have a well rested beast of a running back playing for his hometown. Talk about motivation.
Seriously. You think they'll win it all before they move to Las Vegas?
They might. They have one of the best offenses in the league right now, and they have the defensive MVP mack so they might.
Man, that MVP was robbed from Von Miller.
Well, you know how the league works, I think that Miller was slightly better but Mack got it because of the team records.
Probably true, but Oakland looks lethal and could win it all next season.
Yeah, they finally got some playoff experience last season, and i hope they lose again in their first round this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen the national tv schedule for this coming nfl season?
no not yet. why, what's up?
they got some good games hitting the airwaves right off the bat.
well i know the chiefs and patriots are the first game of the season.
yeah, and then opening monday night you got saints vikings and chargers broncos.
man. chargers broncos is gonna be lame.
why you say that?
who is denver's quarterback?
i don't know.
exactly. and phillip rivers might be on the down-slide.
well week two you got patriots saints on cbs early game.
now that should be a good one. drew brees is still a gunslinger.
end of september you got raiders washington for the sunday night nbc game.
if kirk cousins plays like he did two seasons ago, that might be a good one.
i think cousins still has some gas in the tank.
well he should. i think this is the season that he will be playing for a contract.
i know right. ain't this the second year in a row the skins slapped that franchise tag on him.
i think so.
they just messing up a dude's bread.
you know. watch him mess around and get hurt this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about those Kansas City Chiefs?
I know, it was a good game last night.
Did you see Alex Smith throw all of those passes?
Yes, I believe he threw for 363 yards.
Yes, the Chiefs rush game wasn't too strong.
Yep, I think Spencer Ware led the team with 70 yards.
San Diego didn't play too bad either.
Yes, Philip Rivers had a QB rating of 81.9.
Do you know how many yards Rivers threw for?
Yes, it was around 243.
As a matter of fact, what was Smith's QB rating.
His was lower than Rivers at 61.4.
Yes, Smith got sacked several times too.
Yea, it was three times to be exact.
The Chiefs' blockers will have to do better protecting the QB next time.
Yep, I think the Chargers defense was just too strong for them.
Do you remember what the final score was?
The Chiefs won 33 to 27.
Okay, good. I can't wait for the next game.
Yes, I think it will be an exciting match up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's confusing?
Um.. many things I reckon.
Why are there so many officiating people in football?
It's a complicated game. There is no way one person can watch all the players.
Yeah, but do we need 8?
Well We have the referee.
Guy who wears the R. Yes. He does the genral supervision and annoucements etc
He's the final authority on the decision. And he's the one who calls the foul on the passer
And umpires do what? They also stand in the backfield. They changed it from being behind defensive side to offensive side
Umpires checks the offense blocks and the defense warding off the blocks. And also checks the illegal moves forward in passing plays and
And the head linesman check the srimmage fouls?
Yes, he's the one who calls illegal movements in front and marks the forward progress of the ball, which is why they're now called the down judge
line judge opposite of the headsman is what?
he assist the down judge or headman in doing his job. Looks for illegal movements, out of bounds, count the num,ber of players
Too many men on the field is his call?
Yep. And then there are judges. Field judge, side judge,back judge
Field judge does the pass interference, illegal blocks, imcomplete passes etc?
Yes. he's on the same side aas th line judge except on the defense side.
And the side judge is the opposite of the field judge and do the same thing?
Yep, and the back judge too, except he covers the middle.of the field. See all these officials are thoroughly needed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
The New England Patriots will continue to be favorites so long as Tom Brady is under center and Bill Belichick is on the sidelines.
The Pats should be glad to finally have the Commissioner off their backs, eh?
I think being rid of that nuisance will help the Pats a great deal.
Are the Seahawks still a top-notch outfit?
With Pete Carroll as coach they are always in the mix, but the team lacks discipline and self-awareness.
Can the Chiefs get over the hump?
Andy Reid needs to have a Tony Dungy-type moment for that to happen. Kansas City has the pieces in place, but every part of the team needs to elevate its performance.
How will the Raiders do as slow-motion lame ducks?
I think attendance will be fine in Oakland, not like it was in Houston when the Oilers were winding things down. With Carr, Lynch and Del Rio, things will be interesting, provided Carr's injury doesn't linger.
How about the Rams? Can they improve?
They have a desirable attendance problem: they have too many fans coming to the games. The new uniforms are nice, but not as attractive as the royal blue and golden yellow garb people were asking for. But as a football team they have little to offer.
How will the Chargers fare in their new digs?
The small stadium might be a useful experiment for the NFL, but I think the Chargers still have an identity crisis. Some players are unhappy with the move from San Diego, and what looms after the small stadium experience is playing second fiddle to the Rams. What is their to really look forward to?
Are the Cowboys for real?
No, they are the same team they've been for many years. They won't live up to the hype until they tone down the hype. If Prescott stalls and Elliott is disciplined, then what?
Can the Falcons repeat their success of a year ago?
Unlikely. Losing the biggest game of all the way they did will hurt, and the new stadium will be a distraction, not a boost.
Who is a sleeper contender?
The Washington Redskins. They keep inching forward out of the morass that Daniel Snyder mired them in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched much football lately?
Yeah I been paying attention to it intently
You like whats going on so far?
The NFL has had a good offseason
Yeah there has been like no arrests
I agree maybe the players are getting better.
Speaking of getting better, how do you like Carson Wentz this year?
He actually has guys to throw to.
Who do you think will be his biggest target?
I think Agoholor will have alot of improvement.
I dont know hes really bad
Yeah but hes going to feed off the competition
I think Torrey Smith is done
Yeah his career went quick.
He might get cut in camp.
I wouldnt be shocked
They already cut Green Beckham
That guy was a waste of talent.
They should be markedly improved over last year
I see it happening
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up man?  You ready to watch the nfl?
Sure am!  Too bad you don't have any team to root for now.
Yeah I know, the Chargers left San Diego this year.  They're they LA Chargers now...
I know right.  It must kinda suck for you since you were a big fan.
Yeah, I don't know if I'll root for them. I'll probably watch a few games.
Well it's basically the same team.  Rivers, Gates and crew.
Your'e right, but it still hurts because I really invested a lot of my time and money as a fan.
Well maybe let's change the topic, who do you think will win it this year?
I don't know, I think the Patriots have a good shot this year.
Really?  I thought you hated them.
I kinda do, but I can't pretend they aren't really good.  Brady looks like he isn't slowing down at all.
I guess.  I think the Packers are gonna win it all.
Really?  They've been one and done for how many years now?
Sure, but I think they're due this year.  Aaron Rodgers has been playing great lately.
Yeah, he's totally been really solid.  Who knows.  The Cowboys are looking strong this year too.
Definitely, although too bad about the Romo situation, I really like the guy but he keeps getting hurt.
Yeah, feel bad for the dude but his time is up now.  Time for a new leader for the team.
Hopefully some new team emerges this season.  Pats going all the way again will be kinda of boring.
Really?  I think seeing a dynasty take over everyone is good for everbody.  It creates someone to really root against

XXXXXXXXXXX
When you were growing up, did you have a favorite NFL coach?
I think coaches are usually overrated. But I liked Tom Landry.
I remember Tom Landry. He's the one that always wore a fedora hat. I don't remember what happened to him.
When Jerry Jones bought the team, he fired Tom Landry.
That must've made a lot of people mad.
It did for a while, but Jerry Jones hired Jimmy Johnson and they started winning.
Do people think Jimmy Johnson was the reason they started winning? I wonder what it was that he did.
They drafted a bunch of young players, pretty much started from scratch.
That must've been when they hired Troy Aikman.
Yeah, they drafted a bunch of players around that time that went on to become Hall of Famers.
I remember they beat the Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl.
I remember that game, the Buffalo Bills went to four straight Super Bowls. They never could win one though.
Was that when Emmitt Smith was rushing for the Dallas Cowboys?
Yeah, Dallas drafted Emmitt Smith about the same time as Troy Aikman.
I think they got Michael Irvin at the same time as well.
Troy Aikman, Emmett Smith, and Michael Irvin. Are they all in the Hall of Fame?
All three of them. Emmitt Smith was the last one to be inducted.
Emma Smith, one of the greatest running backs ever. I seem to remember he played a few seasons in Arizona.
I think he went on to Arizona when he should've retired. He must've hated to stop playing.
Haven't heard much about Emmitt Smith since he retired. Out of the three, the one I see the most is Troy Aikman as an announcer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch the NFL opening game?
Yes I am I'm so excited
What about the hall of fame game?
Who is playing?
I believe it's the cowboys versus the cardinals
Both of those teams have a good chance to win
I agree with you on that, it will certainly be interesting
I really hope the cowboys win, they are one of my favorite teams
I think they have a good shot
It will be interesting to see how it all ends up
I wonder if wall the starters are going to play
Most likely not because it's before The season
Yeah I think the coaches may be wise not to start their best players yet
They want to avoid injuries
Yes, because afterall, the game doesn't really matter
It's just another way for the NFL to make money off the players
Yep I totally agree.
Well then it kind of seems immoral when you put it that way.
That's why I actually think I will not be watching this year
I agree, we should both wait to watch until the regular season
XXXXXXXXXXX
who you like this season?
what you mean?
pro football my dude.
oh, i like the eagles this season.
to do what?
to win the division.
man, you're crazy.
don't think so. remember, they started off five and oh last season.
that was last season.
dude, this year they've added some weapons.
i still think the n f c east belongs to the cowboys.
man, get off their jock.
naw, dallas gone be the truth again.
whatever homie. my birds gone do some things.
we'll see.
i like the eagles and i like tampa bay this season.
i like tampa bay too.
no doubt.
i just can't wait for things to get started.
training camp's in two weeks my dude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Patriots, cheaters or not?
I think they are.
Bill Belichick can't be trusted to do the right thing.
There have just been too many suspicious actions about the Patriots.
Winners?  I guess cheating does pay off in the end.
They are competitive every year.
There was spying, deflate gate, anything else?
There was PEDs gate where they gave several players PEDs.
Did not remember that one.
And IR gate where they illegally used the injured reserve list to keep on players who weren't hurt.
Were they punished?
Yes, they lost a draft pick.
It seems like losing draft picks never hurts them.
I guess that tells you how important the draft is.
Yes, bad teams always draft high but most of the time still stay bad.
Patriots have been picking late and losing picks yet still always finish near the top.
It is all because of the cheating.
Cheating pays!
I really think the cheating part has been overblown they are still talented.
A great deal of their success had to do with Brady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man the old players are getting bad
Like who
Like Tony Romo
He's not that bad
Uh
What
Come on your joking right
No I'm serious
He is on the decline
And?
Means he's not good
He is helping them win
I guess
No he is still their key
Whatever you say
Well I'm just being truthful
Maybe
Nah I am
I disagree

Hello!
Hello!
I didn’t see you I the field. Where had you been?
I was watching the game from the right side. I hope you enjoy it.
Oh, yes I did. It was a keenly contested game. There was excitement all through. Wasn’t it?
Yes, you’re right. Until the game was over it was difficult to forecast which team would win.
Yes, I too thought the game would end in a draw.
On the whole it was a clean game. There was no foul charge on either side.
What are you doing after the game?
I am going to a buddy's house to celebrate the win.
Is your buddy a Seahawk's fan?
Yeah, he will like anyone whose a Seahawk Fan.
Great, I actually got a Lynch Jersey I can wear to over there.
Ah ha that's a good one.
You excited about the next game?
Yeah, but I won't be able to make it to the next game.
Why not?
I have something for work and my boss isn't a Seahawks fan.
That's too bad, we'll have fun at your buddy's.
Sounds good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow American football?
I do. I love it.
Have you ever been to a game before?
I have only been to one.
Who was playing?
It was the Colts versus the Texans in Indianapolis.
Nice. Who ended up winning?
The Texans won. The crowd was pretty upset.
I'm guessing you're a Colts fan, then?
I actually am not a fan of either teams. I got free tickets and I lived in Indiana at the time.
You're not a fan of the team in your state?
I grew up closer to Chicago. I was raised a Bears fan.
Nice. The bears have had a really rough time lately.
They have. A lot of people blame Cutler.
I know. I don't think he can totally be blamed for it, though.
That's true. Their offensive line does a very poor job of protecting him.
You're absolutely right. He seems to take more hits than any other quarterback.
He also seems to be injured less.
He does. Poor guy.
I think it's time for them to make some major lineup changes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to take home MVP this year?
Well.. it depends..
Depends on what?
On who if Colin Kaepernick gets on a decent team.
Okay, not counting Kaepwenick, who do you think?
I don't know, you go first.
I think Joe Flacco will get it.
Seriously? Joe Flacco?
Yeah man, the Ravens are legit.
I guess.
Well? Who do you pick?
Okay.. I think it will be Jameis Winston.
Jameis Winston?
Yeah.
You pick Jameis Winston and you have the nerve to criticize my choice?
Let's just agree to disagree.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And besides, Tom Brady is going to win anyway.
Yeah right, you wish.
I don't have to wish. He's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Falcons Vs Dolphins, what are your thoughts?
Well, i'm a Dolphins fan but the Falcons are on the rise.
I know people say "Pre-Season doesn't count" but i feel it's just as imporant.
i think the same way. It's how they shake out the weak players.
True.
Now Atlanta pretty much has the same team as last year.
Miami is in the same boat.
So team-wize it's pretty much equal.
I would say so, i havent really looked at their draft pics.
Dont forget the free agents.
Also, true..... free agents seem to be more prevelant lately.
Yeah, and that's not cool either..... it's like being your own lawyer.
HA ha, that is so true.
serious tho.
So back to game one.....
Yes, i'd like to say Miami but i got a feeling it will be Atlanta by 7
Really?
Yes, based on the stats from last season.
Sigh, i hope your wrong. I want Miami to have a good year.
Me too, me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team that made the playoffs last year do you think will miss them this year?
I think that the Atlanta Falcons are in for a rough season.
Really? They were just in the superbowl!
Yeah, I don't think they have added much during the offseason to change any outcomes.
I think that you're right about the offseason additions, but I'm more worried about if they can shake that superbowl loss.
It would definately be a tough thing to go through, losing a 25 point lead late in the game, but I think enough time will have passed.
You do realize that the Falcons have a history of not bouncing back, right?
I do know that they rarely have two good seasons back to back in recent history, but this team is well-rounded and they didn't lose many players to other teams.
It's just that Matt Ryan is so talented, but the defense and offense don't always play well in the same games.
That's how it is for a lot of teams, though. Ryan is an elite quarterback.
He is one of the more talented in the NFL, but I think there needs to be some successes in his career before calling him elite.
Yes, now that they have the brand new stadium in Atlanta, it's important to bring a new chapter of success to the franchise.
I think their division is a toss up this year. So many teams could be contenders.
That's why I think they might not make the playoffs, it depends on how Carolina performs and if Tampa wins a few more this year.
We are forgetting about the biggest wildcard of them all, the Saints!
Yeah, the Saints had the most offensive yards in 2016 of any team in the league. Drew Brees is a monster on offense.
It could be a four way race most of the season, considering Atlanta and New Orleans both have such explosive offenses.
That's so true, but the falcons have an insanely better defense than the Saints.
I don't know if Atlanta's defense is as good as Tampa Bay's though, they kept Tampa in so many games this year.
I think their defenses stack up nicely together, but it will make for some good division game watching this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you an NFL fan?
Of course what red-blooded american male isn't?
Without being to sexist - I have to agree.
And yet there are a huge number of female NFL fans too these days though.
Yeah I think I read an article about how that is a huge growing market for the NFL - women fans.
Yeah until Goodell did everything imaginable to bust that.
Do you have a favorite team?
I do I love the Patriots.
Think they have a shot at repeating this year?
I think every year Brady stays healthy - they will have a shot until he decides to retire.
I might agree for the next 2-3 years - not that they will win the SuperBowl, but they will be near at the end.
I will admit - I was about to turn off the SuperBowl last year, when they started to makle their comeback.
My daughter had already gone to bed, so I get it. It was an amazing Brady comeback.
I know - he should have retired...its impossible to top that.
Five SuperBowl rings... the most of any player - never mind a quarterback
Yeah I think some defensive player gas 5 also and thats it.
You have to give him props and admire his talent and skill.
Thats nice to hear from a non Patriots fan.
I know I should hate him as a Bronco fan, but you just cant.
Any man should hate him! Talk about having it all... career, money..and hot wife to boot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Lions ever win with Matt Stafford?
I think its crazy but no.
Do you think hes just an average quarterback?
I dont but he hasnt shown hes a leader
You dont think its just a franchise thing?
Part of me thinks it is because they have had no luck
They had chances to win early on but Jim Schwartz did not know how to coach
I think thats evident in his time as DC in Philly
Yeah and so I think they wasted his prime years
Hes not awful he did throw for 5000 yards in one season
I would rather have Matt Ryan
What about Jameis Winston?
I think hes the next big quarterback in the NFL
Yeah I tend to echo that same sentiment.
Do you think he can be an MVP?
Yes and maybe even this year.
He has a lot of weapons now.
The addition of Desean Jackson is going to help him immensely.
Just have to hope Doug Martin can stay healthy
I doubt they are counting on that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it time for some football yet?
Not exactly, we still have some waiting to do!
I can not wait to watch my Los Angeles Chargers!
Do you think they will be a playoff team this year?
Not sure about that; but I can always hope!
I think the roster is pretty talented when you look at it.
We have some holes to fill; but so do most other teams as well.
Are there any players that you are excited to watch?
I really think Joey Bosa is a special talent.
Is he the defensive end from Ohio State?
Yes, he was outstanding for the buckeyes in his time there.
Well, he may be the player that turns the Charger's defense into an elite one.
I hope so! I feel like as long as we have Phillip Rivers we will have a chance.
There is no doubt about that. He has been a special player for that organization.
So what team do you cheer on?
I have always been a Washington Redskins fan.
Kirk Cousins has been really good for your team.
Yea, nobody really expected him to be so good.
Josh Norman was a great addition to your defense.
I know! I was so happy when we got him from Carolina.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey whats up?
Not much, how about with you.
Just counting the weeks until some NFL football.
I hear you, can't wait to see what the Patriots do this season.
I know right, I'm wondering if they are going to make it to the superbowl.
They did pretty good last year.
Yes, I believe they ended the year 14 and 2.
They even beat the Broncos. The same Broncos who took the superbowl last year.
Yeah I think the score to that games was 16-3
That right.
Ha, Ha, you just never know who is going to win.
Tell me about it.
This year the Patriots drafted Derek young from the Titans.
What position does he play?
I think he is a linebacker, but there is a lot of versatility to him.
That's always a good plus for any player.
Yes. Versatility players have a longer career in football; they add value to the team and can step up when needed.
I know that's right. Once you are not good in your one position anymore; see you.
From what I understand this Rivers has a lot of strengths and only a couple of weaknesses.
And we know that thoses weaknesses can be correct.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you collect any sports paraphernalia?
Actually I do! I'm a big Pittsburg Steelers fan.
What kind of stuff do you collect?
Well, lots, I've got a few jerseys.
Any favorites?
Maybe Ben Roethlisberger's? I wear it when I watch playoff games.
Anything else?
Basically anything I can get my hands on. Bumper stickers, T-shirts...
So basically everything.
Yeah. I'm a huge fan.
This makes me feel less alone.
Do you collect NFL paraphernalia?
Some.
Like what?
I own every Oakland Raiders jersey for the current team.
That is a lot.
And most of the past ones they sell.
This is starting to sound excessive.
I can't help it! I'm a big fan!
Well, I guess I can't fault you for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Tom Brady the best ever?
He might be the best QB ever
What about the best player?
It might not be him. There are too many variables
I think maybe Joe Montana has had a better career
He is one of the best for sure
Is he better than Brady though?
I think so
That is hard to say though
Right because they are different eras
Tom Brady is the best QB of this era
I agree with that
But, Peyton Manning is pretty good too
I forgot about him
He is a great player
I think he did not play that great in his last game though
Yeah, the defense won that title
Agreed
I wonder if he will come out of retirement
No chance

Who is your prediction to win it all this year?
Sadly, I say the patriots
Really? how come?
The improved so much this offseason. Plus they have the best QB of all time.
I know they got Stephon Gilmore and Brandin Cooks, but they lost their best RB
Legarette Blount was good, but it seems like anyone can be a RB in that offense.
Brandin Cooks was a huge addition.
I agree, Brady hasn't had a top WR threat since Randy Moss
Oh well we all know how that went we he played for them!
Undeafeated until the super bowl if I remember correctly.
Darn Eli Manning wasn't having none of that undefeated juice
Yeah that was a tough break for them, Brady has won many more since then
He may get one more now that he has Edelman, Gronk, and Cooks to throw too.
I am eager to see how their running game works.
Blount had 18 touchdowns so it is going to be hard to replace that much production
I agree, I do not think they got a certain guy to replace him with
Perhaps runningback by committe is what they will use
A lot of teams have turned to that, sucks for fantasy football
Cooks to the patriots is good for fantasy football
Not for the dolphins, bills and jets though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best NLF team this year?
I think the Falcons.
The Atlanta team?
Yes.
Why do you say that?
The have good returning players.
Right, and they always keep a healthy team.
I think the lack of injuries for that team always gives them a leg up.
Unlike the Texans.
Do they get a lot of injuries.
Yes, one of their star players was out.
Who?
JJ Watt.
Oh, well I think all the teams make a lot of injuries.
It is the name of the game.
Do you think the Texans have a change this year?
I think they do, they seem to get better every year.
They are more or less a new team.
Right, and soon they will establish themselves as a good team.
I just hope they can hold on to the star players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for football?
Yes I can't wait!
Who's your team?
Cardinals
Yeah they are awesome!
Hope they make it to the Super Bowl this year.
Who's your favorite player?
I loved Washington but we let him go.
I love Larry.
Yes Larry is a great player.
What do you think of coach?
Coach is the best!
The team always seems to be a TEAM.
They are very in tune with each other
Who is the team you dislike the most?
I hate the Seahawks, you?
I hate the Raiders.
Yeah they are a dirty team often.
One more month until preseason.
WOOO HOOO!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the NFL season?
No, I am not really a sports fan, but the rest of my family are rabid fans.
Oh, that's right, doesn't your Aunt adore the Vikings?
Yes. She passed away two months ago and we had her Vikings hat and an autographed, hand written letter from her favorite Viking on display at the wake.
That's sweet. You should watch a game in memory of her.
I would consider going to the new stadium, I hear it's really beautiful.
Do you know anyone who has been there?
Yes. Every year my cousins pool their money and buy season tickets and rotate who gets them for each game.
Cool.
The very first game that was played there was a pre-season game against the Packers.
The Vikings arch rivals!
Yes. And my cousin Jimmy had first go at the tickets this year.
Did he like the game?
He didn't see it, but yes, he LOVED the game.
What do you mean?
There was such a high demand for tickets since it was the first ever game in the new stadium and it was against our arch rivals he sold the tickets and pocketed $16,000.
WOW!
I don't know how anyone can afford to see a pro game of any sport these days.
I know, the prices are outrageous.
Thank God for farm teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just got my season tickets for the Dallas cowboys.
I can't believe you bought season tickets. The cowboys suck.
Well the steelers haven't had much to brag about these days.
Just wait - they're going to turn things around this season.
Sure. And Tom Brady didn't under inflate those footballs.
Man the Pats sure got off easy over that.
Yeah. You'd think the Browns or Green Bay would try it.
I don't think anything would help the Bengals.
What's up with them? They make crappy draft picks!
Well at least that's one thing Dallas does well. I have to give em that.
And with Romo at the helm, it's gonna be another great season.
But Dallas is a one-man team. If romo gets hurt, it's all over
That's the problem with too many teams today - they have one star player instead of building a real team.
I don't know how the Pats can stand Brady getting all the attention.
Colin Kaepernick is just as bad.
Man you'd think he'd focus on the game instead of getting involved in stupid media shit.
Face it, Seattle hasn't been the same since the Steve largent days.
You got that right. I'd give anything for a Warren Moon type of QB.
Well at least the Cowboys still have Thor best cheerleaders in the league v
That's about the only good thing I could say about the Fallas Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL teams do you think have the best logos?
I think that the Cowboys star is iconic.
It's only iconic because there's a lot of Cowboy fans that say its iconic.
I'm not a Cowboy fan, but you have to admit, the logo is iconic. I personally don't like their color scheme regardless.
I think the Browns probably have one of the worse color schemes and logos. I don't understand it.
I don't either. It's so boring.
Yeah, it's just a color. The helmet is orange.
That's what makes it even worse. It doesn't make any sense.
I do think that the Rams have a pretty cool helmet.
I guess, but it looked better when it was yellow and blue. These days, their color scheme is gold and dark blue.
Yeah, I don't like their color scheme either. I wish they would go back to their old colors.
The Cardinals also have a pretty boring logo. It's just a bird.
Yeah, I'm not a fan of it. That's another team with a logo and concept that makes no sense.
I think it's because the team moved from St. Louis where a Cardinal name and logo makes more sense.
I wish more teams would just change their names when they change cities.
Sometimes it's just too much money.
I think that's part of the reason some fanbases never get into their teams. Franchises don't take pride in relating to the city.
Yeah, I agree with that.
Personally, I think I just don't like the logo of any team that isn't mine.
At least you can be honest about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is pretty amazing that Pete Carroll has been able to sustain a contender in Seattle.
Yea, that has been nothing short of amazing. He has done a good job.
Yea, he is tough on his players and committed to winning.
Well, it was always the same at USC.
Yea, but that doesn't always translate. We find that out often right?
Yea, we sure do! Especially with Chip Kelly.
Yea, I agree, but Pete Carroll is more polished and seems like he can handle the business.
Well, didn't he try the NFL earlier in his career?
He might have, but this time, he is successful.
Yea, its pretty amazing that he was able to come to the NFL and have success right away.
Yea, I mean, it helps that he was surrounded by an amazing defense too.
Yea, that defense has been feared for years. Teams are scared of them.
Agreed! And with that crowd and that defense, nobody wants to play there.
I feel like their magic is starting to ware off a little bit, but some is still there.
I agree. I just feel like more teams are starting to rise up.
Yea, well theres only so many years you can stand above everybody else.
Yea, eventually they start pushing back.
I agree! Atlanta may be the class of the conference now.
Yea, they sure do have a great team!
I agree! We will find out just how good this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think it's actually awkward for Raiders fans to support the team, knowing that they're leaving town in a few years?
Yeah, I definitely do. They're going to Vegas, right?
Yeah. It must be odd wearing team apparel that you know will be outdated in a few years.
That's why fans shoudn't buy anything they can't afford to burn.
That's pretty funny. I do think it would be cool to see a team in Vegas though.
Yeah, I love that city. But I never thought it would have a team.
I think that the city has a good chance of really making good money off of the team considering how many people go through that city.
But don't you think that would be a problem, considering the city might not have enough home town fans?
No, I think that's what makes having a football team there marketable. It'll be an international favorite.
I could see that happening.
Yeah, especially since football is becoming more famous overseas. Tourists from other countries might become fans of the team.
That would be pretty cool to see the NFL have more international exposure.
It would probably mean more games overseas like they do now.
That's actually something I don't like. I hate watching games that are played in London for example.
They aren't too bad. Plus it'd be cool to see more international athletes take up football.
I just want to make sure that the games aren't affected because the players are jet lagged by the trip.
Well, at least the NFL makes sure the schedule accomodates those types of games.
I wonder if the NFL would think about bringing a team to Canada first.
I think I heard rumors that there might be for the future, but I'm not too sure.
It definitely would be a cool thing to see more expansion teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pittsburgh is my squad, dude...
Man call me when they actually do something.
What do you mean though? Six rings, man...
You guys always bring that up!
Yup, and we will always bring it up!
Like, when did they win it last? When I was a baby!
So? THey won though...
Whatever...stop living in the past.
Never. I will always represent.
But they can't beat the Patriots though
They will...and when they do everyone be quiet....
LOL. The Patriots always beat them. Ben is done as aQB.
Wait a minute, wait. a. minute. How are those Eagles doing?
Do't worry about them. They'll be alright.
LOL. No they won't. No they will not.
Didn't they beat the Steelers last year?
They got lucky. Besides, what did they do last year? Nothing
Nothing except beat your Steelers! LOL
It's ok...payback is a mother this year.
We'll see..
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the NFL?
Like, as a whole?
Sure, I was thinking the games and the teams.
Yeah, I mean I don't love NFL football but I don't hate it either.
I feel the same, really.
Like, I could never be a giant fanatic.
Yeah, like painting your body and going to every game.
Exactly, I do like a good tail gate party though.
Me too! Do you watch games with your friends?
Sometimes, if I get invited.
Oh, so it's either with them or not at all?
Yeah, unless it's a team I like playing.
Who do you like?
The Vikings, Steelers, Packers....
Oh, I love the Packers!
Really? They are my family team!
Mine too! My family has always loved them.
They are amazing, really underappreciated.
They actually have won more than half the other teams.
I know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL?
Yes, I love the Atlanta Falcons.
Me too. They have been my favorite team for years.
Mine too. I was a fan before it was cool.
Awesome. I am Matt Ryan's biggest fan.
Cool. I am Julio Jones fan.
He is awesome. So, how did you handle the big loss last season?
Oh, it hurt. It hurt bad.
I know. I almost smashed my TV.
Yeah, I wanted to throw mine out the window.
I am good now though.
Me too. We just got to get back this year.
I really hope we do.
Me too. I can't wait for the season to start.
I think I am going to host a few parties to watch. You interested?
Yes, that would be great.
Ok, cool. I will keep you posted on details.
Thanks so so much.
No, problem it will be fun.
It will. Go Falcons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you ready for some football?
Yeah, can't wait for the NFL season to start.
Who you rooting for this year?
The same team I root for every year.
Not the Giants.
Yes.
Wow, you are a diehard fan.
I'm what you call "loyal." Besides, they came close last year.
Yeah they did. Who did they lose their wild card to?
The Packers. But all in all they had a pretty good season.
Ok. I think they won 11 games and lost 5.
That is about right.
I heard they drafted Evan Engram in a first round pick.
Yes. They compare him to the good ole Jordan Reed.
They are both tight ends, right?
Correct, and you know Jordan Reed plays for the Red Skins?
Yes, he plays a good game.
Well, we will be able to see what both players bring to the field this year.
Good talent is always fun to watch.
Especially, when opposing defenses have trouble matching up against these players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the worst NFL team in the league right now?
The Cleavland Browns easily.
Really? Not the Jets?
The Jets are bad but The Browns are absolute trash right now.
You think the Jets would beat the Browns if they played right now?
Yes. It wouldn't be a stomp but the Browns would lose.
What factors makes you think the Browns are the worst?
In my opinion they need a serious roster change.
Who would you get rid of first?
Their quarterback would be the first to go. He is a detriment to the team's performance.
Ouch, thats pretty harsh.
I'm only going off of what I've seen and his statistics. The guy is just bad.
I have seen his stats so I can't argue there.
I don't think anyone really can. However he's not the only one at fault.
So you'd change out the whole roster?
I think I would if I was the owner. I would want a fresh start.
I think I'd cut half the team and not the entire roster.
Why?
Well I see potential in a lot of the players, I just think they aren't enabled to succeed.
I sort of agree with you, but I'm the kind of guy that wants to start fresh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Patriots ran 117 yards per game last season. Cowboys gave up 83.6 yards.
Oh wait I was wrong then. The ratio greater than 1 doesn't mean offense is good, it means it facing tougher opponent.
What?
I said earlier.. here look. Pat's 117 yards/game divided by Cowboy's 83.6 yards/game is equal to 1.39. This Doesn't mean the Pats will hve better time running, it means Pats will struggle against the Cowboy's run defense.
Wait, can we check this against last year's record?
I guess we could, let see who has a similar run record as the Pats in NFC?
Let's see. Pats ran 117 yards per game, so that would be... Either falcons with 120 or Panthers with 113 yrads per game
Let's look at how Cowboys' defense did against Falcons.  Wait... They didn't play Falcons last year. Let's check panthers
They didn't play the Panthers either... Let's try San Francisco, they ran 126 yards/game.
Ok. Dallas won that game 24-17. Now we have a game to check out metric against. So we have 49er's 126 yards/game gained average against cowboys 83.5 yards/games allowed
which is about 1.5. This should be analyzed how?
Well, we have to look at the data now. We need to run stat from that game
From the Cowboys/49ers game?
No, from the Cowboys and Pats game, Of course from the Cowboys/49ers game!
Dallas dominated the yards 428 for cowboys to 295 for 49ers
What was the run allwoed for the niners?
106 yards for the game, but they averaged 126 yard for the season.
Which means the runs were 84% of their season average with a decrease of 16%, so the metric of run offense vs run defense of 1.5 is correlated with 16% decrease in runs.
What does that tell you?
Maybe this thing woriks... we have to repeat this for all the teams. I need to write a program to do this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever wanted to play in the NFL?
No, but some people I know have.
Who?
There was a guy in my high school that did.
Who else?
A teacher at my high school did. Also a guy I work with did.
Are they not in there anymore?
No, they both got injured.
That's too bad.
Yeah, i had a couple friends who wanted to join but weren't good enough.
What happened with them?
They were big guys, but I'm not sure they practiced that much.
It would be an interesting job.
Yeah, it seems like you could get hurt easily.
It's funny how NFL players say that their job is just a game.
It is a cool job but not that important.
Entertainers make a lot of money.
And they can be famous.
it would take a toll on your body.
Yeah, you would have to push your body.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football please combe back on TV!
I know, it's been boring just watching baseball.
Before we know it football wil be on Thursday, Sunday and Monday night.
Thursday games are usually pretty boring but I watch them.
Yes it's usually teams like Cleveland or Jacksonville.
Maybe they are trying to get more exposure.
I'm not sure how those games are assigned, but it is a spot light for two teams.
Monday night football is my favorite.
I'd have to say Sunday night is mine. I like the NBC guys better.
John Gruden is my favorites so I lean towards Monday night football.
Well I hope both night have some good matchups.
They usually have some good divisional games likes Dalls versus Washington.
Do you like the Cowboys?
I do now.  Their team is fun to watch.
I like to watch the Saints throw a lot of passes.
Drew Brees can air it out!
Passing is the way of the NFL now.
For sure, but some teams have decent running backs.
You have to have a good running back to throw off defenses or they wil just drop back in coverage.
Thats why I'm liking the Cowboys lately.  Elliot is fun to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the coming NFL season this year?
Yeah I wish I could just freeze myself and wake up when it's the fall and football time.
What teams are you following the closest?
I'm a Raiders fan. I also like the Cowboys a lot.
The Raiders huh? Are you from Oakland or you just like the team?
No, I'm not from Oakland, I've never lived there. I've just always liked The Raiders since I was a kid.
Do you care that they're moving to Las Vegas in a few years
It's going to be weird not seeing them in Oakland but I'm more of a fan of the team than the city where they play.
So apparently Derek Carr signed a massive contract, do you think he'll live up to such lofty expectations?
I hope so, he's the future of the franchise. I would hate for all that money to be wasted.
Are you a part of Raider Nation, do you put on th makeup and costumes for games?
No, I just watch on television at home. I've only been to a couple of Raiders games in my life.
What other players do you like for Oakland?
I like Amari Cooper a lot. I've been following him ever since he was at Alabama and I expect good things in the future from him.
So if the Raiders are playing the Cowboys, who do you root for?
Definitely the Raiders. I like the Cowboys but not as much as I like Oakland.
You think they're going to make it to the Super Bowl this year?
I always think they were will before the season starts. Everyone's optimistic until the games start.
How many games do you realistically think Oakland will win this year?
I would say 10 to 11 games if my prediction for this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really hope the Vikings go to the Superbowl this year.
Meh.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means it won't happen.
How do you know?
Because they haven't been there since the 1970s and we lost at that.
But we made it to the playoffs since then.
That falls under the category of 'close but no cigar.'
Man, you're mean.
If by 'mean' you actually meant 'truthful' yes, I am.
We almost made it the year Brett Favre was in it.
Yeah, that was something.
The Saints really cheated.
I wouldn't call it cheating, but they were out of line.
I know.
Even if Farve was a mile away from the ball the Saints would have 10 guys pile up on him.
It was obvious they were trying to hurt him and put him out of commission.
Even I could see that and I almost never watch football games.
Well, we'll make it this year.
Sure. Then at the end of a losing season you'll be saying 'we'll get 'em next year.'
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, cool Jets shirt, you don't see many of those around here Eagles country.
My grandpa is a huge fan. He always gives me Jets merch for presents.
What do you think about Eric Decker going to the Titans?
I think the Jets will look like idiots for letting him go.
He was on fire before he got so banged up last year.
Yeah, Jets management will never cease to amaze me.
My cousins in NY curse Leon hess and blame him for everything.
They get a little momentum and then boom another stupid trade.
How do you feel about the Giants?
Personally, I like them more then some NFC teams but we don't mention them at grandpa's house.
I have an uncle in the city who says that the Bills are the only legitimate NY team.
A lot of people feel that way and refuse to root for Jersey teams.
Don't get me started on Eli Manning, I'm not a fan.
He's no Peyton, that's for sure.
The team has some serious talent but once again sketchy management.
The Big Apple and the NFL are two powerful forces. Who wants to be in the middle of that.
Remember when the Jets picked up Tim Tebow?
Tebow? That was ridiculous, they lost fans over that.
I would like to see decker put up some huge numbers this year.
He's got a one year contract, expect an myp performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about Colin Kaepernick?
The quarterback who was always kneeling during the National Anthem? I don't know much else about him
Yeah that's him, but what do you think of him as a player?
I know he played really well with the team for a while before they started benching him
And for Blaine Gabbert of all people
Who in their right mind would think Gabbert was a better option than Colin Kaepernick?
It's hard to understand what goes through the coaches' minds when they're losing so much in a season
That's true, and I suppose I'd want to make a change too if my quarterback was throwing four interceptions in a game
But what about all those players retiring from the 49ers? That probably made a huge impact on him as a player
I think you're right, which is why I think Kaepernick gets unfairly criticized as a player
Context is everything in the NFL, although overcoming adversity is a strong skill
Sure, but there's no way that Kaepernick being overlooked by so many teams has to do with his skill as a player alone
I don't like it when the NFL gets too political, it spoils the mood for me
It's such a popular sport that you can't blame players for being outspoken
I understand that, but I wish teams would just look at Kaepernick as a player and leave his political views out of it
Well if Michael Vick can get a second chance, I suppose anyone can
That's a bit different, though; Vick broke the law and did his time, and Kaepernick just silently protested something
Yeah it's a strange double standard when you think about it
Michael Vick was an elite quarterback, and Kaepernick never was
Sure, but maybe all Kaepernick needs is a second chance to make a huge comeback!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Minnesota Vikings will do this year?
I think they will be good, I'm hoping they can make the playoffs.
Me too, although I have learned not to get my hopes too high.
Same. Such is the life of a Vikings fan.
At least we're not the Browns.
True. I have a good feeling about our new rookie RB Dalvin Cook.
Me too, I can't believe he fell to us in the second round. Great value for one of the best backs in the draft.
Rookie of the year, calling it now.
That would make me so happy.
Do you think Teddy Bridgewater will play at all this year?
I don't think he will, but I think he will be healthy enough to play if needed. Sam Bradford will play well and be the starter for the entire season.
Yeah Sam was pretty good for us last year, even though we had a terrible offensive line.
That's why I think we will be improved this year. Adding o line players in free agency will really help our offense out.
It's all about who stays healthy though, we were saying the same thing last year.
Yeah good point. I guess we will just have to see what happens when the season starts.
Have you been to any games at US Bank stadium yet?
Not yet, but I toured it last year. It's incredible
Yep we have one of the best stadiums in the league for sure. Love it
I hope tickets won't be too expensive this year.
Well if they are, it means we are playing well. Good problem to have!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team has been to the most Super Bowls?
The New England Patriots
Really? How many Super Bowls have they played in?
Nine.
Nine?  I thought they won every time they played.  How many Super Bowl trophies do they have?
Five.
Only five?  How many Super Bowl trophies do the Pittsburgh Steelers have?
The Pittsburgh Steelers have Six Super Bowl trophies.
Six?  So they have more than the Patriots?
Yes, they do, even though they have not played in as many Super Bowls.
How many Super Bowls have the Steelers played in?
Eight.
So the Steelers have a better Super Bowl record than the Patriots?
That's right, probably because they're the better team.
Wait a minute. Are you saying the Steelers are better than the Patriots?
I am indeed. The facts don't lie. They have a better record in the Super Bowl, therefore they are the better team.
But don't they have to beat the Patriots to get to the Super Bowl?
That's true.
And how many times have they done that?
If you want to know the answer to that question, you'll have to look it up. I am sticking to my opinion that they are the better team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think JJ Watts?
What about him?
He is going to Texas.
To the Cowboys?
No, he is going back to the Texans.
What? Thought he was injured.
He is fine now.
He is one of the best they have had.
Yes, he was an all star in college.
He went to Wisconsin right?
Yes, big change to go to Texas.
Right, at least it is the Texans.
Why do you say that?
Texans have a smaller following.
Than who?
Than say, Green Bay, or the Cowboys.
How is that good?
Small town guy, going to a massive NFL team,lots of drama.
Well, at least he did not have to deal with Tony Romo.
I think he would be happy for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the Superbowl this year?
I think the Patriots have a good chance to win again.
Yes, as long as they have Tom Brady and Bill Belicheck, they have a chance.
Who else do you think will contend for a championship?
I really like the Dallas Cowboys as well.
Dak Prescott and Ezekial Elliott were amazing in their rookie years.
The Cowboys are in a tough division.
Yes, the NFC East will be very competitive this year with the New York Giants.
Are you a fan of the Giants or Odell Beckham Jr?
I am a big fan of the Giants and Odell.
How do you think the Giants will do this year?
They have a good chance of winning with the wide receiver group they have put together.
The Giants must be more consistent if they want to contend.
Eli Manning will have to have good form if they want to win.
Do you believe the Raiders will do well this year?
I think the Raiders have a great chance of winning.
How will Carr bounce back from injury?
Carr seems like a hard worker who will come back strong.
How will Marshawn Lynch fit into the Raiders team?
Lynch will be solid, but he is not the player he once was with the Seahawks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It seems like the Seahawks might be on the downswing, but they still have a good coach.
Yea, they have that and a great quarterback as well.
Yea, I agree, but I just keep wondering when Russell Wilson is going to ware down.
Yea, he is still young and hasn't yet.
Yea, I know. Some of these fast quarterbacks just ware down quickly.
Yea, we know RGIII did.
Yea, exactly, but it seems like Russell Wilson is less injury prone.
Yea, he seems to put himself in harms way less, but he needs to continue doing that.
Yea, if he can stay healthy and so can most of his team, they will still be a contender.
Yea, I agree, but there are a few teams still better in my eyes.
Yea, I'm not sure they can top the falcons.
Yea, especially if Matt Ryan has another repeat season.
Yea, he was amazing last year.
He was and he should be again. They have great receivers.
Yea, especially Julio Jones. That guy can fly.
Yea, it doesn't hurt to have one of the best running backs in the league.
Yea, they do and even their backup is even good.
Yea and they finally have a great defense.
Yea, they really were all around good last year.
Yea, its just too bad they couldn't win the big game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Patriots will do this season?
They'll probably do great like always.
Yeah, Tom Brady still seems to be in his prime.
It's crazy.
What do you think their record will be?
Probably 12-4.
Yeah, I'm guessing 11-5 or 12-4.
They lost their RB, but I think they'll be fine.
They seem to just plug players in.
They could make a paper bag look decent.
They have the best coaching staff in the league.
Bellichek is a football genius.
He knows how to win that's for sure.
It'd be interesting to see how he would do without Brady.
Yeah, I'd love to see what he would do.
I think he'd still do decent.
I definitely wouldn't bet against him.
I'd be scared to personally.
Yeah, hard to go against a proven track record like he has.
That's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?
You know, I used to sometimes, but mostly for the commercials and halftime show.
So you're not a huge fan.
But this year, I watched it for the game with a friend who is really into football.
What did you think of the game this year?
I mean, it was amazing right? Did you watch it?
I started to, but as the Patriots came back during crazy play after crazy play, I had to turn it off.
Ah, so you were a Falcons fan.
I've been a Falcon's fan all my life, yeah.
So you must've wanted to shoot yourself in the face during the second half of that NFL game.
You could say that. It was a disaster.
They say that Tom Brady has a reverse curse on him, and he'll keep winning until the apocalypse.
Right now I just want a lowly team like the Cleveland Browns to come in and beat them next season.
That would be an amazing game to watch.
The Patriots would finally pay for all the good karma they've been getting.
You don't think the Falcons made a lot of mistakes that Super Bowl? I think they deserved to lose.
My Falcons never deserve to lose. Matt Ryan is a god and deserves the best.
Do you have a little Matt Ryan action figure somewhere in your house that you kiss before you go to bed every night.
How did you know?
Because I have a Tom Brady one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't really mind football, Shirley, do you?
No, I don't dislike it, Jean. I enjoy the pageantry, the bands, and they sometimes have really good singers too.
Or really bad ones.
That's true, but you can enjoy the bad ones, too in a way.
I know, and I know I'm always affected by the national anthem, when it's sung in the stadium. It moves everybody, I think.
What I dislike, and this is just a minor complaint, is that we have to come so early.
Yes, they absolutely must tailgate.
And eat greasy food, and drink beer
But of course its better that people drink early. It gives them time to sober up.
Because the traffic is murder.
Yes, it's my least favorite thing about football.
My favorite thing is seeing your old friends from the section. Visiting with the neighbors, you know.
Yes, you get to see them again every year, all season.
You can catch up on what they did that summer. And see what's new.
Yes, that's always nice.
Then, if the 49ers win, everybody's in a good mood.
It kind of sets people up for a pleasant week.
Then, if they go to the playoffs, everybody's happy.
Or if the 49ers win the superbowl, the men say "we won."
As if they'd scored those touchdows themselves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the football season to start! How about you?
I'm probably not the person to ask; I don't follow sports at all.
Really? I can't imagine that!
The closest I ever get is when a team from an area I have a connection with is playing. I'm from Seattle, so  go, Seahawks.
Bet they're gonna miss Marshawn Lynch.
No kidding! But they have some other standout players, too.
Any other reasons you watch besides hometown team?
I do like some of the videos Seahawks  have online, throwing a football into a tire from the stands was impressive.
Yeah, that does show off some of the special skills the players have.
I think it helps attract fans who maybe aren't that fond of football, but do grow to like the players as people.
I never thought of it that way; I bet that's right.
Another way to draw in fans, and business, of course.
Yeah, they make a lot of money on all the shirts, hats, etcetera.
I read that Russell Wilson brought in between $15-20 million last year!
Wow, it's amazing, isn't it?
I guess people want a piece of the action, one shirt at a time.
I can't even imagine the salaries they make besides.
It does eem pretty high, but being paid well to risk injury, and most aren't in the game for a long time.
I'm more into the games themselves and the action and how well the game is played.
I've read that when you are really involved in sports and other activities, it's almost as if you were really playing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Talking about quarterbacks was so much fun, let's discuss running backs.  I say a name, you tell me what you think of them.
Awesome!
David Johnson
The best all around back in the league.  He'll get 1,000 yards rushing and receiving this year and 23 touchdowns.
Leveon Bell
Very talented back, but gets injured all the time.  I predict he gets hurt after eight games this year.
Ezekiel Elliott
The best young back in the league.  Running behind that offensive line, he'll easily get 1,500 yards this year
Lesean McCoy
Overrated back.  Runs and catches well but not very physical.
Melvin Gordon
Fourth best back in the league.  Good overall back who will have 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns this year
Adrian Peterson
One of the greatest backs to ever play in the NFL.  He's lost a step or two, I predict he only plays two more years.
Jay Ajayi
A talented back who is just figuring out the position.  Tough runner who is hard to bring down.
Todd Gurley
I think Gurley comes back this year and has a solid year.  The Rams upgraded their line which will reflect in his stats.
Marshawn Lynch
One of the greatest physical runners in his prime.  He took a year off, but he should have a solid year.  He's running behind the best line in the league.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Die hard fan!
Oh are you?
Yea, season ticket holder!
Rich?
Haha hardly!
Oh?
Yea, I got them as a gift
Which team?
Bills
Oh, super lucky!
You're a Bills fan too?
Yea since i was born!
Me too!
We should tailgate together sometime
It seems like a good plan!
Awesome!
Until next week!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not a diehard NFL fan. But, I used to like watching the Colts play with my dad.
Yea, I don't watch that much football, but I used to really like to watch Peyton Manning play.
Me too. He was my favorite player.
I hated when Indiana let him go.
I would still occasionally watch him when he played for Denver.
Me too. I hated when he played in the Super Bowl and lost with them.
Oh, I know. That game was horrible.
He was great. Too bad he retired.
He seems like a good guy. I've watched his brother, Eli play too.
I haven't seen him play that much.
Well, like I said, I don't really watch football all that much, especially NFL.
I like college football.
Me too. We go to some games now and then.
Do you still watch the Colts since Peyton is gone.
Sometimes. I rarely watch an entire game.
Luck seems to be a pretty good quarterback.
Yes, from what I've seen. But he's no Peyton Manning.
Not yet anyway.
We'll just have to wait and see how the season goes.
It will be here before we know it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the next nfl season look like?
Not sure ... what happened in the off season
Some of the free agents are not yet signed
Like who?
Colin Kaepernick, for one.  That would be a big loss.
Whoa!  That's right!
What about the Patriots?
They are looking good
Brady coming back?
Yes, that's a definite.
How old is he now?
Can you believe he will turn 40 next month?
No way!
Yep, on August third
Reminds me of George Blanda
Who?
Blanda.  Played until he was 48
Really?
Yea, but he was a kicker ... easier on the body
for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you really think romo will stay retired?
heck no.
you know he's going to be calling n f l games for fox.
that's just gonna make him miss the action even more.
do you think he's got anything left in the tank?
yep. i think dallas will be sorry they let him go.
naw, that young bull is the truth.
you talking about prescott?
yeah.
naw. i think this season he takes a major step backwards.
maybe. but i knew he wouldn't beat the packers in that playoff game last season.
why you say that?
he was a rookie. his first playoff game?
and?
and you know he was nervous. that's why they were getting trashed at the half.
yeah but second half they got it together.
true that.
they had a chance to win the game in over time.
but it shouldn't have gone to over time.
shoot, same thing like the falcons in the dang super bowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Dallas Cowboy fan?
Oh yes very much so, I used to live in Dallas.
Are you up set that Tony Romo retired?
Yes, I was hoping he could win a Super Bowl, but his back just couldn't hold up to the strain of the NFL.
Do you think Dak Prescott will improve this year?
Yes he should, he's very talented.
Will Ezekiel Elliot repeat last years performance?
He's a great running back and they need to just keep giving him the ball.
Who is Dallas's best wide receiver right now?
I would say it's Dez Bryant, as long as he can control his temper, he can play well.
Who is their best tight end?
They have Jason Witten, he's really good, but he's getting older, hopefully he has a great year.
Do they have some other good wide receivers?
Yes, Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley are pretty good.
Was their defense good last year?
Not really, if their defense was better they could have won the Super Bowl.
Who is their head coach?
It's Jason Garrett, he used to play for them.
Who is the owner of the team?
Jerry Jones owns the team and he's very involved in their football operations.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any news on the Broncos new quarterback
I heard about Trevor Siemens as the starting quarterback.
Is he any good?
I heard he was pretty good but his style is different then Payton Manning
Hopefully the team can get use to his style quickly.
I hope so they can have a good season.
I would love to see them in the playoff.
I liked the one year durning playoff when the Manning brothers had to go against each other.
That would have to be diffacult since the are both extremely competative.
I wonder if Payton might coach since he is retired from NFL now.
i just found it here that Coach Gary Kubiak announced to his team that Siemian will be the team's starting quarterback
So it is a definat that he will be filling Mannings shoes
Thats what i am reading so far.
Thats a lot of pressure for him.
It seems like he is pretty good so he should handel it pretty well.
So who is the 2nd in line
It says Sanchez was close with Sieman so i will assime he is next in line
Both seem to be pretty good and extremely hard workers
Well i hope it works out and they make it to the playoff.
Im sure they will be there maybe we will get lucky and they will win the championship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the big personalities in NFL football.
Like whom?
I'd say Ochocinco was one of them.
Gotta love Ocho.
He was a good player too.
Yes he was.
The players now seem drab.
Not all of them.
Is Tom Brady still playing?
Not sure.
Peyton Manning also has big personality.
Yes, him and his brother.
For me, it's about star quality.
Those are the ones that stand out!
They're no longer reality tv football stars.
True.
That was big about 10 years ago.
Those were the years.
Guess it's not bad that they're sticking to the craft.
Not at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am exciting about football season this year .
Who do you think will win it all?
I have no idea , but I am in fantasy football and it makes it more interesting
oh really I find that , that takes so much time.
It does but you learn a lot about the teams and the players .
Do you support any team?
Hard to beat Tom brady  .
I know but it is so hard to repeat
I am hoping for my home team the texans
Hopefully JJ will be healthy , but you need a good quarterback
I know we really do , we have so many of the pieces of the puzzle in place
I might try fantasy football this year
I was really lousy last year , but I learned a lot .
we had one guy who paid to get list made and he finished almost last.
A lot of it is luck , because all it takes is for someone to get hurt and then all the good ones are picked.
I love football , I have since I was a little kid .
me too I was raised in Texas also and football is like a real passion.
I know I remember high school football and we have some great college teams too.
Well I hope you do well this year
Thanks have fun if you do fantasy football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Going to see your Packers during the season?
Yes, my buddy and I have tickets to the December 3rd gsame in Tampa.
Tampa is an up and coming team. Can the Pack beat them?
The Pack can beat anybody on any given day. Just depends on getting a little defense.
What team do you dislike the most?
I would say the Bears as their fans are nasty.
What makes you say that?
I've been to games in Chicago when the Pack kicked butt and the fans threw stuff at us Packer fans.
How are the Bears treated when they go to Green Bay?
Packer fans are very knowledgeable. 99.9% are well behaved.
Who is your favorite current Packer?
I would say Aaron Rodgers.
Why is he your favorite?
Because he makes spectacular plays out of broken plays.
How do you think they will do this year.
If they can stay somewhat healthy, they should win their division.
Who is the biggest rival in their division?
Most people say the Bears but, I think it is the Vikings.
Can they get to the big game this year?
Sure, as long as Rodgers stays healthy and they get a bit of defense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long before the NFL season kicks off?
Not exactly sure but can't wait, how about you?
You are so right!
I think we should see some preseason play in August don't you think?
Yep.
I just got my season tickets.
I wish I could afford season tickets.
Maybe you can come to a couple of games this season.
The ticket prices have gone through the roof.
I know and don't even bring up the $10 for a beer!
Does your better half watch any games?
No.  Unfortunately
My girl friend is a big fan.
That must be so cool.
I'm looking forward to seeing what Tom Brady can do this year.
Yeah.  He sure came through in the Superbowl.
The Falcons were an epic collapse in the last season SuperBowl weren't they?
You got that right. Embarrassing.
Who do you think will take it all this year?
It would be tough to go against the Patriots.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the NFL season start?
Around September or October I think.
Nice. Who's playing in the opening game?
I'm not sure but they always make the defending champs play he opening game.
Man I hate the Patriots. I hope they don't win again this year.
Me too but their team got even better than last season.
Who did they get this offseason?
They got Brandin Cooks, a true #1 receiver and Gilmore, another lockdown corner.
Damn. They will be a though out but I have a feeling it's the Raider's year this year.
Didn't they get Marshall Lynch to come out of retirement?
Yes he filled one of their biggest needs and I think it will take them over the hump.
No way he's too old and he hasn't played in years.
That means he's more fresh and healthy. Plus they have one of the best offensive lines in football.
Well what about the Falcons? Do you think they can make it back to another super bowl?
No, I think the loss in last year's super bowl will be too though to get over mentally.
I agree. They choked big time.
And I hate them for it. I can't believe they handed the patriots another super bowl ring.
Why do you hate the Patriots so much?
I'm a Jets fans, we  are born to hate them.
Oh ok it all makes sense now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm ready for football season. What about you?
Yes, I'm ready to see what the Falcons are going to do this year. Who do you think will win it all?
Definitely the Cowboys.
The Cowboys haven't won since the 90's and they lost their whole secondary last year.
The Falcons got demoralized last year. They blew a 25 point lead.
All Cowboys fans are the same. They think they will win it every year.
That what all fans suppose to think.
Well if that is the case, Go Falcons.
You can't come back from what happened last year.
We are closer to the big dance than the Cowboys.
We will see. When we make it, we won't blow a lead like that.
They won't make it.
Ok, I hear you.
Dez Bryant sucks and always having emotional breakdowns.
After last year Superbowl, I'm sure the whole Falcons team had an emotional breakdown.
The Falcons is solid on both sides of the ball. Dallas still needs pass rushers and corners.
Every year our defense is so weak but Rod Marinelli scheme is so good that he covers up those holes.
I see all the holes every year.
Also we control the pace of the game and Dak proved in the playoffs that he is capable of leading a comeback.
He also shows that he is incapable of getting to the big game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, what you think about the Bears this year?
Oh gosh, talk about a re building year.
Well I don't think they'll be that bad.
I don't know man, trading for Trubisky might be one of those trades that haunts a team for a long time.
Yeah I don't know, he might be really good.
Yeah but they already signed Mike Glennon in the off-season.
Wasn't he just hired to take the lead dog role while Trubisky got ready?
Possibly, but they sure signed him to fat deal to just be a book mark.
What did they give away to get Trubisky anyway?
Bro, all they moved up was one spot, and they gave away I think three or four more draft picks.
Ooh, yeah I didn't know that.
Yeah, so now you've got a developing quarterback, with no help on the roster.
Yeah and that's a big deal.
Right, quarterbacks don't get better when they scrambling for their life because no one is open.
Right, or the line sucks because you've ignored it all in the draft.
Right, which is the mistake I think the Bears made.
Boy the Niners sure did well in the draft huh?
Yeah for being a brand new gm, John Lynch did alright.
At least with that deal anyway.
Well yeah, you never really know how good a draft is until years later anyway.
XXXXXXXXXXX
O.K., I've got one for you.  What was the greatest football team of all time?
Wow, that's tough.  I guess you start with the Miami Dolphins, only team to go undefeated.
Yeah, but that's going back to the seventies.  I think players are bigger, stronger, and faster now.
So you would eliminate the great Packer and Steeler teams of long ago even thought they were dominate in their eras?
I don't care about eras--if you lined the teams up against each other across the eras, who would win?
So the Steelers are out.
Probably, although Bradshaw, Swan, Harris--that's pretty impressive.
So the great 49er teams are out, too?
Well, not so fast--they played in the 80's and played modern football and Montana, Rice, and Lott with that defense--pretty tough.
Well, if you're going to consider the 80's, how about the '85 Bears.
I'll give them the greatest defense ever, but not enough offense to be the greatest team ever.
The team that probably should have been the greatest was the New England team that went undefeated until the Super Bowl.
Yeah, you could be right, but you can't be the greatest if you lose the Super Bowl.
And when you think of New England, you only think of Brady and Belechek.
I think you're right, although obviously they've had many great players.
You know I'm getting a headache--there's been Dallas and Seattle and the Giants and so many good teams.
Don't take it seriously--it's just for fun.
I know--well, what team would you pick?
Well, I'm biased towards the 49ers in the Montana years--I mean Steve Young is your backup, Bill Walsh your coach...
Yeah, pretty good choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever collect football cards?
Yeah, when I was younger.
Do people still do that today?
Sure.
I used to have all the teams cards organized so well.
Me too.  I wish I had some today.
Yeah, my mom got rid of mine.
They would be worth a pretty penny some of them.
I know.
What card do you think was worth the most?
I think Joe Namath would be worth a lot.
I loved him.
Who's your favorite player today?
I love Roethlisberger.
He's been around a while.
Yep, and still doing well.
He's amazing.
I know.  He's up there in age for a football player but does his share.
Sure does.
I can't wait for the season to start!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The past few superbowls have been kind of uninteresting
I agree. I don't care about any of the teams
I loved when the Saints won in 2009
Oh my god. That was such a good game too
They were underdogs for sure
Coach Payton really gave the city a gift with that win.
It was also fun to watch the Baltimore superbowl that happened in the superdome
The one where Beyonce performed at the halftime show?
Yes, and then the lights went out for a few minutes?
That was so New Orleans.
I hope an underdog team makes it to the superbowl this year
Like who?
The Panthers haven't been in awhile
True. what about the cleveland browns
they might not win a single game this year
I feel the same way about the Rams
Remember when the Lions had all those losing seasons
Yep, they're pretty alright now though
You never know what a team will do
We'll see this season who shakes it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!
Yea I go to every game I can
I watch from home
Oh?
Yea I get super drunk
I drink some at the games
But yea I get really hammered!
How hammered?
I got so mad last time
Mad?
Yea my team fumbled the ball and i smashed my TV
I bet that went over well
My wife came in and told me that I was crazy
How did that turn out?
I ran out of the house
Where did you go?
Hotel room
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think will be the NFL's top rookie this year?
Wow, that's tough to say. After all, who thought Dak prescott would do anything at this time last year?
True, but I have to think Leonard Fournette will do great things in Jacksonville.
That's probably right. They'll lean heavily on him with Blake Bortles being so mediocre.
They will. And Christian McCaffrey should put up some good numbers in Carolina.
Yeah, as a runner and receiver, he should get a lot of touches from Cam Newton this year.
Yep. And while QBs are hard to predict, I have to think Deshaun Watson will put up some good numbers in Houston.
Yeah, they were a mediocre division winner last year, but they were a winner, and joning a winner is always easier for a rookie.
He has to beat out Tom Savage, but that shouldn't be hard.
Nope, and he brings a level of mobility there they've never had at quarterback.
Dalvin Cook should get a lot of touches in Minnesota.
The Vikings thought enough of him to unload Adrian Peterson, so that's probably right.
And what about run-stoppers? Myles Garrett was the top overall pick, and he should help Cleveland's defense improve immediately.
Yeah, but the rest of that defense is so bad it may overshadow him.
Haason Reddick joins a decent Arizona defense and should make their linebacking corps a lot better.
Same could be said for Malik Hooker, anthough he comes into a Colts secondary that got beat up last year.
Jamal Adams may be a better safety, but he comes into an even worse situation with the Jets.
Yeah, they may get torched so much this year his play will be rendered moot.
I wouldn't rule out Derek Barnett, either.
Yeah, the Eagles weren't horrible last year, and with him at defensive end they can only get better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
IS THE BRONCOS NEW HEAD COACH GOING TO THEM THEM BACK TO THE PLAYOFFS?
HE IS A DEFENSIVE COACH AND THE BRONCOS HAVE A GOOD DEFENSE.
I AGREE BUT IS HE A BETTER DEFENSIVE COACH THAN WADE PHILLIPS?
REMEMBER THEY STILL HAVE A LOT OF TALENT ON DEFENSE.
I KNOW BUT THE OFFENSE IS STILL SHAKY.
I AGREE, I AM NOT CONVINCED THEY HAVE A QUARTERBACK TO LEAD THEM TO THE PLAYOFFS.
TREVOR SIMIAN WILL PROBABLY BE THE STARTER.
PAYTON LYNCH STILL NEEDS TO PROVE HE CAN PLAY IN THE NFL.
THEY HAVE THE WIDE RECIVERS TO STRETCH THE FIELD SO THAT SHOULD HELP.
SANDERS PLAYED WELL BUT THE FRANCHISE PLAYER WAS DISAPPOINTING.
I KNOW BUT THEY WILL HAVE BETTER RUNNING BACKS TO HELP WITH THE RUNNING GAME.
JAMAL CHARLES WAS A GOOD PICK UP IF HE STAYS HEALTHY.
AT LEAST HE WON'T BE HELPING THE CHIEFS.
ALSO ANDERSON IS COMING BACK FROM AN INJURY.
ALL IN ALL I LOOK FOR A 8 WIN SEASON.
THE OTHER TEAMS IN THEIR DIVISION ARE GOOD AND IMPROVING.
THE BRONCOS WILL ALSO MISS KUBIAK.
HE QUIT AND I AM GLAD.
HIS HEALTH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A FOOTBALL GAME.
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE SEASON TO GET STARTED!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best run NFL franchise, would you say?
Gotta go with New England.
Can't really argue with their success in the Belichek/Brady Era.
Nope, they're the gold standard.
I have two reservations there.
Oh, what are they?
Number one is the cheating stuff.
Ahh, a lot of that is overblown.
Deflate -Gate was definitely ridiculous, but Spy-Gate was real.
It was pretty bad. But I still say that doesn't disqualify them.
My other issue is that it seems like all their success is due to coach and star quarterback.
So what? They still won the games!
Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean the whole organization is strong.
OK, then what team would you pick?
I'd go with the Steelers.
Yeah, they're hanging with New England in terms of rings.
Rings, but also sustained success.
Yeah, they've won with multiple coaches and quarterbacks.
Exactly. I think their ownership structure really knows how to run a winner.
Can't really go wrong with either team!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited about NFL football returning!
I am too, Pre-season is just around the corner.
Who is your favorite team in the NFL.
One of my favorite teams in the NFL is the Denver Bronchos.
They won the super bowl recently didn't they.
Yes, in 2015 the Bronchos won the Super Bowl.
That was a special season wasn't it.
Yes it was, not only was it the first great season since the Elway era, but a legend played his final year.
Manning was the quarterback for the Bronchos then right?
Yes, and Manning mimmiced the great Elway.
How are Manning and Elway similar?
Manning won the super bowl for the Bronchos on his final year of playing in the NFL before he retired.
Did Elway win a superbowl?
Yes, and John Elway won the super bowl in 1998  on his last year of playing as well.
Wow, so Elway and Manning are legends!
Yes, and they both played and won super bowls during their last season with the Bronchos.
Who is the quarterback now for the bronchos?
Who knows who the quarterback will be for the Bronchos this season.
That is interesting, Manning will be difficult to replace.
Yes he will, just look at the Colts and what they have done since he left.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Go write one.
No. it's too much work. Soemone probably already did all this.
How do you know?
Otherwise, why would the NFL make all this data available?
Maybe they just like data.
No. It's a part of a tradition. thy've always kept meticulous track of their data. It's matter of someone putting things together
I'm willing to bet money Fantasy sports sites have all this worked out.
Probably. Otherwise, they have no other way to rank the price the players.
Take the run data for the rushers, and match up against the run defense?
Yep. That's how they determine the prices. Anway enough of metrics for the teams and players. How did we get into this anyway?
Passer ratings.
Oh yeah.. so yeah. passer rating is useful, but only for the passer.
The passer only passes.Football is more than just passing
Ugh, again. I'm not arguing.
You know what ESPN should do?
What?
Release their formula for QBR.
Well people wanted that for a while now.
I don't think they will do it
They're probably going to use it for their Fantasy games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the eagles are going to do this year?
Same as every year.
What's that?
Fail miserably!
Ha,  No I dont think so. I think they will be pretty good.
Yea maybe. They got 2 new receivers that are proven.
True, I cant wait to see them with our QB.
Yea theyre gonna light up the scoreboard.
Our defense is where most of our talent is.
Fletcher Cox is a beast!
So is the rest of the D-line.
Gonna shut Dallas down hard.
Well lets not go to extremes.
Dallas is good I know that.
Yea they are and I dont think you can shut them down..
Right , you can only hope to contain them.
Exactly. Hopefully we are good this year and next draft is the key. we need to build up the o-line more.
And we need to get a stud runningback!
I hate playing catch up to Dallas.
Seems like thats all we ever do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Dolphins training camp start July 27th?
That's right around the corner!
The public can go to 13 practices.
I didn't know we could go.
They let people come to some of them. They let around 200 people in each one.
Have you ever been?
I went one year, I took my nephew when he was 10.
Did he enjoy it?
Yes, they make it a big deal.
Like what?
They have face painting food trucks.
Sounds like a fair.
Not really, but the kids can get autographs from some players.
Did your nephew get an autograph.
Yes, on a football.
Does he still have it.
I don't think so.
Why not.
I'm pretty sure he sold it.
That's hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of the Packers this year?
I'm really excited. The new tight ends are going to make the offense unstoppable.
I completely agree. Martellus Bennett is an animal.
Yeah! And don't forget about Lance Kendricks either!
Yeah, I really liked him when he played for the Wisconsin Badgers.
Yup! And he's been sneaky good in St. Louis and Los Angeles the last few years.
Yeah, and that was with terrible quarterbacks!
Yup. Imagine what he is going to do with Aaron Rogers instead of Jared Goff! Ha!
Yup. Once you come to think about it, he's not all that different than Jared Cook was last year. Comes from a bad QB situation and is athletic as heck!
Man you are getting me excited. Teams are not going to be able to defend the Packers.
Yup. Like I think Bennett is superior to JerMichael Finley and remember what the offense was like with him? This is going to be awesome.
Yeah, the Packers were even unstoppable last year with Jared Cook, who was not even as good as Finley.
Rodgers is so good when he has a TE to stretch the field in the middle. It just opens up Jordy even more as well.
Man, if we have a running game, we could set offensive records.
Totally. And between Montgomery and the three rookies, I think we'll be completely fine.
I cant believe Lacy left to go to Seattle.
I can. He probably was angry at Mike McCarthy for always caring about his weight.
Well didn't you see the rumors he was approaching 270 from Bob McGinn of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel? The Seahawks even put a weight provision in his contract.
Wow. Has he had to weigh in for the Seahawks yet?
Yup. He's passed them so far, but that was the same last year when he was with the Pack.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best team in football?
The Patriots
I agree
That comeback was historic
I did not think they would come back
It was the best comeback of all time
I wonder why the Falcons just did not run it on their 3rd down.
That was a costly mistake
Hopefully they do good next year
Yeah. They still have a good team
I hope the Texans have another good year too
Yeah, they deserve it
What did you think of the draft?
I was happy with it.
I hope the Browns draft pick does good
They need someone to step up.
Yes they do
Where are the Browns from?
Cleveland
Oh yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know why you root for the Pats
They're the home team, you gotta support the locals
Yeah but Belichick's a hack, Brady too
So?
So why root for dirty cheaters?
The franchise is bigger than a couple of guys, not all of the Patriots are cheaters
I still don't get it.
Well I've been a Pats fan my whole life, I'm not going to jump ship just because we have a few bad eggs on board right now.
Whatever, go Steelers!
Steelers?  Seriously?
What?
They're not even going to make the playoffs
You're the one who just lectured me about sticking with your team...
Yeah but you're not even from Pennsylvania
But my Dad is, and I grew in a Steelers house.
Fair enough.
But they could make the playoffs this year.
They wont
It could happen
A flying pig could happen too, but it wont.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm pumped for next season! How about you?
You know it. Your Cowboys are going down to my Birds!
No way! Dez Bryant and Dak Prescott will lead us to another NFC East title!
Ha, you wish! Carson Wentz has some new weapons and an improved D. We're headed to the top!
Carson Wentz is a joke! Scouts have him figured out!
Not a chance. He didn't have any help last year.
Doesn't matter. Dak Prescott is the real deal.
You're living in a dream world. Carson is the better QB.
Who made the playoffs last year? Dak.
Yeah, but he had Ezekiel Elliott. Carson had nobody.
I don't know, Darren Sproles is pretty good.
Not on the same level as Ezekiel.
Put Dak with any team, he has a better record than Wentz.
You're living in a dream world. Carson has better mechanics.
Dak threw for more yards and had a better QB rating.
Do you know how many receivers dropped Wentz's passes? Too many.
Dak also does it with his feet, man. He's the total package.
We'll see next season. Eagles are going 11-5 and winning the East.
Ha! More like 5-11!
Your Cowboys don't stand a chance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
The Giants.
Why do you like the Giants"
I grew up in the New York area and hate the Jets.
Did you attend many games as a kid?
I usually went once a year with my dad and brothers.
I went to the old Giants Stadium a few times.
Really?  Did you do any tailgating outside?
Sure, I remember the frigid cold days with a nice fat sausage and peppers with some hot sauce with a nice beer to wash it down.
The good old days.  Now, it's insanely expensive.
Did you get a chance to see any of the playoff teams back then?
Yeah, I got to see some of the Parcells wins back in the 90's when the Tuna was in charge.
So I take it you hate New England, huh?
Not really, we bested them in two Super Bowls in the last 10 years, we ain't afraid of them.  Brady is pretty awesome though.
You're telling me man.  What he pulled off last year against Atlanta was pretty sick.
Hope the Falcons can bounce back this year, I like Matt Ryan.
You plan on getting out to any games this season?
Maybe if I can get seats at a reasonable price.  Otherwise, I'll invest in a new TV.
Who's going to win it this year?
G-men all the way baby.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team do you think will have the worst record in NFL this season?
I think the Cleveland Browns could have the worst record.
What team do you think will have the best record?
I think the New England Patriots will do well and make it to the Super Bowl.
Do you think that Tom Brady will lead the New England Patriots?
Yes, I think he will have a great season.
What other quarterback do you think could potentially make it to the Super Bowl.
My favorite would be Russell Wilson.
I think he will have the drive and the motivation to help the Seattle Seahawks to make it to the Super Bowl.
I agree that he will be motivated. Yet, I think the Pittsburgh Steelers could be more motivated to win.
Although they lost, they worked really hard last year.
I think that Ben Roethlisberger will lead the team to its victory.
I think that losing can help a team come back and win. Yet, I still have hope for the team with the worst record.
Do you mean the Cleveland Browns?
I think DeShone Kizer will be a quarterback that will overcome challenges each time they are on the field.
I think the team needs to work offensively and defensively to score touchdowns.
I'm looking forward to seeing them work offensively to score touchdowns this season.
Do you think that the 49ers have a chance without Colin Kaepernick?
I think a team can still work to win without its star quarterback.
I'm not sure they can. I'm excited for the season to begin because there is so much anticipation regarding what lies ahead with each team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Superbowl XXXVIII on replay.
The second Patriots' Superbowl victory?
Yes, a good one.
I did not think the Panthers would be that good.
They were only 11-5.
I think the Pats were 14-2.
I was surprised the score was 0-0 after the first quarter.
What was the score at the half?
14-10, Patriots.
The halftime show was a riot.
Oh, yes.  Janet Jackson's "wardrobe failure".
I think it was staged.
No scoring in the third quarter.
The fourth was a riot of scoring.
How many points were scored?
37.
Wow, exciting.
The Panthers tied it with 1:02
A replay of the last Patriots' SB win!
Yes, another Vinateri field goal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why didn't Peyton Manning win more Super Bowls?
He won two.  That's pretty good.
Yeah, but he is suppose to be a football robot.
You got to remember the Colts were terrible for his first 4 or so years.
The Colts were pretty good for the next 10 or so years.
True, but the Colts never had a great defense.
That's not true.  They had a dominate defense a few years.
The Colts defense was fast but they were all small guys.
Would you rather big slow guys?
You need some size on defense or you can't stop the run.
I guess that is true.  The Colts run defense was never great.
The whole defense was never great.  The Colts offense was just so dominate that it didn't matter.
So, back to the question.  Why didn't Peyton win more Super Bowls?
Well the easy answer is because of the New England Patriots.
Man, those were some good games Colts vs Patriots.
Yeah, but the Patriots won the majority of them.
The Colts never really could figure out the Patriots in the playoffs.
Well we'll look back and realize that the Patriots are having one of the best runs in NFL history.
I think Peyton should have won 4 Super Bowls with those teams.
Hey, he won 2 and got to 3 Super Bowls.  That's pretty good in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear any more about the Raiders moving to Vegas?
I thought it was a done deal?
Already? For this coming season?
I don't know for sure but it will be interesting. They played good last season, though.
They really did! Kind of surprising...
So did Vikings and Titans, too.
Yeah, right? Nice to see these teams coming up though.
They'd better beat the Pats is all I can say...
You, me both! I hope the Browns beat the Pats!
Hahha! that will be the best! In your face, Patriots!
What do you think of the Dolphins?
They haven't done much lately. I remember their glory days though...
I used to be a Dolphin fan back in the days.
You mean like Dan Marino days?
Yeah, nobody could compare to him.
What about Joe Montana or Elway?
Montana, yes especially with Jerry Rice, Elway, no!
You don't like Elway?
He's okay, I'm just saying he's not in the same league as Montana.
Yeah, you may be right there...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching football laterly?
A lttle bit, I usually only wait till the Super bowl to have  a football day watching. What about you?
I watch the game regularly.
Do you have a favorite team?
Yes, the one I usually bet on to win, I do some betting with the teams. What about you?
No, I don't bet on the games.  Who is your favorite player?
The manning brothers, what about you?
Brady.  So what do you like about football?
the game, the scoring, the excitement.  What about you?
the game, I like watching how players put a lot on the line, plus some of the long distance pass and catches highlight are impressive.
I like the passing and running game.
Me too, but there is more uncertainty on the passing where the ball is in the air which is exciting.
What do you dislike about the game?
the injury, collision. What about you?
the long breaks in between.
what else?
the cheer leaders
Ohh, I like the cheer leaders too.
Do you think the players are overpaid?
yes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The sports bar in town is playing the big game tonight. Do you want to go?
Sure. I am always up for some NFL football.
Cool. A bunch of the guys are coming.
Sounds good man.
What time are you meeting.
I plan to be there around 7.
That works for me. I will be there.
Good. You ready to see the Saints get spanked.
Whatever brother. We got this one.
I doubt that. But this is going to be fun to watch together.
It will be fun. I promise I won't get to out of control.
No worry man.
I know I am passionate about my team
I am too.
My girl may join us. Is that good with you?
I don't care.
She has friend.
Tell her to bring her.
I will.
See you at 7.
XXXXXXXXXXX
As of recent, all of the New York football teams sure have been bad
I agree, that's pretty clear
The Giants were the last good team and that was years ago they won the superbowl
Yeah and the jets are a joke
The Giants usually have good talent on the team each year I wonder what their problem is
They are poorly coached in my opinion
Yeah I think they recently fired someone from their coaching staff
I believe they fired their head coach
That was probably a good choice, it wasn't working out after they had won the super bowl
The jets are also pretty bad
Yeah but they've been bad for a while
They have a lot of problems
The jets are far away from being any good
Yeah they are lacking critical parts to their team
They need a complete overhaul so they can come back
The entire team and staff needs to be gutted
I'm sure new york fans are ashamed
I would be
I would be clinging to the Giants superbowl win a few years ago
I'm sure most of those fans are!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What NFL division do you think is the toughest out of them all?
You have to go with the AFC West as the strongest.
Why do you say that?
There's four teams in the division that could make the playoffs this year.
You really think the Los Angeles Chargers are going to make the playoffs?
I thnk they'll be greatly improved from last year.
They might be better but making the playoffs is a very bold prediction.
So which division do you think will be the strongest this coming year?
I'm going to go with the AFC South as the toughest division in the NFL.
That's a good choice, I think the AFC South is the very strong as well.
Jacksonville kind of lowers the rating of the division but the rest of the teams are all going to be fighting for the division championship.
Who are think is going to win the AFC South in 2017?
My opinion is that the Indianapolis Colts will take it in 2017.
How do you think Andrew Luck is going to do this year for the Colts?
He should have his usual numbers but I like Indianapolis' offensive line protecting Andrew Luck.
Yeah not enough is said for a strong offensive line. The quarterback gets all the glory but the offensive line makes it all possible.
The thing I don't like about the Colts is their defense. Their defense was terrible last year.
The way I see it, they can't possibly be worse so if they're just slightly better, then the Colts have a good shot to win the division.
If the Colts don't win, who is your second choice to win the AFC South?
I'd probably go with Houston repeating as division champs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite team in the NFL?
I have loved the Green Bay Packers since I was a kid, what about you?
That's awesome! I'm a huge Detroit Lions fan, so it looks like we are rivals!
Being a Lions fan is rough, so I commend you on your loyalty.
Yeah, it's a been a tough go of it, but I think we are getting better.
I think so too, although your head coach needs to be fired.
Most fans agree with you and I think Caldwell will be fired if we don't win a playoff game next year.
It's been forever since you've won one, so it might be a longshot.
We haven't won since we have been in the NFC North, so that tells you how long it's been.
I think you guys are tough opponents and I always looking forward to our games twice a year.
It would be nice to see you at least three times, right? How great would a Lions/Packers playoff be?
Oh it would be awesome, especially since I think we are the top two teams of the division.
Not much competition there, have you seen the Bears lately?
Well, the Vikings didn't do much better this season, but really both our teams are one injury away from looking like that.
I know! I couldn't believe that Teddy Bridgewater injury at training camp, he is so young and talented!
I hope for the sake of their franchise and our division he returns healthy, because I'm tired of Sam Bradford.
I can't believe that Vikings fans think he is so talented! He is so overrated!
Yeah he is! He is nothing more than a systems quarterback with no pocket presence.
Beyond that, he never seems like much of a leader in the huddle.
I wonder if that was because he was new, or if he has a hard time gaining the offense's respect?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite team?
I would say The Eagles.
I love the Cowboys
Then we cant be friends
Hey Dak is better than Carson!
Not true, its hard to judge after one year.
Dak had better numbers
He also had a RB who can deal, Wentz did not have nearly the weapons
What about on defense?
Tough to say
I think Fletcher Cox is a beast
I dont think so to be honest
Having buyers remorse?
I think they overpaid him
Someone would have paid him
Yeah the NFL overpays all their lineman
Except for the ones protecting the quarterback
I think corner and quarter backs should be paid the most
Well the eagles dont have a cornerback
hey either do the cowgirls!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was listening to the radio today.  They had a list of the best coaches for the Saints.
The football team?
Yeah, they had a list of the top five.
I'm sure Sean Peyton was at the top of the list.
I was guessing the same.
You mean you didn't listen?
I got out the car before they mentioned a single name.
Wow.  I would have stayed in the car to hear that!
Well, they said it would be online.  And they kind of alluded that Payton would be topping the list.
I wonder who the other coaches were.
The first name that came to my mind was Mike Ditka.
Yeah, I was thinking him and Jim Mora.
I don't know if that might have been because they coached when we were growing up though.
It could be, but they both did pretty decently.
Yeah, but only Payton went all the way.
Yeah, you're right.
Who else did Ditka coach?
I'm pretty sure it was Chicago you are thinking of.
Yeah, that's it.  It was the bears.
I think most of the other coaches coached other teams too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the upcoming Packers games?
Yes, I'm a huge fan.
I think they had some great draft picks off-season.
I was not impressed by the draft choices.
Why do you say that about the draft choices?
Because the packers need a running back, and they did not spend a high pick on one.
I suppose that is true.
It is definitely true, and now they are stuck with depending solely on Rogers.
That's not all bad because Rogers is great.
Yes, he is the best quarterback in the league.
I agree, and he is still as strong as ever.
But his receivers are a joke this year.
That is true, and the packers don't seem concerned about it.
They have all 30 or older receivers, and that will hurt them.
What about the two young receivers they drafted?
It will take a couple years before the new receivers can contribute.
Yes, the NFL is a tough place to come up quickly.
There is a good chance that all their offensive picks this year will be wash outs.
But I am still hopeful that the packers could win it all.
I guess I am hopeful as well for the packers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it too early to write off the Panthers?
What? Dude, you're crazy.
I don't know. You think Cam's still got it?
Dang, man. He's what, 28? Of course he's still got it.
Alright. Just seems like he's too sensitive, you know? Like he's got just a tiny bit of Vince Young in him.
That's crazy, man. Just silly. I mean, how about we start with a decent O-line for him?
Ok, ok. I'm willing to go with that. So he's got some big boys blocking up front. He's still going to run.
Uh. Yeah. And that's what's so great. I mean, he's no joke.
But what about injuries?
Injuries happen. Cam needs an O-line. Then get back to me with your complaints.
What about the division overall?
What, the NFC South? Yeah, well, you know, you've got a lot of talent. Maybe too much talent.
The A going to get back to the Superbowl?
It's hard. That's just hard to do.
True. What do you think though?
Atlanta has the best shot to win the division. Tampa will be right in the thick of it. I mean, look, you've got Cam, Ryan, Brees, and Winston? That's absurd.
Too much of a good thing?
Good competition. Just only one can get out. Saints aren't going to do it. Really, though, any one of the other three very well could.
Who do you want?
Want? The Falcons. For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do,you think the chiefs make the playoffs?
I don't know.
They have a tough schedule.
I'm reading 8-8 predictions.
I saw that.
Andy Reid will keep them in it.
He's a good coach.
He's done well.
He had some good years with the eagles too.
Yes he did.
They have the fourth toughest schedule.
I saw that.
Could be a tough division too.
I think,the defense keeps them in most games l
I agree with that.
I don't know if they'll score a lot.
They have to get off to a better start than last year.
That's true.
A better offense than last year hopefully.
We will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Cleveland lose their NFL team?
Yes and no.
What do you mean?
In 1995, the owner moved the team to Baltimore. But, through a complex set of agreements, the franchise remained in Cleveland.
So, one team became two teams?
Yes, but it didn't happen all at once.
What happened?
The Browns franchise became dormant for several years.
When did it return?
The Browns again took the field in 1999.
How have things gone since their return?
It can be argued that they are the worst NFL team in the new millenium.
Wow, that's pretty bad!
Yes, there are several pieces of evidence for such a bold claim.
What is this evidence?
They have no playoff wins during that time.
Have they even made it to the playoffs?
Yes, in 2002, they made it. But, they immediately lost.
How about winning seasons?
They have had only two winning seasons in the new millenium.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Heck yeah, it's my favorite sport!
How long have you liked it?
I've liked it since I was a kid. My dad and I watched it together for as long as I can remember!
What was your dad's favorite team?
He really liked the San Francisco 49ers
Do you like the 49ers then?
I used to but now I live in a different state
What team do you like most nowadays?
I like the Arizona Cardinals because I moved to Arizona
Oh that is amazing. I am actually a 49er fan myself.
We can still talk about them!
Okay, so what year did you watch the 49ers mainly?
I knew a lot about them back in the 90s
So when Steve Young was playing for them?
Yeah, he was the best quarterback ever
Even better than Joe Montana?
Yeah, I like him a lot too but Steve Young was very personable, in my opinion
What year did Steve Young retire?
He retired back in 1999
XXXXXXXXXXX
What NFL team do you hate?
Ummm, the Seahawks probably.
Yep, I hate them too, also Dallas Cowboys.
Yes! America's Team? They need to upgrade that.
Yeah, haha.
I doubt they will win a Super Bowl this year.
I doubt it too but you never know.
The Minnesota Vikings need to win one.
Yeah, they do. The oldest team to not win one I think.
Yeah, oldest in all sports I think.
Poor Vikings.
Yeah, maybe they will get one someday.
Adrian Peterson is gone but I think they are better off for it.
Me too, they have a lot more cap space for sure.
Yeah, and he was getting old and not as productive.
Agreed.
The Super Bowl is in their home town this year, it would be cool for them to win it at home.
Yeah, that would be perfect.
It has never happened yet, winning at home.
Maybe this is the year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you have a favorite football team growing up?
Yeah, the Minnesota Vikings. I liked to their quarterback, Fran Tarkenton.
Was there a particular game that you remember more than any other?
Yeah, the Heidi bowl. Something I'll never forget.
Never heard of it, what was the Heidi bowl?
A game on TV between the Raiders and the Jets.
Why did they call it the Heidi bowl?
65 seconds left, and NBC switched from the game to the movie Heidi.
Did they think the game was over?
Yeah, but Oakland scored twice in the last nine seconds, giving them a 43 to 32 lead.
Is that how the game ended?
Yeah, the viewers were outraged when they found out that they had missed such a spectacular ending.
I'll bet that never happened again!
Nope. The network executives learned to never again leave a live football game in progress.
What type of game was it? Was it exciting?
By the last minute, the lead had changed eight times.
But, why did it run out of time?
Because of such intensity, there was an unusual amount of penalties and timeouts.
Did it ever happen again?
Shortly after, a clause was inserted into the TV contracts that all games would be broadcast completely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is a better football team: the Baltimore Ravens or the Pittsburgh Steelers?
I'd that the Steelers are a lot better. Frankly, it's not even close.
Really? I agree that the Steelers are probably better, but it's not by a significant margin.
The Steelers have the best wide receiver in the NFL in Antonio Brown, the best running back in the NFL in Le'Veon Bell, and Ben Roethlisberger, who is a future hall of famer.
Regarding Ben Roethlisberger, the man is 35 and is beginning to think about retirement. He probably has three seasons left in him, maximum.
Who would you rather have as your quarterback then, Ben Roethlisberger or Joe Flacco?
To be honest, Flacco. He's much healthier and a much better quarterback in January.
Really? Flacco has only one Super Bowl appearance while Roethlisberger has three.
Yeah, but Roethlisberger has no Super Bowl MVPs and Flacco has one.
Super Bowl MVPs are an arbitrary metric. What matters more is Pro Bowl selections and Flacco has none.
That's a totally legitimate criticism of Flacco, but I'm talking about his potential for this season.
Let's put that issue aside for now. You still haven't addressed either Antonio Brown or Le'Veon Bell.
Le'Veon Bell is good when healthy but his physical playing style leaves him too susceptible to injury. My concerns with Antonio Brown tend to deal more with his off field maturity.
Are you referring to the locker room Facebook video incident following the Kansas City playoff game?
Yeah. Not only does it show that he doesn't take his job seriously, but it sheds light on Mike Tomlin's inability to keep his players disciplined.
While that situation was not ideal, I think it was overblown by the media. Furthermore, I don't understand your criticism of Mike Tomlin.
Tomlin is an overrated coach who inherited a Super Bowl winning team from Bill Cowher. He is very unprofessional and was caught on a nationally televised game attempting to interfere with a kickoff return.
I disagree entirely with that statement. Tomlin has been head coach for ten seasons now and the team has had seven playoff appearances during his tenure.
Can you address the kick off interference incident during the Thanksgiving game?
It was an honest mistake and the NFL did not find that it warranted giving up draft picks, which sort of clears him. However, I'll acknowledge that he did have to pay a hefty fine for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Bills have a shot this year?
Not a chance. Tyrod Taylor hasn't done much of anything.
He went to the Pro Bowl and doesn't throw any interceptions.
But he also doesn't throw for many yards. Sammy Watkins is going to waste on that team.
With Watkins healthy this year, he should get at least 1,200 yards.
If he stays healthy. That's a huge if.
And what about LeSean McCoy? Shady should have another fantastic year.
Pinning your hopes on an aging running back is never a good idea.
Well look at the defense. They added Micah Hyde and should be a lot better.
They also lost Stephon Gilmore at cornerback. That's a huge loss.
Well the new coaching staff is all about discipline and that will make a big difference.
Rex Ryan was garbage last year, I'll give you that, but Sean McDermott is no miracle worker.
And the new front office will start bringing in the right people and turn the team around.
They've been saying that since 2000. Nothing there will ever change.
Don't be such a pessimist. This is the year the 17-year playoff drought ends.
They've also been saying THAT forever.
When Tyrod is leading the Bills on a game-winning drive in the playoffs, you'll feel pretty stupid.
When Tyrod is doing that, who will you be playing against in your Madden video game?
Very funny. I'm telling you, the Bills will be in the playoffs.
In an AFC East that has the Patriots and Dolphins? I doubt it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like watching football?
Yes! I am a huge fan!
Awesome! What is your favorite team?
The Patriots! What about yours?
My favorite team is the Eagles. They never get very far but I have to stay loyal.
Yeah that's true. I'm lucky to root for a team that has been successful but I agree. If my team never got very far I couldn't imagine switching for that reason.
Yeah winning isn't everything but it does get pretty exciting.
And it gets pretty frustrating when we never win.
Yeah I hear you. So who do you think will get far in this upcoming season?
Well it's no surprise that the Patriots are looking promising. But the Packers and Steelers are looking pretty good too.
Yeah, I think the Seahawks have potential too.
I'm really excited for this season, we'll see who makes it to the Superbowl.
Yeah the Superbowl is pretty great, but I enjoy the whole season leading up to the Superbowl too.
Yeah of course, the Superbowl is the height of it but the whole season is pretty enjoyable.
Especially when teams that look promising go against each other, things get crazy!
Yeah I also really enjoy watching it with friends and family and make an event out of it.
Of course! The social aspect of it is all part of the fun!
I agree, it's all pretty exciting. Can't wait for this season.
Same here, the anticipation is killing me.
It'll be great. I wonder who will end up in the Superbowl. It's always hard to guess because you never know what'll happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the 49ers?
I used to
Why did you stop?
Rice left
He was great
Best wide receiver ever
Do you like them at all?
They are okay
Did you see them face the Ravens?
Yes
Were you disappointed?
Yes
I hope they get back to the Super Bowl
Me too
They have a good team I think
Same here. But, I do not like their coaching
That could use some work
They play in a great stadium though
It is one of the best
They have great fans
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the new orleans saints?
Yes they are an okay team
I agree
When was the last time they won a superbowl
2010
Thats not too bad
No
Hopefukly they get there again soon
Yes i hope so
They should they have a decent coach
Who is that
Sean payton
Oh alright
Yes
And they have a good quarterback
Which one
Drew brees
Oh yea he is pretty good
I like him
Good
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the new season start?
In early September.
What is your favorite team?
I don't really have a favorite team.  What about you?
The Steelers.
Do you think they will be good this year.
I do, the roster looks good again, so I'm hopeful.
That's cool.  I'm excited to see how some of the rookies play this year.
Yeah, normally rookies don't have a huge impact.  But last year Dallas had 2 rookies that had huge seasons.
You mean Elliot and Sheppard?
Yes.  I don't remember two rookies on a team having a bigger impact.
I don't either.
Do you watch much of preseason?
I usually don't.
Yeah, I only watch some of the Hall of fame game most years.
I've seen that before.  I do watch a lot of highlights on ESPN during that time.
I do that too, or read on Apple news.
That's a good idea, I could add a lot of sports to that app.
Do you go to games in person often?  I don't, but I'm not close to one.
I've been before, but I don't go often.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to be MVP this season?
Too early to tell, but probably a QB or RB .... Aaron Rodgers maybe.
Who has the best defense?
Probably New England or Pittsburg.
Who has the best passing game in the NFC?
I gotta go with Drew Brees in New Orleans.
You don't think he's getting too old?
Not yet, he's got 2 or 3 seasons left.... maybe 4 if he doesn't get injured.
Who's got the best running game?
Probably Denver, they always produce a 1,000 yd RB.
The kicker is the most important though.
Yeah, who do you think has the best kicker?
Vanderjagt doesn't miss.
What about special teams?
they have their place... it's all part of being a te
Does Tom Brady have what it takes to win again?
For sure .... The Patriots are the super bowl contenders
Do you like the Redskins?
Yeah, I used to live in washington DC...
What happend?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so what´s your favorite NFL team?
It was San Diego Chargers.
What do you mean it was?
Oh, because they are moving to LA.
No way! I did not know. So who is staying in San Diego.
Apparently, no one, we are very sad.
So will you still root for them?
No, I changed teams, now I am a fan of Raiders.
Oh yeah! I heard that they are moving to Vegas. What happened to the Chargers?
They his a couple of bad seasons, they will always do good at first on each game but after halftime they would always lose.
What a bummer. But does´t LA already have a team?
Yes they do! They have the LA Rams, so that will be a mess.
Oh well!. We´ll Im rooting for Denver Broncos.
Oh really? Who is their coach right now?
It´s Vance Joseph.
Oh yes you are right, for the Chargers is now Anthony Linn, the previous one was unfortunately fired.
Do you remember who was the MVP of 2016?
Yes I believe it was Matt Ryan.
You are so right. What team did he played for?
Oh that´s easy, he played for the Falcons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite football team.
My favorite team is the browns.
Why would you like the browns?
I was born and raised a browns fan. I am a loyal, die hard fan. I am not a front runner.
That is a good fan to be. Many fans only root for a team because they are good.
Yes. I for sure am not one of those fans.
Do you think the browns will finally improve this year?
I do like their coach and I think they should stick with him. I also think they did well in the draft but I think it will take a long time.
A lot of people think the owner doesn't know what he is doing.
I'm one of them. He has already failed once by having to start over.
Do you think he can still build a winner?
I'm not sure. He talks the talk but I'm not so sure he knows what he is doing.
What's his biggest flaw?
He's too involved. He needs to leave things up to the pros and stay out of the details.
Do you think he is better than Randy Lerner?
I'm not really sure. Randy lerner at least did everything he could to get the right people involved.
So why didn't he succeed?
I don't know. Sometimes I think this team is cursed. I thought for sure they had something going when they got Holmgren as a GM.
Nobody will ever dispute how difilcult it is to be a browns fan
That is for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is better wide receiver Marvin Harrison or Reggie Wayne?
Marvin had better stats.  So I'd say Marvin.
Reggie Wayne was a beast.
Reggie Wayne was great, but Marvin is an all time great.
So you would rather have Marvin Harrison on your team than Reggie Wayne.
No, I rather have Reggie but I think Marvin had a better career.
Why would you rather have Reggie on your team?
Reggie was a taller guy.  I like tall receivers.
Marvin wasn't that big of a guy, was he?
They both were 6 foot tall but Reggie played like a big receiver.
What do you mean?
Reggie would out jump people and make himself a bigger target.
What about Marvin?
Marvin Harrison was more of route runner.
Route runner what do you mean?
Marvin would make great cuts to get open but if the ball wasn't a good throw Marvin wasn't going to get it.
I guess that's why Peyton Manning to Marvin Harrison was so deadly.
Peyton was so accurate in his younger years Marvin just had to run the route and Peyton would hit him.
So why didn't Reggie have bigger stats?
Reggie's first few years he was the number 2 guy behind Marvin Harrison.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Todd Gurley will be able to bounce back after last year's disappointing season?
I like Todd Gurley a lot but I think he's really overrated since his breakout rookie season.
I think he's really talented and skilled as a runner but I think the Ram's are just a very bad team.
The Rams definitely need a lot of help and a lot of new talent. Their team was so one dimensional last year that defenses just stacked the line to play Gurley.
I think their former coach Jeff Fisher was to blame for that. They were so conservative in their offensive play calling that it made everything they did so predictable for defenses.
It also didn't help that they put Jared Goff in there as a rookie mid way through the season.
Yeah, Goff was definitely a deer in headlights. He wasn't ready for the moment and you could see him just not quite up to NFL game speed.
It's hard for young quarterbacks to step in and make a difference especially when you do not have a lot of talent around you.
The Rams definitely need wide receiver help. That was a huge disappointment last year.
Kenny Britt was their best receiver. When Kenny is your top choice, you know you have wide receiver problems.
I think the Rams defense was really good last year though.
That's the one hope they have and they've done a great job in drafting prospects to help them in that department.
They probably have one of the best defenses in the NFC I would have to say.
Their defensive front line is so strong and so quick. They have good linebackers and their secondary is one of the top in the league.
I'm hoping Todd Gurley will be able to find some holes in the defense to run through this year. It was frustrating to watch him get stuffed at the line on every run last season.
That's what I mean by predictable offense. There was no threat to throw so defenses didn't have to really worry about complex offenses.
Do you think Jared Goff will start again this season for them.
I think so they basically sold a large portion of their future to make him be the franchise quarterback of the future for them so they have to stick with him.
What do you predict their regular season record to be next season?
I think the Rams will be 5-11. They'll improve and keep games close similar to last season but I think they'll fall just short again and have a similar record to last season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!
Oh?  Who's your favorite team?
All hail the Patriots!
How in all that is holy can you like that team?
Haha...
No, really.  They cheat!
Allegedly...
No, they literally cheat!
How so?
The deflated ball incident?
See, that was unproven
Still, we all know it happened!
It's just accusations at this point
....
But you must admit that they are a good team even if I give you the deflated ball incident.
Well they did win the Superbowl
Exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the superbowl halftime show this past year?
It was okay. I am not a Lady GaGa fan.
She kept it tasteful though.
She did. I will give her that.
Did you even watch the game? I didn't.
I did watch it. I love my Falcons.
Oh, so the ending stinks for you.
Yeah, but it's OK. My husband was upset for weeks though.
That is just crazy.
No, he is just passionate about the game.
Yeah, my man likes football too, but I won't let him act crazy about it.
Well, he didn't act crazy. He was just upset.
Why is it a big deal?
If you are really a fan then you devote a lot of yourself to the team. You want to see them do well.
I get that, but it is just a game.
It is a game, but not just a game.
I don't understand.
That would be like tell you that you MK purse is just a bag.
Oh, now you are talking crazy;.
I am just trying to help you understand.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how are you doing this evening?
I am doing good, just counting down the days until football season!
I know what you mean there, I can not wait!
Who do you think will be the best team in the NFL this year?
That is a tough call. I would have to say the Patriots.
Do you think they will repeat?
I really do, they are so good year after year.
That is a smoothly ran organization from top to bottom.
It really is, and that is why you see the results from them on the field every season.
I have a good feeling about the Falcons this year, I think they might get back to the Superbowl for the second straight year.
I still can not believe they let that huge lead they had over the Patriots get away this past Superbowl!
I know, how many points were they up exactly?
They were actually leading by twenty five points in the third quarter!
Wow, that has to be considered the best comeback in NFL history.
It is the best one that I have ever seen without a doubt.
I feel that Matt Ryan will get another shot at it though.
I actually would not mind seeing a Patriot and Falcons rematch for this upcoming Superbowl.
Me either, I bet it would be another classic if those two squared off again.
I feel that the Falcons will be contenders as long as they have Ryan at quarterback, and Julio Jones at receiver.
Yea, Jones is the best receiver in football as far as I am concerned.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new uniforms
yeah
so what do you think?
meh
meh? what do you mean meh?
They just don't excite me
they don't excite you?
no they don't
why not?
I'm just not feeling them
but they glow in the dark!!!
when are football players ever in the dark?
its not about them, its about the one you buy
did you already buy one?
yeah, I got two
you got two
yeah, my two favorite players
well don't wear it around me
i got you one too
smh
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL draft should be coming up soon. Are you excited?
Yeah, though I don't know how my Saints are going to do this year.
Oh, I didn't know you were a Saints fan.
Yeah, Brees is arguably the best quarterback in the league so I represent them to the fullest!
Yeah, he's good but he's no Tom Brady. That's the team I'm looking forward to.
The Patriots are a force but I feel like their time is up. You wait, my Saints are going to do great this year.
I feel like Saints fans say that every year, but who knows.
That's funny, but yes I am excited for the season and ready to see what each team can bring this year.
Other than the Saints, what other teams do you like?
I'm a fan of the Seahawks, as Marshawn Lynch is a beast.
That he is, I'm sure even Brady was worried about facing him.
Well, now that he's back with the Raiders it's definitely going to be a problem.
Oh, I forgot all about that! The NFL just got more entertaining now.
Yeah, other than the Saints I'm definitely excited to watch him smash through defenses again.
That's always a highlight of the sport huh?
It certainly is. That and the way they can throw the ball so far down the field.
Well, I think we only have about a month before we can see other plays be drafted in.
Yeah, I always enjoy seeing fresh talent perform with the old ones. We saw how the Cowboys did with that.
Absolutely, and they only show signs of getting better.
Only time will tell, that's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the NFL?
It's okay.
What do you like about it?
I like the Super Bowl.
Plenty of people watch it.
I love the commercials.
Yeah, I have had people over to watch it before.
The playoffs are more fun to watch.
I like any of the games.
The playoffs are more competitive.
A stadium full of people must be exciting.
It would be great to go to.
It would also be fun for the athletes.
Have you ever been to an NFL stadium?
I've been to the Tennessee Titan's stadium, but not for a game.
The NFL has plenty of fans.
Yeah, the stadiums are really big.
Yeah, they are one of the first structures you notice in a city.
It is fun to predict who will win.
It's always hard to tell.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who owes the Washington Redskins?
I think Daniel Snyder does.
Bruce Allen is the president.
They don't have a general manager right now.
Head coach is Jay Grunden.
I think they used to be the Boston Braves.
Then I think Boston Redskins.
The Skins is their nick name.
They have 5 League championships.
They have 2 NFL championships.
They won 3 Super Bowls.
They got 3 Conference championships.
And they have 14 Division championships.
Don't forget 24 playoff appearances.
Their first home field was Braves Field.
Then Fenway Park.
I miss Griggith Stadium.
RFK Stadium was cool.
They have played more than 1000 games since 1932.
That is a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Henry Pines?
Of course!
He plays for the Indians now.
He does?
Yes, he was switched last month.
That may be a good match.
I think it will.
How's it going so far?
He's doing well.
Is he adjusted?
I think so.
It hasn't been long.
Right.  I'll give him 6 months and check back.
That team has had changes lately.
Yes, 3 new players.
That's a big change.
I hope they come out strong!
The new players seem to fit well.
Good.
Yes, they lucked out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so excited today!
Why is that?
It is just about a month until the first preseason NFL game!
That is exciting, it is about time football start back up.
Who is your team?
I like the Kansas City Chiefs.
They have been doing better the last few years, no?
They have. It has been fun to be a fan.
Too bad they haven't been able to make it to the Super Bowl.
I know. I think we just need some more consistency.
Well, hopefully they do better this year.
Who is your time?
I like the Green Bay Packers.
They do well pretty consistently, no?
They do, but kind of like the Chiefs we haven't been able to put together a Super Bowl run lately.
When was the last time they were in the big game?
I believe it was 2011.
Yeah, it has been awhile. But you have a lot of great players on your team.
Hopefully Aaron Rogers and Jordy Nelson will be spot on this year.
They are pretty unstoppable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, it is just about a month until the preseason starts.
True. Do you like the preseason?
I mean, I like that there is football on television again, but it is pretty different than the regular season.
I feel the same way.
I am excited for it though.
When does the actual season start?
I think it kicks off on September 7th.
Who plays in that game?
I think it is the Chiefs versus the Patriots.
Who will you be going for in that game?
I will for sure be pulling for the Chiefs.
Same here.
I mean, they are not even "my team". I just really do not like the Patriots.
Why is that?
I think they are kind of cocky. I have nothing personal against them really, they just win too much.
I can see that. I want to see some diversity in who goes to the big game.
I would love to see some very unlikely teams.
Wouldn't it be great if it were someone like the Browns versus the Titans?
That would be something!
Or even better, the Browns versus the Bengals. It's an Ohio showdown!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Detroit Lions!
Oh man that sucks to be you!
Yeah they are not so good right now.
They did have one of the greatest running backs of all time though.
Yeah Barry Sanders was amazing, who is your team?
I like the Green Bay Packers.
Haha so you're a cheese head then.
Yeah, definitely!  I bleed cheese.
Don't remind me of the Aaron Rodgers hail mary from last season.
I could never forget that, I didn't want to bring it up.
Thanks for that, haha.
How do you think the Lions will do this year?
I am hoping they make it back into the playoffs again.
I think they should, Matthew Stafford is a great quarterback.
He just needs help from the Offensive line and they did upgrade that in the off season.
Yeah hopefully they do well!
Indeed, there could be some exciting games.
Well it was nice talking to you!
Take it easy and go Lions!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you planning on going to any Buffalo Bills games this year?
Maybe, I don't know yet.
Are you excited for the new season?
Not really, I'm still kind of burned out from last season.
What makes you say that?
I'm just sick of this team.
So are you just done with them?
I wouldn't say that with any certainty.
Don't you think that the Bills have a chance to go to the playoffs this year?
Not at all.
I can't believe you have given up.
I've been a fan for almost thirty years, and they let me down every single year.
I understand your frustration.
LeSean McCoy is the only great player they have, and we still don't have a good quarterback.
Yes, it's been a long time since we had stable play at that quarterback position.
It's just getting to the point where I look at the Bills and the NFL as businesses that want to take my money.
Well I still have fun and enjoy them.
That's good, but I have a tough time when they don't provide me with any tangible results or services for my money.
That's funny, maybe you shouldn't follow the team or the league anymore.
I have felt this way for close to ten years, and this year might be the year I stop watching or supporting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Jamal Adams got drafted by the Jets?
I did. I think he's going to have a great Rookie year.
He was amazing for LSU.
Let's hope that carries over to the NFL
Are there any other rookies you think will be good?
I think Rueben Foster is going to be impressive
Who was he drafted by?
The 49ers.
I always liked the 49ers
Hopefully they'll make it to the playoffs this year.
I think Christian Mcaffery is going to be great too
I think he can help Cam Newton a lot
They could for sure go to the playoffs with the two of them
Mcaffery will be a nightmare to cover.
For sure. Defensively he's a great player
And on offense too.
Seems like everyone has to be great at both these days
For sure. I think Steve Smith did it really well.
He was a beast
And a fighter too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?  Less than two months until the regular season kickoff!
You know it!  There are so many story lines to follow with players changing teams and exciting rookies coming into the league.
What player changing teams are you most excited to see?  And which do you think will have the biggest impact?
Wow so many to choose from!  Marshawn Lynch to the Raiders, AP to the Saints, Jamaal Charles to the Broncos, and Alshon Jeffrey to the Eagles are the ones I'm most excited to see!
I'm excited to see how Lynch does after his brief retirement.  Do you think he still has some Beast Mode left in him?
Definitely!  I can't wait to see him eating Skittles on the sidelines and running over defensive backs.  Remember his run in the Super Bowl a few years ago?  Simply amazing!
Oh man definitely Beast Mode at his finest.  I think the league missed having a character around like him.  I'm excited to see how he does with the Raiders.  What other story lines are you following?
I'm interested to see if Colin Kaepernick or Jay Cutler end up signing somewhere or not.  All it will take is a major injury for a star quarterback and maybe one of them will be back.  What about you?
I'm excited to see how some of the rookies do at the next level, as well as to see if the Dallas Cowboys can continue their success with Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliot running the show.
I agree.  I don't think the Cowboys will be as good as they were last year, but I'm excited to see if I'm right or wrong.
I'm just excited for the National Football League to be back in my life period.  Fantasy football, watching shows about football, listening to podcasts about football, I'm ready for it all.  Who are you taking to win the Super Bowl?
I think going with the New England Patriots to repeat is a no brainer.  It seems like they just keep getting better and better with their acquisitions and Tom Brady showing no signs of slowing down.  Who are you taking?
I think the smart choice is the Patriots, but I think the Falcons will come back hungry and with a huge chip on their shoulder.  I also like the Seahawks to have a strong season.
There are a lot of tough teams and that just makes it more exciting and has me more and more pumped up as the season inches closer and closer.
How do you feel about all the issues surrounding concussions in the league?  It seems like it is a story that won't go away but one that probably shouldn't go away anytime soon.
There definitely still needs to be some changes made in the protocol.  Hearing offseason stories like Tom Brady's wife saying he has had multiple concussions but never appearing on the injury report for them is concerning.
I agree.  It's scary hearing about all the retired players suffering from CTE and the recent story about Warren Sapp feeling like he is already dealing with issues at a young age make me think things need to change.
Definitely.  Hopefully the steps will begin when children begin playing football at a young age.  Back to the actual game, who do you think will win the MVP award?
As much as I hate to say it, I think you have to go with Tom Brady playing a full season.  His stats are going to be ridiculous like usual.  What about you?
I agree, but I think Ezekiel Elliot is going to tear it up in his second year.  I saw him in the ESPN Body Issue and he looks ripped and ready to punish some defenses!  I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
First question, most obvious question, what should the LA Rams do with the No. 1 pick?
If you're asking what WILL the Rams do with the No. 1 pick, I think it's going to be stunning if they pick anyone other than Jared Goff at this point. Vegas has him as an incredible 1-to-15 favorite, and it makes sense from a whole lot of other angles as well.
As for what SHOULD they do? I think one can still make a strong argument for Carson Wentz, though I'm inclined to lean toward Goff in this phrasing too.
Well, if the Rams followed my advice, they wouldn't have traded for the top pick in the first place. They've clearly settled on Jared Goff, and he's definitely the more NFL-ready of the top-two quarterbacks. I still think Carson Wentz might have a higher ceiling. But in terms of winning right now, which the Rams have to do, Goff is the guy
Jack, what will fans like about Jared Goff?
I think he's the kind of guy that's not going to get shaken easily. It's not going to get much worse for him than what happened at Cal when he was a freshman, what with going 1-11 and all.
He definitely has a presence in the pocket that's unlike any other quarterback in this class. In fact, his pocket presence might be better than any QB in the last few drafts.
I talked to him last summer about that 2013 season, and what struck me was when he said that -- as bad as that season went -- he always believed he was the best player on the field. He said this while recognizing that it wasn't always true objectively, but stressed that that kind of self-confidence was important to his success.
Goff is used to playing with 4 WR's in a spread system. He might not have four WR's that belong on an NFL roster with the Rams offense, let alone on the field at one time.
That's a fair concern, though Goff did have a lot of control over playcalling in his final season.
And I don't want to be the guy who brings up his small hands, but ... well ... looks like I'm that guy.
The best "Air Raid" quarterback is probably ... Johnny Manziel? Who was pretty exciting to watch until his life careened into substance abuse problems and domestic violence allegations. Totally different QB than Goff is though.
You could make an argument that Case Keenum might be the best Air Raid QB in the NFL right now, honestly
And yeah, Jared Goff's hand size probably played a role in him fumbling the ball 23 times at Cal, but he did manage to cut that number down to 4 in his last season.
I think the hand size thing is probably less of an issue given that he'll be playing in Los Angeles rather than Cleveland.
I will say that I think the hand-size argument is a little overblown. Tony Romo has similarly small hands, too.
Case Keenum might be! And he honestly could open the season as the starter too. I don't think it'd shock anyone if the Rams waited a few weeks to throw in Goff.
I don't see a world where they wait on Jared Goff past Week 1.
This is true. Case Keenum isn't the one making an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel later this week.
That's great a discussion. Something tells me we, and Rams fans everywhere, will be talking about this draft for a long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Seahawks may just be trending downwards.
Yea, they still have a great defense, but you could be right.
Do you have faith in Russell Wilson?
I do, but he isn't the kind of guy to lead a team alone.
Well nobody really is, but I know what you mean.
Yea, but I mean like a Flacco. Great quarterback, but you need a defense and playmakers.
I understand. Wilson still has a couple receivers and a tight end so he may still be good.
Yea, they will still compete, but I'm not sure they have enough.
Speaking of Flacco. How about the Ravens?
Eh, they added Maclin this year, but I think they have more holes than that.
Yea, I agree. They probably can't top the Steelers.
Yea, the Steelers are still contenders, aren't they?
They sure are and they have a great time again.
Yea, well if Leveon Bell can get his act together and stop getting suspended.
Yea, I hope he can get himself straightened out. He is too good of a running back.
Yea, especially when he is on the field.
Yea, with Roethlisberger, him, and Brown, they should be a force.
Yea, I agree. Thats a great trio!
Yea, it is. Just always question Big Ben's health.
Yea, he does seem to be prone to injury sometimes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about Colin Kaepernick?
An emotional adolescent who has lived a spoiled life.
And low IQ.
Yes, low IQ, and full of ignorance.
Any chance he plays anywhere this year?
No flippin' way. This is a business.
You darn right it's a business.
Yes, when you continually disrespect your employer and the organization that your employer belongs to then you get fired.
That is 100% correct sir.
Hey, what do you think about Goodell?
Well, he's an overpaid CEO but I don't have any issue with that.
So what's his problem?
He is too tolerant in reference to shenanigans. He chooses media attention over his customer base.
I couldn't agree with you more.
If you think about it though, do you really care about this stuff?
No, not really.
I mean some of it aggravates me, but the product that is produced is awesome every single week.
The NFL is an awesome entity.
Yes, it certainly is.
May God bless American football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Because, what do the running backs do?
Um, they rush.
Yes, do you need a lot of intelligence to hold on to the ball tight and run?
That's not what running backs do.
That's exactly what running backs do
No it's not. Running back to have to assess spatial relations between themselves and the defensive line, and the safeties too, That takes a lot of thinking
Ok, then how was Frank Gore such a great rusher?
For crying outloud. Maybe he blew off the test too. Besides, RBs score about 16. We're not talking about a 4 here.
Oh wait, so 10 is being barely literate.
20 is average, so 16 is... below... average.
Hahaha. I was right. This test sucks.
No it doesn't. Anything that provides a quatifiable information doesn't suck
Quantify this
That's just so mature. Seriously. By taking the assessing the mental dimensions, you can improve the game a lot.
Yes I get that. But why publish all this though?
Why publish their combine data? It's just all data.
But it's embarassing.
There is nothing embarassing about your Wonderlic score if you're in the NFL making millions.
Huh. Yeah, give me 40 million and a brain that's only capable of scoring a 10.
Yeah, no, you wouldn't be happy with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the NFL's rookie of the year for 2017-2018?
Oh that's a tough one. I think there are a few contenders, but that Christian McCaffrey will be the rookie of the year.
I think he and Fournette will be some of the most dynamic playmaking rookies of the year, but I wonder who will be more successful?
McCaffrey is going to a team with a good quarterback who needs to be flanked by a running game.
Yeah, the Panthers really missed having a good running game last season and it showed.
Ron relied too much on Cam Newton to make plays and after he got hurt, he wasn't the same.
Cam's body is too big to move the way they want him to, so having a running game will take the pressure off of his legs.
Yeah, it's likely that McCaffrey will bring a lot to the team, I just hope the offensive line is healthy and can block.
McCaffrey didn't have the best offensive line when he was in school, but he is fast and smart.
You could tell that at the combine and from draft analysis.
I read one scouting report about how he has some of the best footwork in the nfl!
It's hard to make a statement like that before he has even taken a snap, but I am excited to see how he compares to some of the better vets.
It's tough to believe that he will have a year like Zeke Elliot had last year.
Of course Zeke had a good year, the Cowboys have the best offensive line in the nfl!
That's true, but rushing as much as he did, it was also his skills that made him have all of those 100 yards plus games.
He didn't quite get the 2000 yards that he was hoping to, but I think that's because the defenses he faced figured out the Cowboy's game plan and adjusted.
Yeah, he didn't really add anything new to his playbook during the season, but I think his blocking got better as it progressed.
Not sure that blocking really plays a factor in nfl rookie of the year consideration, but maybe that's the edge McCaffrey will need.
I think he can really stand out as a pass catcher, not just as someone running between the tackles.
Well, Cam is going to need all the offensive weapons he can so that he can stay a lot healthier this upcoming season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the SUPERBOWL?
I didn't like who won,but I liked the game.
Not a patriots fan?
No I'm not.
I'm not either.
Who do you like?
I'm a Giants fan.
Only team New England can't beat in the SUPERBOWL.
That is correct.
What a tremendous comeback though in the SUPERBOWL.
I honestly thought it was over.
So did I.
To blow a lead like that after three quarters is pretty bad.
I think Atlanta kind of beat themselves.
Yea,some iffy play calling.
I also think they ran out of gas.
They might have.
They were flying all over in the first half.
They were all over New England.
It's like New England had no answer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about wide receivers for awhile.  I throw a name out there and you tell me what you think.
Sounds like fun to me!
Antonio Brown
Quick, fast, great hands.  The best all around receiver in the league.
Odell Beckham JR.
Very talented. He has the potential to be one of the greats, but is his own worst enemy.
Julio Jones
Awesome talent, I wish he wasn't hurt all the time.  He'd set records if he was healthy.
Jordy Nelson
Extremely fast and gives 100% all the time.  It helps having Aaron Rodgers throwing to you though.
Dez Bryant
The X man!  He has matured over the last few years.  Studies hard and wants to win.
TY Hilton
Not a very big receiver, but plays big.  Very quick and exciting to watch.
Michael Thomas
Plays with Drew Brees. had a great rookie year, I think he'll be even better this year.
Mike Evans
Solid receiver, I think he scores 12 tds this year.  He's a touchdown machine.
AJ Green
Very underrated.  Probably the best receiver behind Antonio Brown, OBJ, and Julio.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Cardinals have a shot this year?
Yes
They have a good team
I agree
Did you see them in the Super Bowl?
Yes
Who did they play again?
The Steelers
Yes. That was a classic
I agree
I was disappointed they lost.
Me too
What was your favorite play?
That 100 yard return
That was really good
Do you think the Cardinals will ever win it all?
Maybe
What about this year?
It's a tough league
Yes, especially with The Patriots going for a repeat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you catch the game between the Packers and Jaguars?
Yes, I did. It was a good game.
Okay, who won the game?
The Green Bay Packers won by a score of 27 to 23.
Did Rodgers pass for any touchdowns?
Yes, Rodgers had 2 touchdown passes.
How many passes did Rodgers complete?
Rodgers completed 20 passes out of 34 attempts.
What was Rodgers total passing yards?
His total was 199 passing yards.
Did Rodgers throw any interceptions?
No, he did not throw any interceptions.
Okay, who led Green Bay in rushing yards?
Green Bay was led by Eddie Lacy with 61 rushing yards.
Which one of Green Bay's receivers had the most yards?
Randall Cobb led the Packers with 57 receiving yards.
Did Green Bay have any fumbles?
Yes, but it was only one.
Okay, thanks. I'm glad my Packers won the game.
Yea, I forgot how much of a Green Bay fan you are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Steelers will take the division?
Depends on how healthy their players are.
I wonder how many passing yards Big Ben will have this season?
IF he is well protected by his offense and his receivers are good, he will do well.
What do you think about the Patriots this year?
I think they can have a winning season but winning the Super Bowl again, not sure.
How do you think the Bears will do in their division?
I think they will not be so lucky with the Vikings and Green Bay iin their division.
The AZ Cardinals have come close a few times but blow it.
Yeah, depends on how well they play as a team and if they stay healthy.
What are your thoughts on the Broncos this year?
I think they had their time and it's someone else's turn now.
What do you think about having three teams in the LA area now?
I think the crowds will not be like they used to due to the number of teams there.
Who do you think will be in the Super Bowl?
I am thinking maybe Green Bay and Dallas.
Do you think the Cowboys will do well?
I think they have a good quarterback now so let's see how they do.
DO you think Cleveland will ever have a winning team again?
Not likely based on their picks year after year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know which 2 players have caught, rushed, and thrown a touchdown against the same team in the same game?
Walter Payton in 1979 and David Patton in 2001. It's pretty incredible! Only 2!
Yep! It's weird to think that football games usually last around 3 hours, the ball is typically in play for only 11 minutes.
Wow. That means the game on TV is devoted mostly to replays.
An NFL game is about 75 minutes, but about 60% of total TV air time, is spent on shots of players standing on the line of scrimmage, huddling, or just walking around between snaps.
I did not even notice that.
Yeah, during broadcast NFL games, cheerleaders are on TV for only about 3 seconds. Coaches and referees receive around 7% of the face time in a game.
That's crazy.
In the 1930s, NFL game telecasts were just a constant feed of the field. Instant replay became commonplace in the mid-1960s, which helped fill the idle moments of the game.
I guess with the new tech of TV things began to change.
Yeah, the perspective for fans could be altered.
It's great I love getting those detailed plays.
By the 1990s, some football broadcasts showed about 100 replays per game.
That's a lot.
Yeah, I'm more aware when I watch that that is the case.
I like the replays for me it enhances the experience.
Yeah, that and high def TVs. Oh and surround sound! It's like being on the field!
Still there is nothing like actually being at the game.
Yeah, I love being in the crowd and all that excitement.
The stadiums are so high tech. There really aren't any bad seats to catch all those great plays!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Marshawn Lynch coming back to the NFL?
Yes.  I think it should be an exciting season.
What do you think about him playing for the Raiders?
That is his hometown team, correct?
Yes, Marshawn grew up in that area.
I think it's great.  Playing at home is probably really exciting for him.
Yes.  I know the Raider fans are glad to have him.
I think he retired too soon anyway.
It was kind of surprising when he retired from the Seahawks.
Was he unhappy there or something?
I really don't know.  They won the superbowl and then lost it on one play the following season.
Yes.  The play was so horrible.
They should have ran the ball with Lynch.
Maybe he took that pretty hard and retired because of it.
It probably was not that one thing but maybe that was the straw that broke the camels back.
Well I am just glad to see him play again.  He is a pretty exciting running back.
I really wonder if he lost a step in retirement.
I wonder that too.  I wonder if I knew he was coming back and keep in shape from the beginning.
The season starts in about two months so we will see.
Yes.  I really can't wait for the start of this NFL season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ryan Shaizer can only get better from here, guys! Go Steelers!
I've been saying this for a while: Ryan Shazier is the best run stopper in the NFL.
I don't recall many ball carriers breaking Shazier's tackles.
Yup. If he made contact, the ball carrier went down.
Shaz goes all in for the tackles, so it's easier to be juked by the carrier.
But when he hits, he hits hard.
People often bring up missed tackles when talking about Shazier. He's a risk taker.
That's why it's called a risk.
He's an All-Pro if he stays on the field for all 16 games.
He does get hurt a lot...
My Ravens fan buddy talking smack. He said he also lead the league in missed tackles per attempt.
Tell your buddy to stop hating.
They hate us cuz they ain't us.
Ha Ha! All day every day!
He goes through the O-Line like a knife through butter.
I am thinking he is gonna have a big big year.
Yup. All-Pro or bust!
He has potential to be a lifelong all pro
Shazier is the best player on a pretty young and talented defense.
He's getting there. Zeus is still King
XXXXXXXXXXX
ARE YOU AN NFL FAN?
YES I AM.  NOT A HUGH FAN BUT I ENJOY IT.
HOW IS YOUR FAVORITE TEAM?
I LIKE THE CAROLINA PANTHERS
WHY DO YOU LIKE THEM.
I AM FROM AND LIVE IN NC SO PULL FOR THE HOME TEAM.
I AM A BIG COLTS FAN.
MY WIFE IS FROM INDIANAPOLIS SO WE PULL FOR THEM ALSO.
I THINK ANDREW LUCK WILL HAVE A GOOD SEASON
LAST TIME WE WERE IN INDIANAPOLIS, WE COULD SEE THE STADIUM RIGHT OUT OUR HOTEL WINDOW.
I WENT TO ONE GAME LAST YEAR WHEN THEY PLAYED THE SAINTS.
I DIN'T GET TO A PANTHERS GAME THIS YEAR.  I WATCHED MOST OF THEM ON TV.
DO YOU FOLLOW ANY OTHERS TEAMS?
NOT REALLY, BUT I LIKE OTHER PLAYERS.
WHICH PLAYERS ARE THOSE?
I LIKE RUSSELL WILSON AND PHILLIP RIVES BECAUSE THEY WENT TO MY ALMA MATER.
BOTH OF THOSE GUYS ARE GREAT QUARTERBACKS.
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE GREAT YEARS.
I JUST HOPE THE COWBOYS STINK.
I HOPE THE FALCONS HAVE A TERRIBLE YEAR.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you thing the Saints are going to do next season?
What city are they from again?
New Orleans, LA is their home town. They play in the Superdome.
That is one of the largest stadiums to play in I think.
Yeah. I think they will do well next season?
Are you sure? Their performance has been dropping off lately.
They have Drew Brees. He's on of the highest ranked quarterbacks in the league.
That's right. He won MVP when they went to the Superbowl.
Yeah, he's pretty amazing.
Yeah, but do you think he'll be able to pull the whole team this year.
They have a great all-around team. They'll be fine.
I though he lost a lot of his receivers this past season?
Yeah, but they picked some good ones at the last draft.
I hope so. Having a killer passing arm doesn't do any good if he has no one to throw to.
That's true. What do you think they will be strongest at, offence or defense?
Defense for sure.
They haven't had an amazing defense since the 1990s. They need points.
Maybe, but you have to stop the other team from scoring to win.
True. I still think the offence will be their strong suit.
I guess we'll see when the season starts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best RB ever?
Wow, that's some tough competition.
Oh sure.  You can make a case for a number of guys.
For me, I'll go with Jim Brown.
He was definitely a load to bring down.  A man among boys when he played.
Right, they couldn't stop him.
I'm not sure how well he would match up these days though.  Players are much bigger, stronger, faster.
Fair point I guess.
I would give the edge to Barry Sanders.
Hard to knock you on that.
To me, he was the best back ever even if he doesn't have many records.
Playing on a bad line didn't help him out.
He was so shifty though.  Can you imagine how well he would have done with a better line?
You mean one like Emmitt Smith had?
Right.  A good OL makes all the difference.
Within reason.  I mean, Smith had a great line, but he was also a great back.
Not discounting him, just saying it's easier to get yards when you have huge lanes to run through.
And Sanders never really had that advantage.
Exactly.  I bet he would have the single season and career record with a better group.
Guess we'll never know for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
this season should be awesome!
yeah, i think this is the bears year
no way, I think dallas has this.
maybe, but last year proved they were not ready
well, the injuries were a factor, hopefully that wont be the case this year
hopefully, it was a mess last season
but the bears? I do not think they have a chance
the coach has learned a lot, so i think they'll be ok
yea, but to contend with these other teams?
I know, but you have to have faith
honestly, it will probably be the patriots again...
haha, yeah, maybe. Brady is unstoppable.
sure seems that way, that guy is a monster!
Its unreal how they win so easily
well, the whole patriots team is stellar
definitely, an all star line up
I think they definitely have at least one more in them
yeah, I can see that, with how they have been dominating the last decade
think the raiders and chargers might give them a run for their money
The seahawks may have a chance also
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where is the Super Bowl going to be this season?
Up in Minneapolis.
Oh, at the new stadium?
Yeah, it's called the U.S. Bank Stadium.
I couldn't remember the name.
The only reason i remembered was cause i was reading an article on it.
Any predictions on who is gonna go all the way this season?
Well, obviously New England is a contender.
Miami went to the playoffs last season.
Yeah, but they choked.
Like the Cowboys did.
Well, between the whole Romo disaster and all, i did not expect them to get far in the playoffs.
That's true.
No one made it hard for the Patriots to win last season.
Hopefully they make it hard for them THIS season.
That would be nice.
I'd like to see Tampa or Miami try to go all the way this year.
Really? i was thinking more like the Redskins turn it around.
Washington? Highly dobtful.
Why do you say that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
This NFL season is gonna be hella fun!
Hells yeah!
Who's gonna win the Pro Bowl?
Not sure.
What about the All-Star Bowl?
Meh. What about the Rams?
No.
What else is new?
In Tennis, Roger Federer came back!
Seriously!
Yeah, he's pretty well-known throughout all-sports!
How so?
He's like a tennis god!
More like a legend!
What do you mean?
I never heard of him!
Dude, if Brady knows Federer, you should too!
Same
What about Nadal?
Same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so ready for NFL to start back up.
Me too!
Who is your team?
I like the New Orlean Saints.
Oh no!
What's wrong?
I am an Atlanta Falcons fan.
Oh, that's not cool.
Yeah, I can't handle the Saints.
Uh, I can't handle the Falcons.
Maybe we should talk about something besides football?
Nah, we can keep it civil.
I think so too.
You do know that we going to have a team this year. Like a good one.
You do know we are going after that ring this year?
Yeah, how did that work out for you last year?
Well, there was only one other team there, and it wasn't your guys.
It didn't look like yours showed up either.
I will give you that. It was ugly.
Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Sometimes watching the NFL really bothers me.
What? Why?
Because of the lack of color options for the uniforms.
Be serious.
I am.
I thought you were going to talk about something important like injuries. Not uniform colors.
It's important to me! It really bothers me.
What exactly bothers you about it?
There are so many teams that share colors.
So?
so each team should have original colors. Not 100 teams being blue and white.
I don't understand why it matters. It's just colors.
Both the cowboys and the Giants shouldn't be blue. They're supposed to be their own teams.
They are their own teams.
If they are, they should be different.
We would run out of colors eventually.
If they have to be blue, they should all have to use a different shade of blue.
Some do that.
Well, then they can't say 'blue' they should say 'teal'.
you're ridiculous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Buffalo Bills.
What about them?
7 and 9 last season, didnt make the playoffs.
Yes, but how do they look this season?
Well, they didn't get any good draft pics.
They did get Anquan Boldin.
Yes, and he is a good wide reciever but a team needs more than just that.
True. Hopefully it will bring up their stats.
Well, after twelve interceptions last year they need him to work with the QB to reduce those numbers.
We'll know in 90 or so days.
Yes, hopefully they are working on their blockers as well.
They need to get their qb up in to Winston class.
HA, i dont see that happening but thats the same problem the bucs have, good QB bad recievers.
I agree.
Adolphus Washington needs to keep the rushers awah from their QB.
Well, Adolphus was crushing it last season.
He was but again, one or two people cant run an entire team.
Yeah, but every bit helps.
I still think of that time Giants crushed them.
They played at the old Tampa stadium then, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's not racism, right?
Of course not. Blacks make up, what, 13% of America? They make up 70% of the NFL.
That is NOT racism.
But there is a difference in the positions they gravitate towards.
Running backs are 86% black
And wide receivers are 91% black
And, the corners. cornerbacks are 96% black
And the safeties are 90% black.
Maybe It has to do with genes.
Probably, and since much of physical movements needed in NFL are biomechanically analyzable, we can even quantify the traits.
Kinesiology
Yep and there are experts in NFL who specialize in Kinesiology
They probably have the meaurements down to a science, like the leg length, arm length, muscle strength, speed. etc
The reason black sprinters dominate the Olympics because they have long legs and higher center of gravity
How does that help?
Well, running isn't just applying muscle power, Running is turning potential eneergy in your body into kinetic energy..
So.. how does that help?
it helps because higher center of gravity means more mass on top to store as potential energy
Oh... So more potential energy, more... kinetic energy?
Which means they're faster.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you do to improve the NFL?
I think the biggest thing that needs to be fixed is the overtime rule.
Yeah it could use a little work.
The biggest problem I have is that a touchdown wins but not a field goal. Why not have the other team get the ball after a touchdown as well.
The games would probably last to long then.
Maybe they would but a great game can be ended with a kickoff return for a touchdown and it's not fair to the team who lost in that case.
If you can't cover a kick you don't deserve to win.
Yeah but if it's a really good defense against a really good offense they should take the field at least once.
Well what would you do?
I like the college overtime system where each team gets the ball.
They would need to move it back because NFL kickers are a lot better.
Then start it at the 50 yard line each time.
It would never end on a tie then.
That would be the best part, who wants to watch a game that ends in a tie?
Remember when Donovan McNabb didn't even know the rules about ending on a tie?
Yeah he should have known better.
He is paid to play the game he should know the rules.
I think the college rules would make it even more exciting.
Some QBs would really up their stats too. Teams could score 14 points or more in overtime.
It would be ok the stats changed when they changed the games from 14 to 16.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite football player?
I like Tom Brady.
Really.
Yes, why do you not?
No.  I do not care for him at all.
What is your issue with him?
I think he acts like a baby.
That is true.
So you agree.
I agree with how he acts but still a great player.
He is a good player.
Who is your favorite?
I am a fan of Antonio Brown.
He is good.
Heck yes, very fast.
Yes he is.
I am excited for the season to start.
Me as well.
Ready to watch some games.
I hear you there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When will the Cardinals win a title?
I am not sure
They should have won it a few years ago
That was a great game
Yes it was
I forget who the other team was though
It was the Steeler
Oh, they are good.
They have a good coach
He has been there a long time
I like their defense
They have a strong defense and a good offensive line
I hope they play again in the Super Bowl
That would be cool
The NFC is tough this year though
I agree. The Cowboys are great
Do you think they can win it?
I think they can get to the finals
Then who will beat them?
The Patriots
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am in the mood for some football!
I know! Will the NFL ever return?
It seems like it has been gone for such a long time! We are getting close at least.
I am excited to start having my Detroit Lions watch parties again. You will have to come over this Fall!
I did not know you did that, I would love to come!
Yea we just grill out here at the house and watch the Lions play.
That sounds like a great time, count me in this year!
Awesome! Speaking of the Lions, what kind of team do you think we will have?
My hopes are high! I am pretty excited about where we are right now.
Being a Lions fan has been painful over the years, so I am keeping my hopes in check.
I can understand that; although I think we finally have the parts to make a decent run.
I love Matthew Stafford and some of our other pieces. I am just hoping they come together the right way.
I think Jim Caldwell knows what he is doing, so I am confident.
I feel like in order for us to really become a contender, we have to get better on defense.
I agree with you there. We can not simply be in the middle of the pack in every category and expect to make a run!
We need to get better at linebacker first and foremost!
I know, I am hopeful that rookie Jarrad Davis can be the answer there.
He will really have to play well in order for us to get back to the playoffs in my opinion.
Our depth has been an issue for quite some time!
I know, I wished the front office would really address that in the coming years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about the NFL East?
Ah! The best division in football!
Says you! In the 90's yeah, but not now my friend. Dak and Zeke in Dallas. What do you think they'll do this year?
Sophomore slump.
What!?! Your crazy man Dallas is going to repeat as East Champs!
I can't see it. You seen their schedule?  8-8
Whatever  man. Who you got in Second?
It's hard. I'm going to say NY Giants.
They are always hard for me to pick. They can go 7-9 or 13-3, and I never know what they will do!
Eli should be Eli again 30 td and 20 INT. But that's good enough for second and a playoff spot.
Then the Redskins ?
Yeah. Cousin has to prove he deserves that money.
I like him. I really do. I just aint convinced he's a leader.
Yeah, he tries.  But im saying they'll play 500 ball
And that's putting Philly in last.
I Like Carson Wentz, and there Coach too. I forget his name. Used to be Farves back up
Yeah, I know who youre talking about. They will be ready in 2018, but not yet.
All the division games in the East will be tight!
No doubt! Always are!
Yep, my final predictions are Dallas, NY, WSH, and Philly last.but all of them over 500. They are all going to be competitive this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I think is the dumbest way to use the running back is?
Oh, God Here we go. What?
Just letting run straight up the middle.
Um no that's one of the best ways
Oh God, no. They either run into the asses of the offensive line or get tackled by the D line
Only if the O line didn't block properly. If they block well, the RB can pop out from the back with all the momentum and run straight through
Yeah, well that never happens.
It happens all the time!
Anyway, who has the best rushing attacks this year?
Probably Falcons. Devonta Freeman, Tevion coleman,. Both beasts
Yeah I liek those two.
I also like Zeke with cowboys
zeke is a beast. You know who else is a beast?
Yes I do.. I know who esle is a beast rusher. Le'veon Bell.
Boom. Mic drop
Dude is a beast. You know what we need?
Yes, I do. I know what we need. We need to get Zeke, Devonta, and Le'Veon on the same team.
And just rotate them play after play.
Run their defenses down, play after play
And then boom a hole will pop open and my boys go running with da ball!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team.
I don't really have one I don't get into football
Well what state are you from
I'm from Indiana Why ?
Well that's the home of the Indianapolis Colts. You've never been to one of their games?
No. Except when I was a security officer, and saw a game at the Convention Center where I worked
Oh yeah, how long ago was that ?
About fifteen years.
Do you remember who their star quarterback was
I think it was Payton Manning
Do you remember who they played?
No it was a long time back so I wouldn't know
Well my favorite team is the Cowboys. Dallas Cowboys that is
Yeah alot of people like them
I dont really have a favorite player though
why not?
They all are really talented.
Well if you had to choose just one who would that be
Oh come on, dont make me choose. They are all too good
Well, just asking !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello
What's good
Just playing some fantasy sports
Having fun?
Sure am
What exactly do you do
Well right now I am building my team
Building?
Yeah constructing
How so
Well by creating the NFL team of my dreams
Ah
Yeah it's fun
Can you use any player on any team
Easily can
So I can put lions players with steelers
You can..
What?
I do not get why you would want to though
Why not
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL is getting close to kicking off another season!
I know, I am really excited about that!
I figured you would be. Which teams will you be following this year?
You know me, I follow the entire league!
A couple friends of mine from work were discussing the NFL the other day.
Really? What were they discussing about it?
They were having a debate about who the best cornerback of all time was.
I wish I could have been part of that discussion.
I thought about you when I heard them talking about it!
Who were they saying the best cornerbacks of all time were?
One of them said Darrell Green was the best he had ever seen.
I remember Green, he was fantastic as a corner.
The other one was sure that Champ Bailey was the best ever.
Bailey was great as well, I even followed him in college when he played for Georgia.
So who do you think it was? Bailey or Green?
Neither! Those two friends of yours must have been forgetting about someone who was really the best corner of all time.
They both seemed pretty sure of themselves. Who do you think they were forgetting?
The best corner of all time was hands down Deion Sanders!
I remember watching him myself! Did he have some type of nick name?
Yea, his nickname was Prime Time! He was the best to ever do it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
Is it that time of year already?
You know it!
I am getting sick of baseball.
I think it will be the best season ever!
I hope so.
You know, they had that last game. It took a 60 yard pass to beat them.
Don't remind me. Darn that Rogers!
It's my pet peeve; they lost containment.
Well, the guy in the back of the end zone was too deep too.
That ain't going to happen again.
Right.
Who knows? Anyway, the running backs are looking good.
Nobody cares about the running game. It's a passing league now.
Yeah, I liked it when there was a balanced game.
You mean in 1972 with the Bears?
You don't have to go back that far, dude!
Or I guess the Chargers were balanced with Dan Fouts.
Were you even alive back then?
Let's not forget the m
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's up?
It's not your team's win lose record, that's for sure.
Dude, why are you always hating on Manning?
It's not that I hate on Manning, it's just Brady is obviously much better.
You seriously can't acknowledge that 0-4 isn't the best the NFL's has seen in a long time.
I can acknowledge Brady can kill that record with very little effort.
What he could do and what he can do are two different things.
This is true, but 4-0 is really no big deal.
You say Manning's record is no big deal, but no one has beaten it.
It doesn't matter. Manning's 4-0 is still not worth bragging about.
Well, what has Brady done on the field?
What has Brady done? He's done multiple Super Bowls.
No, Brady's team has done multiple Super Bowls. What are Brady's acomplishments as a player?
That team would have never seen a single Super Bowl without Brady. That's his contribution.
Again, that's a team effort. Brady does not stand out of the pack.
Well, what good is Manning's accomplishments if they haven't helped his team get to the Super Bowl?
Ben, Brees, Romo, these guys would kill to play alongside Manning not Brady.
Fantasy football doesn't win Superbowls. Players would kill to get a ring.
What good is winning the Super Bowl if everybody's going to focus on poster boy Brady?
They'd still have their place in history as Super Bowl winners and not fade into the sunset like miserable Manning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
my eagles will have a rough go of it this season.
they have a rough go every season.
naw not really.
yeah, really. they shouldn't have gotten rid of chip kelly.
man chip kelly wasn't the savior.
dude, two winning seasons in three years. and y'all let him go.
i think he had a problem with the owners.
that's because he wanted to be coach and general manager. this ain't college.
chip kelly ain't n f l material.
exactly. but anyway, what does the eagles' schedule look like?
they got the chiefs, seattle, the rams, the raiders.
man, that does seem like a tough stretch. but y'all can beat the rams.
i know right. but then we still have the division foes.
well at least you know the giants and washington won't do much.
you never know. i never count the giants out.
yeah, eli manning is a beast.
somewhat. and i do think kirk cousins might have shot his load.
yeah. the skins was good like two seasons ago.
they won that division didn't they?
i think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Browns wll do this year
I like their draft picks,
I do too but they need to start them,
True, You know they are not going anywhere this year but the rookies need experience
I agree, Now to just see who will be quarterback
I just hope The Steelers do well
Me too but Ben is getting older
yeah and beat up all the time, The talent is there at least on offense
yeh, they have not lived up to the defenses of the past in Pittsburgh lately
I just hope the Patriot don't repeat
I don't like Brady
Me either, I am just tired of seeing them in the Super Bowl all the time
Me too, I also hate seeing the Cowboys and Greenbay every Sunday on TV
Me too, They get old, but I do like Prescott
I hope Prescott does well, He was impressive as a rooking
I want to see what Atlanta can do, Hope they can match the success they had last year.
I still root for Seattle and Minnesota, Always something about those teams
I'm like that with Arizona.
Just hiope the season isn't lame, The game isn't like it used to be
No it's not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up man, you see the new Sports Illustrated?
Nah I didn't, who is on the cover?
Odell Beckham is getting crazy attention, I was actually just watching his highlights.
Oh man he was a beast, still is.
The injuries mostly got to him, but you remember that backwards catch?
Who doesn't bro?
That was a lifechanging moment, sealed him as an all time great!
An all time great off one catch and a single play?
Sometimes that is all it takes, that is in addition to the thousands of plays he's clutched!
He was on of the fastest dudes in the league, I loved his feints and fakes too.
I just see New York as a place where players and teams go to die.
That is the west coast in you brother!
It may be a bias, but still, most of the East just doesn't cut it.
The Patriots are incredible but I must agree.
The Giants and the Jets need a massive overhaul in coaching and management.
They definitely aren't who they were in the 80s.
As long as the West prevails, that is what I care about!
I can appreciate all teams as long as we get good games.
I remember only seeing you with Cardinals and west coast team jerseys.
Hey, I am an equal opportunity fan!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The culture surround the NFL just keeps growing. It's got to be worth millions.
I know. Things used to be so simple, not there are tons of replays in high def!
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Do you know how many teams there are these days?
I think there are 32 teams, with an average team value of $1 billion.
Holy cow! I didn't realize they were that valuable!
Well, if you think the average game attendance for an NFL game is 66,957 spectators...
After the tickets, add in the beer, food, and souvenirs. Yeah, I can see that.
Did you know there are nearly 3 million sports industry jobs in the U.S, that's approximately 1% of the population.
I never thought of it that way. Not to mention all the commerce that is indirectly related.
Yeah, According to the California Avocado Commission, 12 million pounds of avocados will be purchased in the week leading up to the Super Bowl.
Wow, that's a lot of guac! I love that stuff!
You and every other American on Super Bowl Sunday! That's like 8 million pounds of guacamole!
I love the food that is associated with football! All that yumminess that goes so well with beer!
Guess what the most popular foods are?
Pizza has to be in there!
Wings and pizza are the most popular Super Bowl snacks.
I get that and a few other goodies, then kick back and watch the big boys play!
Hey that's why it's football is the best sport around.
Yeah, just like “G” on the Green Bay Packers helmet doesn’t stand for Green Bay, but rather, it stands for “Greatness.”
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about football
Great i love it
Me too
I used to play
I bet it was fun
So much fun
I always wanted to but never did
It was so great being part of a team
I bet it was a great experience
It was, i always wanted to play for the Cowboys
Are they your favorite team?
Yes they are
They are alright
Who do you like
Green bay packers
They are pretty good
Ive always loved them
Does your family like them?
No just me
Oh okay
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how is your team gearing up for the new NFL season?
Well, you know I am a Patriots fan, right?
I do. How do you think they are going to do.
Easy, they are going to repeat! No question in my mind.
Well that is pretty confident when we have a whole season to play.
It is, but I think that will the personnel and coaches we have it should be in the bag.
I don't know that I would be so confident. There are some other teams that look pretty good this year.
There are, but are there any that can match up to the Patriots?
I think that the Cowboys have a good shot this year.
Really? I mean, I know they have potential to be good, but I don't think they will be the best.
I think that they are going to suprise people and be in the hunt at the end of the season.
Why are you so sure of that?
Same reason as you. They have good personnel and coaches.
I guess we will have to see how it shakes out. Dak Prescott is pretty good, I will give you that.
I saw something saying the top three teams likely to play in the Super Bowl are the Patriots, the Packers, and the Cowboys.
I would love to see any of them, as long as the Pats are there.
We will see, I feel like this season will be full of suprises.
I could see that.
I would love to see my Chiefs sneak up on people.
They have a chance. They had a decent year last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football???
Yes, I am so ready.
I know what you mean, summer drags on.
I agree so ready for football season and the fall to get here.
Who do you think will be the surprise team this year?
I am not sure, but we know there always is that one team that surprises.
I agree.  I am going to go out and say the Browns will make the playoffs!
Really?  No way I can't believe that.
Why not, it would be great if the go from worst to first.
Okay, but I still don't see them doing very well.
Well, we shall see but I called it first.  Browns in the playoffs!
Yeah sure whatever.
Okay, so who is your surprise team then?
I think the Tennessee Titans will surprise and make the playoffs
Well I guess you could be right. They do appear to be on the rise.
Yes, I think they are with Mariotta and all coming into his prime a bit.
Yes, I forgot about him, I agree they might just make the playoffs.
Actually I think they will go so far as to make the AFC championship at least.
Really?  I can't see that at all.
Okay, well we will see.  At least a better choice then the Browns you chose!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cowboys offensive line is incredible.
Well, they are pretty good.
Pretty good?  They're like the Golden State Warriors of OL's.
When you spend high picks on them all, of course they are going to be.
Yeah, but they weren't all that high.
They were all first rounders.
Yeah, but we're not talking all top ten picks here.
I think Tyron Smith was.
He was, but Martin was in the teens I think.
That's really high for a guard.
And Frederick was a first rounder.
At the end of the first round I think.
Yeah, and if you remember, everyone hated the pick.
It was an odd pick.
Just because they thought he was overdrafted by a round or two.
It was a steep price for a center.
Steep price?  He's a perennial Pro Bowler.
No, I get that, just saying it was still a first round pick they had to burn.
In any event, you can't deny that they are a talented group.
We'll see how they do without Leary and Free this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what you think about the Saints this year?
It'll be interesting, they still don't have the defense they need though.
Yeah Rob Ryan really screwed us over!
Yeah they're defense has been terrible.
Are you excited about having Adrian Peterson though?
No not really.  The guy is old, and history shows age is not friendly to running backs.
Yeah but he came back from the ACL so strong a few years ago, I'll bet he has a lot left in the tank.
I don't know man, watching him play the last two years, he looks so much slower.
Maybe if he just loses some weight?
Maybe, but he's never been a really elusive runner, he's more of a power guy.
Yeah I guess you're right.
We still have Mark Ingram though, and he's proven to be pretty good.
Yeah, it's a real shame we lost Brandon Cook though.
Yeah he was a real weapon, it's gonna be tough to watch him play for the Patriots this year.
Yeah, you just know Belichek is going to use him the best way possible.
Oh for sure, he's gonna put up number like Welker did.
Right, I think he's better than Welker was.
He might be, definitely has the measurables to be better.
Yeah, Welker was just good at beating zones and matchups.
He was quick, but Cook is quick too, just with better top end speed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you looking forward to football this fall?
Oh, yeah for sure. It is definitely one of my favorite times of the year. Any picks for who is going to do well this year?
Well, I think the Steelers will be good. And probably the Patriots again. They just seem kind of unstoppable.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Tom Brady is just amazingly good, even though he is getting older.
Yeah, it just seems that you can put any players around him and he can produce big plays and wins.
I think you're right, for sure. I don't know if I am sold on the Steelers though.
How come? I thought you were a big Pittsburgh fan. Plus, they always seem to do pretty well.
Oh no, I still am. And I want them to do well. It's just that for the first time in awhile, I think their shortcomings are really starting to show.
Really? Like where? It seems in some ways, all they can do is go up.
I'm not as sure about that as I once was. I think Big Ben isn't what he used to be, and is really starting to show his age.
Well, I guess I don't totally disagree with that. But, I mean he still produces pretty well, and the Steelers do have some younger talent that is pretty impressive.
Oh, no, you're right about that. It's just that they have always been a real "leadership-needy" kind of team to me, and if a lot of that leadership comes from Ben, and he is starting to slow down, that could not be good news.
Ok, I see your point there. I guess we will have to just wait and see if it actually is a problem on the field.
Yeah, I think you're right. But besides the Steelers, I am pretty excited about Texas football this season; I think the Cowboys and the Texans can both be good.
Really? I wouldn't have pegged them as frontrunners.
I just think they are the kind of teams that can be surprising; you can never tell what they are going to do.
I am with you there. They just seem to have either really good or bad seasons; nothing in the middle.
For sure. I just have a feeling that they could both be on the rise this season.
I know what you mean. I guess we just have to wait and see. It looks like it is going to be a good season no matter what!
Oh yeah! I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Marshawn Lynch have a good season with the Raiders?
Yes, he's super motivated
Don't you worry about him being rusty after retirement?
No. Marshawn Lynch is in great shape.
The Seahawks will never find another like Marshawn Lynch.
Agree, they really miss him
Still, I think the Seahawks will make the playoffs
I don't. Pete Carroll had his good run.
Maybe, but new guys will still respond to his unique ways
Yeah, Always compete!
Will Russell Wilson have a good year?
Yes, he has lost weight and is healthy
He played hurt last year
I hope his offensive line protects better
Agree. That was a real problem last year
It's gotta get better
Can't get any worse, it was awful
Will the Seahawks new kicker succeed?
Blair Walsh?
Yes, he was a Minnesota Viking before
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think has the worst personality in the NFL?
As far as players go, it's a toss up between Aqib Talib and Richard Sherman
Is it something about playing defense that makes people so unpleasant?
I know people gave Ndamukong Suh a hard time for being a dirty player, but at least he wasn't running his mouth off
I hear bad things about Vontaze Burfict on the Bengals, too
Do you know of any dirty offensive players?
I don't know about dirty, but Odell Beckham Jr. has a pretty bad attitude and doesn't deal well with loss
Well when you play for the Giants, you ought to learn to deal with loss
Steve Smith Sr. had an attitude, I know, but he's retired now so I suppose that doesn't count
Yeah, and he really showed up Talib when he played for the Panthers
That guy had it coming, playing aggressively and taking cheap shots and players
You'd think he would have learned his lesson by now, but there he goes poking guys in the eye
Yeah what was that about?
And then he ripped Michael Crabtree's chain off his neck during a game
To be fair, there's no reason to be wearing flashy jewelry during an NFL game
Maybe not, but that doesn't give other people the right to destroy others' property
I saw a guy get some of his dreadlocks ripped off during a game once
I remember that, and I remember the referees basically saying that players' hair is an extension of their uniform and that grabbing it isn't a penalty
Maybe Aqib Talib is bald because he's afraid his behavior will make people want to rip his hair out
That, or maybe being a dirty player makes your hair all fall out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Marshawn Lynch is back!
Yeah, he's going beast mode for the Raiders now.
How do the Falcons comeback after chocking in the Superbowl?
Most teams don't but its going to have to start with Matt Ryan.
The Patriots are going to be even more deadly when Rob Gronkowski comes back.
They are so favor to win it again. It's insane.
I'm telling you, the Dallas Cowboys are going to the Superbowl this year.
It's the Cowboys. Something always happens and they miss it.
In other news, our LA Rams are preparing for another bad season.
Don't remind me. I was so excited when they first moved here.
The Giants are the team to beat in the NFC East.
It's all going to come down to Eli Manning and not throwing interceptions.
Who's the best quarterback in the game right now?
Hard question but its between Aarron Rodgers and Tom Brady right now.
Cam Newton has alot to prove to his team this season.
The pressure is definitely on because they've just had disappointment after disappointment.
Just heard this might be Richard Sherman's last year with the Seahawks.
Wow. What do they have left other than Russel Wilson if he leaves?
Joe Flacco is going to have to do all by himself this season.
How can he if he has no good receivers? The team needs help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won the MVP for the NFL this year ?
I think Matt Ryan, that quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons won last year
He is their star player, no doubt.
They could not have chosen a better player Matt Ryan is the tops
He was competing with Tom Brady
Who does Tom Brady play for?
New England Patriots
Who has the best stats
Matt Ryan obviously with almost 5,000 rushing yards
Very valuable to his team !
What about Tom Brady, what are his stats?
Well he had more than 3500 rushing yards
So Matty 'Ice' was obviously the best choice
Yes but both are pretty good!
Who do you think will win next year
That remains to be seen
Im thinking Drew Brees, possibley even Christian McCaffrey
Ah Drew Brees. I forgot about him but he is a great player for his team
They all are great players
Yeah I guess we will  just have to wait and see
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm glued to this interview.
Who is the player?
Eddie Smith.
I love Eddie!
He's a tank.
I concur.  What'd he say?
Talked about his childhood and college years in football.
Is he from Johnston, Ohio?
Yes he is!
My cousin is from there.
Oh, they might know him.
They went to school with him.
Really though?
They were friends.
I wonder if they still talk.
They lost touch, but are FB friends.
He's talking about his wife now.
It's getting juicy.
Not yet.
Keep listening!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Kansas City Chiefs are a good team.
They started 57 years ago.
Yes, they started in 1970.
They are a AFC West team since 1970.
Their uniform is red and white.
It has a bit of gold on it.
Their mascot is K.C. Wolf.
The Hunt Family own the team.
Their general manager position is currently vacant.
They used to be called the DALLAS TEXANS.
They have 19 playoff appearances.
They had 6 playoff appearances in a row.
They first were based in Dallas.
The team is valued at just under $1 billion.
They have won 3 AFC championships.
In the beginning the owner wanted to by the CHICAGO CARDINALS.
He wanted to move them to Dallas.
He wanted to start a team in Dallas.
But he was denied.
So he started the AMERICAN FOOTBALL LEAUGE
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the lions will make the playoffs this year.?
I think they have a shot.
I'm reading a lot of 6-10 predictions.
I think with some breaks they could make a playoff run.
They would need breaks.
I like Mathew Stafford.
I think he has a good future.
They helped the offensive line.
They picked up Tj Lang and tackle Ricky Wagner.
Some have Ameer Abdullah having a breakout season.
I think they will score points.
Stafford is a smart quarterback.
His game management skills are real good.
Yes they are.
I think he'll have more time to throw the ball this year.
Yes,with the additions on the line,I agree.
I think they make the playoffs.
I think they do too.
In fact,I think they win a playoff game.
You could be right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Smallwood is going make a difference this year for the Eagles.
He is definitely I would agree.
He is confident and learned a lot this year.
Spring training has helped prepare the Eagles for a tough season.
I think they could go all the way.
I hope they do.
What year did the Eagles last make the Super Bowl?
They were there in 2005.
Wow, that's a long time ago.
They only made it twice to the Super Bowl.
I still think this is their year.
What makes a team able to get to the Super Bowl?
I think determination.
They have to have a lot of skill and talent as well.
It only takes one great year.
That's true, it could happen this year.
What team made the Super Bowl the most?
The Patriots and Steelers have made it a lot.
They do tend to seem to be winners a lot.
I'm excited for the season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What teams will have the strongest defenses in 2017 in the NFL?
I think the Bengals will stay stout, and the Patriots will be strong. You?
I think that the Dolphins will actually have a great defensive year.
Yes, they need Wake to come back strong.
I agree, his injury last year was unfortunate.
Those type of injuries always are - any type of tear.
I agree - what do you think about the Steelers?
They have always had great defenses, and hopefully will have another great one.
We will see. I'm not so sold this year.
Why do you say that?
Well they have been stagnant for a bit and no longer have their older greats.
Troy Polamalu was a stud.
Yes, him and James Harrison used to be great.
Harrison has always been a mad man.
I think that the Seahawks will have another great season.
I forgot about them - their defense is always amazing.
Yes, I agree. They have great defensive talent every year.
Yes, and their coaching staff is top notch.
I agree with this assessment.
We will see this year who has the best defense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey man
I am lost on something
Lost on what
Trying to understand something
What's that
What a NFL fantasy league is
What about one
Well I want to set one up
Yeah?
Sounds like my thing
What can you not get?
Well actually doing it
Whatcha mean
I am not good with computers
Oh I get you
Yeah
Want me to help
Would be swell thanks
No prob man
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Drew Brees finally going to have a bad year?
No I don't think that he will ever have a bad statistical season.
The Saints aren't that good of a team anymore.
Well no, but Brees still puts up gaudy numbers from the quarterback position.
Do you think that he will ever reach the Super Bowl again?
No, not with this team.
So you see him going to another franchise for the last couple years of his career?
Maybe, but he's already late-thirties in age.
What about Sean Payton and his prospects for another Super Bowl?
He'll probably get back there again.
I think Coach Payton is a genius when it comes to offense.
Yes, he was really effective when his offense was fresh and new.
So you think defenses have caught onto his offensive scheme?
Yes, but I won't rule him out if he adapts his playbook a little bit.
I guess Payton still has a long time to go in his career.
That's the great thing about being a coach, because you can continue into your seventies if you want.
Yeah, as a player you only have about fifteen playing years to accomplish everything.
Do you think that Brees will go into coaching when his playing days are over?
He could, because he seems to get the cerebral part of the game.
Yes, quarterbacks usually make the best coaches because of their understanding of playbooks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, the NFL season is coming up.
Yeah. I am aware. I'm really excited. How about you?
Of course. I am going to be rooting for my favorite team!
What is your favorite team by the way?
My favorite team is the Washington Redskins.
Oh ok.
What's the problem?
Well the Redskins haven't made any advancement from the playoffs to the Super Bowl since the late 90s.
I understand that but I always love a great defensive team. What is your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowboys.
I heard their new stadium is really massive and great for hosting the Super Bowl.
Of course. As long as Tony Romo doesn't get any injuries this year it's all in the bag.
The game isn't won on soley defense. Besides, Romo is getting old don't you think?
This is coming from a Redskins fan? You lost RGIII. Please don't give me a lecture.
Realistically, Romo probably has another season left in him and then he is out.
We will see. How about your draft picks?
What about the draft picks? I'm confident in the choices they made.
I never really am. They just don't listen to the teams and take in consideration for things.
Things such as what?
Salary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the whole cte stuff.
Its scary for anyone
You dont mess with concussions
I know Ive had a couple
Really
Yup
Not as bad as players though.
Brain trauma is the worst
and how the nfl covered it up is worse
i know right
if some of these players had gotten help
maybe they would be alive
to many good players taking their lifes
at least now they're studying it more
and its not a secret anymore
It's a shame that these older players went through what they did and made nowhere near the money that players do now
At least they can help now
Hopefully
People know what to look for
that is true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know where they are gonna have next super bowl at?
I have no clue. Not like my team is gonna be there...
Who's your team?
Miami dolphins. They aren't so hot.
They aren't that bad either. Besides things can change with the draft...
Yeah, I know, but they haven't been good for some years now.
Well, I'm still a Giants fan and I really am rooting for them.
You know, they may have a chance though.
I hope so. Another team I like is the Titans. I used to live in Nashville.
Oh, they surprised us last season! They were good!
Yeah, I love it when a young team like that do so well.
I know, they are kind of an under dog.
Mariota is pretty impressive.
Is he recovered from his leg injury?
Oh, I forgot about that. I would think so. He had a lot of time to recover...
...and he is young and healthy.
Exactly. I have high hopes for them.
Better than the Dolphins? haha...
Better than the Browns, Duh!
That's mean! Hahaha, but so true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, football season is close, are you excited?
Absolutely! Who-Dey Baby! I am all in this season to see Andy Dalton lead the Bengals to the playoffs
How do you feel about their draft class this year? Were you impressed with who they picked up?
I think Ross and Mixon will be great additions to the offense. I also like Ellis, the Linebacker from Kansas State
This is a contract year for Marvin Lewis, do you think he will be back after this year?
Who knows? Mike Brown seems to really like him, even though the Bengals haven't won a playoff game with him as coach
Right, I am not sure either. He is an okay coach, I also know that Mike Brown seems to really like him. I do feel that we need a coach that can us to the next level.
I would love to have an old school Bengal like Max Montoya or Kenny Anderson as head coach. Someone who fans know and love.
My favorite games are the divisional games, the ones with the Steelers, Browns or Raven.
Those are my favorite games too. Those games are the most important ones, they almost count as two games.
Do you know when the Steelers come to town? We should go to that game.
The Steelers come to town on December 4th. That game is even on ESPN
Sounds like a plan, we should totally go. I will buy the tickets and you can pay me back.
Thanks man, I am looking forward to it. My brother is a big Colts fan, and the Colts come to town on October 29th, would you want to go with us?
That sounds like a great time. Games before Halloween are a lot of fun. People dress up, and have a good time.
In the 90s we went to games with bags on our heads, when it wasnt even the Halloween game.
The Browns are in town on November 26th, would you like to go to that game?
I can't, we are going out of town to see family. Otherwise I would. I am sure that is a game the Bengals can win.
Sounds great man. I am excited about this upcoming season
Me too, We will have a lot of fun at these games. Talk to you later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I don't care for it much
Oh, why not?
It's just not my style
But it's so fun!
See I get bored
Oh, thats too bad
Yea, the best part is probably the tailgating
tailgating is fun
We can agree on that!
Indeed
I sometimes go to cheap games just to tailgate
Oh?
Yea we just drink through the entire game
It seems fun!
It is!  You should try it sometime!
I think I might!
Yea just score some cheap tickets!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the Ravens' chances this season?
I hope they do better than last year but I don't know if the offense will be good enough.
Yeah, losing Steve Smith was tough.
Definitely! Perriman is unproven and Wallace has had a good season before only to tail off the next year.
I'm personally hoping they'll sign Gary Barnidge.
I am too. He's not the greatest tight end but he's decent.
I'd also like to see them sign Nick Mangold. We need a center.
Yes we do. I don't understand why nobody has signed him yet.
Me either. How do you think Flacco will play this year?
Hopefully good...he needs to elevate the players around him.
USA Today just listed him as the most overpaid player in the NFL.
I don't agree with that. He's overpaid, but so are most quarterbacks.
If he would just be postseason Joe all season long!
Absolutely, he's a beast in the playoffs!
How about the defense? Will they be feared again?
I sure hope so..that's what we've always been known for, defense. They need to play better in the secondary though.
They do...but I think Tony Jefferson was a big signing.
He definitely was. Hopefully he and Weddle will lock it down this year.
Let's hope so...GO RAVENS!
Absolutely man, we'll find out in a few months!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the MVP award this year?
Derek Carr will probably win it based on how much they missed him last year and how much hell improve this year.
Do you think the Patriots will win it again?
I dont think so.  I think they might be on the decline as the divsion gets better and they get older.
Will the Titans make the playoffs this year?
I think they could get in the wildcard.
Do you think Adrian Peterson will be effective in New Orleans
I think he will improve their offense but not enough to make a playoff run.
Who do you think will win the NFC North?
Im guessing the Packers will but if the Vikings can get better and be more consistent I could see them making a run for it
Will the Browns be any good this year?
They have a lot of good pieces but i dont know if they can get more than 4 wins this year.
Will the dolphins be able to upset the Patriots this year?
They could outscore them with their offensive skilled players but im not sure the defense can stop tom brady
Do you think the Bengals will make the playoffs?
No I think theyre about to be in a long drought without making the playoffs.
How many games do you plan on watching?
I plan on watching all the Vikings games but after that Im not too sure.
Will Dak Prescott improve his game this year?
I think he will get better but the competition will be much better so Im not sure his stats will improve much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a replay of the first Superbowl last night.
Wasn't it not called the Superbowl?
Right, it was called a World Championship game.
Who played?
The Kansas City Chiefs versus the Green Bay Packers.
Cool.  Was it televised?
Yes, on two networks!
Why was that?
NBC had the AFL rights and CBS had the NFL rights.
Who scored first?
Green Bay, 7-0, first quarter.
What happened in the second quarter?
Kansas City tied it, but Green Bay scored another touchdown before KC had a field goal.
How was the halftime show?
Not bad.  Al Hirt and two college marching bands.
What happened next?
The Packers scored 14 in the third and 7 in the final quarter.
KC?
They never scored again.
A victory for the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who do think has one the most championship titles in the NFL?
Oh, that's easy. The Green Bay Packers.
Really, the Packers?
Yeah, they have 13 championships. They are the winningest team in all the NFL.
Really, 13? That's a lot but I thought San Francisco had more.
No that is a common mistake that everyone makes, but they are not even in the top 5!
Really? How many championships have they won?
Only 5. They won all their in the early 80's and 90's.
Was that when they had Joe Montana and Steve Young?
Yeah and don't forget Jerry Rice. He's the greatest receiver of all time!
Yeah, he was an awesome player. With those 2 quarterbacks, he was unstoppable.
I know, right?
A lot of people think the New England Patriots are up there too, but they're not.
Yeah, I'm one of them. I thought that.
They've only got 5 titles since last year.
Who has more titles than 5?
Believe it or not, the Cleveland Browns have 8 and so do the New York Giants.
Oh yeah, what about the Chicago Bears for the 80's?
Yeah, they are the second winningest team with 9 championships.
Wow, and Green Bay has 13? They are the best team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm back.  Whose in the lead?
The Indians!
Oh snap.
Who you going for?
The Alphas.
They're 3 points behind.
We can catch up!
If the Indians slow down.
Our best guy is out there!
Who?
Matthew Comp.
Yeah, he's good.
How about great?
Not that great!
The Alphas need 2 good touchdowns to take the Indians.
True, but unlikely.
Why is that?
Kemp Taylor is out on injury.
Oooh. Not good.
His replacement sucks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's hard to believe football season is coming up again
It really is!
Are you playing in a fantasy football league this year?
I hope so; it's usually fun.
I haven't decided to play or not yet.
I think it makes the NFL season more fun.
Me too. I like to feel invested in the games.
Do you think the broncos will be any good this year?
It hasn't been as much fun since manning retired.
I know, it was really fun to watch at home him play
I'm also rooting for the patriots this year.
I think they win too much as it is.
It's hard to deny that they are a good team.
Right but Brady doesn't seem as likable since deflate gate.
In a way, it doesn't matter. He's good at football.
I get it. I don't disagree.
I am curious about the browns this year.
I always wonder when they will be better.
I feel bad for them sometimes.
Maybe this will be their year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch some NFL this weekend?
Sure, I usually do anyway.
What game are you going to watch?
I'm not sure yet, do you have a preference?
Not really just some good smash mouth games.
I love those games.
Me too that's why I watch.
I think any of them will be good.
Do you think there will be any new teams added to the league soon?
I don't think soon.
What about in the next fifteen years?
I think so a few new teams will be added.
Think they will ever do a female NFL league?
I hope so but it's doubtful.
Yeah, I don't think the public would like it much.
Yeah, publicity could be a concern.
Who do you think will win the superbowl?
Indianapolis Colts.
That's surprising why?
Andrew Luck is going to explode.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to the stadium in Arizona where the Cardinals play?
Yeah, many times. It was only 10 minutes away from where we used to live.
I was wondering if it gets really loud because the roof is closed.
I guess so...then again any football game can get loud.
Where do they train before the season? In Arizona?
Yeah, the Cardinals training facility is in Flagstaff. It's in northern Arizona. Much cooler there.
Did you ever get to see the players up there? Like Larry Fitzgerald?
Yeah, I saw him and Kurt Warner back when he used to play.
Oh, he was a terrific player. Didn't he play for the Rams?
I think so. He is a great guy, too. So is Larry Fitzgerald.
Do you think they have a shot this season?
There's no reason not..but I say that every year. It is a great team.
I feel that way with the Titans. too.
I agree, they are good team. They are kind of an underdog team. I want to see them do good.
They had a really good season last year. With Mariota coming back after the injury, I think they will surprise us all again.
It will be nice to see some other teams go to the Superbowl besides Pats and whoever...
I know, right? I don't want to see them or the Steelers.
I agree. I'm not big on the Packers either.
Maybe even the Browns will do better this year.
How can they do any worse? They had the worst season ever last year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team in the NFL would you like to see go see
I guess the Falcons
The Atlanta Falcons huh?
Yeah. They are pretty good to watch!
I used to live in Atlanta, but never went to see a Pro game
I lived there too but I never did see them at the stadium just on t.v.
They streets are always so crowded when they play in town
I know and theres no where to park downtown
Yeah the games really attract people from most everywhere
I know I once saw someone with Arizona license plates parked at the stadium game night
Wow that was a long drive
A really serious fan
Didnt they go to the Superbowl last year or was it year before last
It was fairly recent
I don't think they won though
They dont win every single time but they are a good team
They are one of my favorites too
We ought to go see a game next year
Yeah lets plan on it.
Its gonna be a long drive....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
I am excited, it's less than a month away.
That's for the pre-season, almost two months before the actual season starts.
I like the pre-season just as much as the regular season.
I don't usually follow the games until the season starts.
I watch as much as I can, I wish the seasons were longer.
So who is going to make it to the Super Bowl this year?
I think it will be the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys.
That would be a great game, they both did real good last year.
I was hoping it would be those teams in last years Super Bowl, but it just didn't happen.
I would like to see that happen also, the Steelers are the team I would want to win.
I think it will happen, and the Cowboys will win the game.
I have been a Steelers fan ever since Terry Bradshaw played for them.
Terry Bradshaw was a great quarterback.
Some people think that he was the best quarterback of all time.
He was definitely one of the greatest, if not the greatest.
I wonder if he thinks that he was the greatest quarterback of all time.
I don't know, but I sure enjoy watching him co-hosting on Fox.
I like watching him too. He does like the Steelers.
He better like the Steeler, they are the team that made him famous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so ready for NFL season!
I will be glued to my TV on Thursday, September 7th.
Oh yes, the Patriots and the Chiefs are playing the first game.
What teams are playing the second game of the season?
The Jets and the Bills have the first game on Sunday, September 10th.
Oh yeah, but the Eagles and the Redskins are playing at the same time on a different network.
I didn't realize the games were at the same time.
I guess I need to have two TVs up and running that day.
Yes, I have the NFL package, so I get to watch all the games.
Can I come over for some of the late afternoon games on Sunday?
Sure, Colts and Rams are on at 4:05 that day.
Sounds good. Seahawks and Packers will start shortly after.
Panthers and 49ers are at the same time.
Don't forget Sunday Night Football that night!
Oh yeah, Giants and Cowboys will be a great game.
My brother is a huge Dak Prescot fan.
I bet he'll have a great year.
Probably so. What time do you think that game will end?
It starts at 8:30. It probably won't end until close to midnight.
Maybe I better plan on spending the night at your house.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which two teams do you want to make it to the SuperBowl this year?
I really want to see the Patriots and Seahawks rematch.
I don't know man, it wouldn't even be the same.
What? why not?
Because Beast Mode isn't on the team anymore.
That's true, but they both still have a lot of the same players.
Yeah I guess so.
I just wouldn't want it to be a close game this time.
Who would you want to win?
I would really love for the Seahawks to win.
I just feel like, I want to mix it up, I don't want the Patriots to even make the Playoffs.
Is that to mix things up? Or just because you don't like them?
Hmm.. Why can't it be both?
The Patriots are a good team though.
Talent wise, I guess. I'm just really sick of them.
I don't know if you will get what you want this year.
Maybe not, but I can always hope.
Maybe they will make the playoffs, but lose early.
That would work for me I guess.
Keep your fingers crossed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you gamble on the NFL?
Yeah but it can be tricky.
How can I use the weather information to make better totals bets?
By getting early information. You’ll see adjustments to our lines once information comes out, but you still need to be careful; lousy weather doesn’t always = under. We’ve been burned by that misconception more than a few times
On analysis, is it better to put less weight on the passing & put more on rushing & defensive discipline?
Interesting question. I believe you need to incorporate both…it’s still a passing league and teams are shifting away from run-heavy offenses. Need to put equal weight on all phases of the game and find the strength of each team
Will there be fixed wagering limits on NFL in-play markets?
We have limits on live betting and will adhere to them at a minimum. However, we may at certain times increase limits for marquee games or as we see fit for certain games.
With the Seahawks record at (home field) CenturyLink, how does HFA factor into lines compared to the rest of the league?
Like any game, HFA is taken into account and incorporated into the line. As it’s week 1 and fresh off a Superbowl victory, Seattle, which is historically tough at home, will be extra raucous. That’s also taken into account when setting the line.
Do you expect lines to move a lot more early in the season until more info on teams comes in?
Absolutely. We need time like anyone else to figure out which surprises are legit. That means the lines aren’t as stable as they would be later in the season. Same is true of any sport.
Do you think that provides more value for bettors or more concerns?
it can be more value for those that take the time to evaluate and analyze, but it can also be concerning for those taking shots in the dark or making assumptions
How much does a team’s popularity factor into markets? Enough to move handicaps?
That’s tricky. Teams in high-population markets with good teams can move the markets, but our clientele is sharper than the average sportsbook’s, so our lines won’t move as much in that way.
Which teams get the biggest bumps that way?
It’s what you’d expect. Teams that make the Superbowl, that have national brands, that are fun to watch. It depends on he spread though…if you have the Broncos as a 14-point favourite, our clientele know there may be value on the dog because of the inflated line.
How does stronger enforcement of pass interference/illegal contact impact week 1 lines?
That’s a good question…hadn’t really considered it. I don’t think it affects the spread much because it’s a two-way game, but you may see an increase in the total points scored per game. We’ll watch that through the season and see if it has an effect, and whether it’s called as much as in pre-season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how do you think the Niners are going to do this year?
I think they are still rebuilding but I think they will have a stronger start then people expect.
Yeah, I agree. Shannanhan is going to see a lot of success quickly.
I think he has a chip on his shoulder because of how the Super Bowl ended.
Yeah, he has something to prove.
How many wins do you think they are going to get?
Nine, I think.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised of they got second in the division.
Me too, though I think we might be overly optimistic.
Probably, but you gotta hope right?
yeah, who do you think is going to take it all this year?
I'm getting the feeling that a team is going to come out of nowhere and surprise everyone this year.
Oh yeah? Any Ideas on who?
Not entirely sure. Maybe someone like the Dolphins or something.
I could see something like that happening.
Yeah, them or the Titians are my best guess.
Where are you going to watch the games?
I'm getting Sunday Ticket this year. You should come by.
Sounds good. Will do.
Great, I'll give you a call when the games start up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that game between the Panthers and Seahawks?
No, did the Panthers win the game.
Not even close. They got blown out.
Really, what was the score?
Seahawks had 40 to the Panthers 7.
I didn't know that. How did Cam Newton do?
He did okay. He threw for 182 passing yards.
How was the Panthers rushing?
They only had 89 yards as a team.
That's bad. How many rushing yards did the Seahawks have?
They dominated with 240 rushing yards.
So basically, the Seahwaks defense was able to shut down the run game for Carolina.
Yep, and Carolina was not able to stop the Seahawks rushing.
Who led the Seahawks in rushing?
The Seahawks were led by Thomas Rawis with 106 rush yards.
How many receiving yards did the Seahawks have?
As a team, the Seahawks had 315 receiving yards.
I see. The Seahawks basically dominated with the run game and the pass game.
Yes, Carolina did not have any answer for them either way.
Okay. I guess this is just a down year for the Carolina Panthers then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
You betcha! You who got this year? You're still not a Cowboys fan are you?
America's Team, baby! Their new offense is awesome. Romo had his moments, but he could never really deliver.
Yeah, well he's probably delivering pizzas now.  For me, the Packers are going to put it together his year.
The Packers? Their defense is a sieve.  They were ranked near the bottom of the league.
They're going to tighten that up this year, plus Aaron Rogers just keeps getting better, smarter, luckier.  I know they'll own the Cowboys.
Outside of the Packers, who do you think will win it all?
Well, the Cowboys will be last, but other than that, about twelve teams will end the season tied for the best record.
That's true. Parity has made the league almost unfun. You gotta gave some bad teams for everyone to beat up on.
Yeah, if you don't have some 2-14 records, you won't have any 14-2 records.  One year, I think the whole league will finish 8-8.
Well, that can't happen. Not with Cleveland.
Oh so, true. You totally have to try to be that bad. What are they doing there?
I'm pulling for a city, though. I don't particularly like either the Rams or Charges, but how about Los Angeles?
I know, right! No football for twenty something years, now two teams. And I think both could go to the playoffs. That's amazing. Exciting!
I think we agree on something! Los Angeles to the playoffs! Go Rams!
You mean, "Go Chargers!"  The Rams are still the hapless Rams.
It figures. Okay, crunch time. Pick a Super Bowl winner.
Packers. Team loyalty man. Of course, if we're putting money down, the Patriots.
Ohh, I hate the Patriots. I would rather give money away than bet ON the Patriots.
Well, at least you can celebrate six times this year when the Cowboys win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the NFL team the Colts?
Not really, i'm a Patriots fan.
They have a bit of a rivalry.
Used to when manning was still the quarterback.
Luck still brings the heat.
Yes, but the rivalry was between Manning and Brady.
That's a fair point.
Do you think Manning would have won if he was in Brady's position?
Hard to say really.
I think Brady would have still won he's the better all around Quarterback.
That's a fair opinion.
You don't agree?
I think it's hard to say, I think Brady had the better team.
I think Brady was the better player.
Peyton did amazing things with a subpar team.
That's fair.
Just imagine if both of their teams were good.
Those would have been some epic games.
Yes they would have been.
Now you have me wanting that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like the Seahawks?
Can't stand them.
Why?
They beat up on my Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII
Oh yeah, that's right. That was brutal.
Yeah, Broncos were thoroughly outplayed, but I couldn't stand watching them.
They have some good players though.
Yeah, Russell Wilson is a great QB.
Yeah, but they blew it in the Super Bowl the following year.
Oh yeah, that was really bad. Should've run the ball.
That's what everyone said.
I wonder if Pete Carroll is still having nightmares about that play?
Yeah, probably. Helped the Patriots win yet another Super Bowl.
I also can't stand Richard Sherman
Yeah, he has a pretty big mouth.
Did you know that he went to Stanford?
Really, I had no idea.
Yeah, it came out when he was in the Super Bowl.
Where's he from originally?
I think Compton, California.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the superbowl?
Yes i love it
Me too
It makes me a little sad because it means football season is coming to an end
Thats true
But its so excitinf
I agree
Everything about the superbowl is exciting
Even the commercials
Only the superbowl could make commercials exciting
Exactly
And my family always makes too much food
I know what you mean
Its pretty great though
I love all the food
And being around family and friends is great
Yes it is
I love the whole experience
I wish it happened more than once a year
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
let's not talk about injuries at QB, due to being hit a ton.
Want to see what OB can do with a good QB and decent to good OL play?
Watch NE when he was the OC.
They still run the same system, pretty much same as ours.
But, until the OL protection is good, you can be sure we won't see that type of play
Why would martim even be considered as a tackle? We drafted him to play on the interior of the o line, center to be exact... I don't get it
Mancz came in because Martin was hurt and did a fantastic job.
Just my opinion that Martin should be tried out at RT.
I'm with Malex on this one. I also think Martin will take over the center position......
Mancz will shift to RG.
I have no clue what we are doing at RT.
Yeah .... no kidding. Seems custom made for a Ramczyk type!
We can't honestly or accurately evaluate any of our QBs, RBs, WRs, or TEs until our offensive line is solidified.
that may never happen now that we've gone back to building our OL with 4th through 7th rounders.
I don't understand why you call TS mediocre. His problems have been physical, but when on the field, he has been very good.
I grew up watching the Cowboys and I like Tom Landry's attitude about players.
He said, "get me athletes and I'll make them football players." We need a little more of that and less GM wantabes at the HC position.
I think OB and Smith are not butting heads as much as most on this board think.
If Giacomini is healthy...then his veteran presence could be valuable at RT.
I would have him Davenport attached at the hip in all hopes that by the time the team hits the Bye Week, Davenport would be ready for heavy rotational duty.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite position in the NFL?
I think quarterbacks are overrated, but otherwise I kind of like receivers
Wide receivers only, or receivers in general?
I think in general, since a lot of positions receive passes pretty regularly
Some of my favorite plays are running backs receiving passes when no one expects it
Yeah, I remember a 49ers game several years back where Alex Smith passed to Frank Gore and he was wide open
Sometimes the smaller guys can slip through the cracks and make big plays
I think that's how Darren Sproles has been so successful over the years despite being below average size
Anyone under six feet is considered small in the NFL
Even Russell Wilson is called short, and yet it aids his elusiveness on the field
It's hard to think of someone so agile like that as just a quarterback
That's what makes me conflicted about quarterbacks, since in the past they've generally been more one-dimensional
Tight ends are another position that require versatility, since they both block and receive passes
Rob Gronkowski is a beast of a player as a tight end, and he's huge so blocking isn't much of an issue
The only downside is that his size makes him slower on the field
Slower, but not necessarily easier to stop when you see him dragging defenders several yards like they're nothing
Now I'd like to see more tight ends like that, although Travis Kelce and Martellus Bennett make a good case for themselves
Definitely, and so does Jason Witten, another guy who isn't super fast but who always knows how to get open
So the position isn't quite as important as defying expectations after all
Oh yes, hybrid players have been all the rage on defense, and I can't wait to see who surprises us next
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm ready for football season!
Me too, think the Bengals can do anything this year?
I hope so, it's been awhile.
Yea, Icky Shuffle days.
I love the Icky Shuffle!
Icky Woods was more entertaining than talented.
But he was fun!
Probably more talented than the guys we have now.
Dalton isn't bad.
If it hadn't been for the 49ers, we might have two Super Bowls to celebrate.
Hey, some teams have never even been!
This is true.
I wish Boomer Esiason could come back and lead this team.
Yea, we ain't had much success at quarterback.
At least the Browns give us chances at two victories.
Yea, but I'm sick of Pittsburgh rubbing our noses in their success.
I hope we beat them this year.
I don't like the Ravens either.
I don't think anyone outside of Baltimore does.
They are the stolen Browns franchise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the NFL this year?
I think the league is too stacked for certain teams
Which teams?
Mostly those in the AFC north
Who specifically? I can't think of any
The Patriots and Ravens obviously!
Oh I suppose about the Patriots but the Ravens aren't very good
They are too
Wait, aren't they your favorite team?
Maybe..
So you're a bit biased here?
Alright full disclosure, yes, I've been a Ravens fan for years
Well i guess that makes sense, they did win the superbowl recently
I was a Raven's fan long before they won the superbowl
Well then I guess that makes you a real fan
I hate it when people cheer for only the best teams in the league
Those are called bandwagon fans I believe
I hate those kind of fans
Oh well I hope your team does well, I don't particularly watch football
Thanks! I hope the Ravens end up winning the superbowl
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Lenny, did you get the birthday present I sent?
I did, I love it man!
I thought you would, did the jersey fit?
It fits perfectly, how did you know I was Dolphins fan?
My mom old me you loved Marino back in the day.
I really did man, I didn't know they still had his jersey.
They are hard to find, but he is a legend so it is possible.
We should watch some of his old games one day.
I would love that a lot, one of the best to ever do it.
A shame he never won the Superbowl to be honest.
That must have been upsetting to you as a big fan.
It is definitely one of the biggest what if situations I think about.
I have a few favorites that never made the Superbowl.
Like who?
McNair was a guy I liked, mostly quarterbacks.
It really makes you appreciate guys who can make it each year carrying the team on their back.
Are you trying to credit Tom Brady?
Maybe a little bit.
Fair enough but the Patriots are the old school Warriors team now.
I can see the correlation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's time to talk about those Atlanta Falcons.
I believe this is the year for them to bring home a trophy.
Another division and conference trophy yes?
No they are going to bring home a lombardi trophy to Atlanta,Georgia!
The Falcons do have NFL MVP Matt Ryan but they are playing in the most competitive division.
That they do, as well as picking up a pair of great linemen from free agency.
Yes, Dontari Poe will do wonders as tackle and not to mention Jack Crawford to fill the end position. Don't forget their draft pick ups.
Can not forget about the pair of linbackers, Takk McKinley and Duck Riley.
So you believe this will be the outcome to a NFL title?
I do see them becoming the new champions and bringing home the trophy to Georgia.
That will be one way to add some decoration to a brand new stadium.
Indeed, the Falcons will be in their new home, the Mercedes-Benz Stadium this season. Can't wait for their season opener!
That will be a game to watch, the rematch of last season NFC championship.
The Green Bay Packers are going to have their hands full.
I might have to disagree with you on this one I see the Packers winning by a touchdown.
No way, the Falcons take this easily by 14.
Well I guess we will just have to wait till game day and I can't wait for kick-off!
I agree, can not wait for the football season to get here!
NFC Championship rematch here we come!
I can not wait! Time to open the new stadium in a winning fashion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know less people are watching the NFL?
I am not sure how true that is.
Why do you say that?
A lot of people, myself included are watching via the internet and streaming methods.
Good point. The ratings might not factor that in.
The NFL is also growing in international popularity.
Good point. They are playing games in Europe now.
Don't forget the Canadian Football League.
Oh yes. A lot of former NFL players play in the CFL.
I am surprised Tim Tebow is not playing in the CFL.
He must not be that serious about playing in the NFL.
He is a talented guy. He will do well in baseball and broadcasting.
A lot of high profile college QBs flame out in the NFL.
Very true. Johnny Manziel, Colt McCoy, and Brady Quinn were some others.
Interesting. I think all of them played for the Browns.
The Browns have chewed up and spit out a lot of quarterbacks over the last 15 years.
They are finally focusing on building their defense up.
It will take time.
Everyone has to rebuild their teams every now and then.
The Browns have been rebuilding since the franchise restarted over twenty years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There seem to be some good young teams out there that could over take both soon.
Yea, who would you say?
I'm not sure. What do you think of Philly?
Eh, they have a quarterback hopefully, but they still have a ways to go.
Yea, I agree. They have some work.
Well, maybe Tennessee is further along.
Yea, they might be. They do have a couple pieces.
I agree! Also Dallas should be ready to take the next step.
Yea, I agree. Can't count out Atlanta either. They didn't exactly get worse.
No, they didn't they should be really good again this year.
Yea, Houston seems to be hanging on as well.
I do not know how they do it.
Well, they have an amazing defense, but eventually they have to get some play makers on offense.
Yea, their defense wins games, but they need a little more offense too.
Yea, maybe a quarterback that knows how to throw would be nice.
Yea, I agree. That would be a start.
Yea, well sometimes those are harder to find than you may think.
I agree. Hopefully they will find one sooner rather than later though.
Yea, hopefully. They sure could use one.
So could about ten other teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the Washington Redskins.
They are good.
Have you been to a Super Bowl.
No, but I would love to go.
They were established in 1932.
That's 85 years ago.
They play in FedExField.
That's in Maryland.
Their headquartered in Virginia.
Richmond to be exact.
They began in the EASTERN DIVISION.
In 1950 they joined the AMERICAN CONFERENCE.
Then they joined the EASTERN CONFERENCE.
Now they are part of the NFC east.
They have a cool uniform.
It can be various colors like burgundy, gold or white.
They have a fight song.
Hail to the Redskins.
Let's sing it.
I don't think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey question
Sure go ahead
You into sports
I like some
Cool cool
Why
Because wondering who your favorite team is
What sport
In football then
NCAA or NFL
NFL
The browns as lame as that is
What?!
Yeah
I am confused as to why
Because home team
But even then they are bad
Not all bad
Come on be realistic
I am
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a fan of the Cowboys in the 90s?
The football team?
Yeah, Dallas.
Oh, who wasn't?
Yeah, it seemed like everyone was a fan.
Even if you lived across the country you loved Dallas.
Yeah, they were like America's team.
That was back when Aikman was the quarterback, right.
Yeah, I remember Emmitt Smith was the running back then.
Oh, yeah.  Did you have one of those big jackets everyone wore?
One of the Starter jackets?
Yeah, they were popular then.
My brother had one of the Dallas Starter jackets.  It was blue with the big Dallas star on it.
Yeah, everyone had those.  You'd see a lot of Cowboy fans wearing them.
What does Troy Aikman do now?  I know I've seen his face recently.
He's a sports anchor now.
Oh, on what channel?
I think it's on Fox.
I must have seen him commentating over the past few seasons.
That's very likely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football season is here are you excited as I am?
Oh yes...I've been waiting since January.I know my Atlanta Falcon's "Dirty Birds" will win the Superbowl this year.
Only in your dreams my friend, they don't stand a chance against the Saints!
Please we have dominated the Saints for the past two years! Who Dat! They're nobody.
That's what your hoping, but the Saints will run over the Falcons like a Mack truck.
Not with the Matt Ryan and Julio Jones on the field think again.
Matt Ryan? He was a one time show not again.
Man you crazy, the Saints have no answer for us!
The Falcon's have no room to talk when they let the Patriots come back in the SuperBowl to win the Championship.
Frankly, I think the game was fixed.
Come on brother, the Falcons got clipped.
We all know that The Patriots have have been known to do shady stuff to get a win. Did anyone check the balls?
Oh my God, that was a low blow even for you, this may have been the first season they did not cheat.
That's what you think once a cheater always a cheater. Belichick and Brady are like Bonnie and Clyde.Sad!
Well, I can agree with that they are shady. Two Championships won, but will always be in question.
I know the Falcons all year have always taken the lead in games and then in the second half they go cold as hell, but they played that whole game with heart.
Sure they did, that is why the Patriots won.
At least we made it to the SuperBowl, where were the Saints?
We under performed last season which happens sometimes with many teams. The important thing is how you rebound and the Saints will watch and learn.
Your right, watch how we roll this year, through the Saints and all our opponents. "Dirty Birds" Fly Falcon's Baby!

We're getting closer to the start of the new NFL season with each passing day!
I know! GOOOO PACKERS! They finally got some help for Aaron Rodgers.
Haha, not as much help as you think. I have the Lions winning that division.
Stafford is good, but he's not that good. Rodgers is still the best QB and that's what wins in the NFL.
Well, at least we agree it won't be the Vikings.
No, definitely not. They don't have a running game since Peterson left.
And the Bears are atrocious.
Chicago should not have traded up for Trubisky. The upcoming draft is going to be so much better for QBs.
They'll be picking high in the draft again with how bad their team is. I actually think Trubisky could be good but not anytime soon.
Mike Glennon will never be good.
Hah! Who do you have coming out of the AFC?
Brady just keeps going and going, like the Energizer Bunny.
Yeah, he works hard to stay at the top, but he's almost 40 years old.
He takes care of himself, personal trainers, specialized diet and all that. He could play for a bunch more years even.
The two other teams I think could beat New England in the AFC are Kansas City and the Raiders.
Oakland gets Derek Carr back and could be a threat but I can't see Alex Smith outgunning Tom Brady.
Pat Mahomes will be in there sooner rather than later, mark my words. Big arm throwing deep to Hill and Kelce.
That's an intriguing visual but, as a rookie QB, those deep throws often end up directly at a defender. And he's a gunslinger, he'll try it and fail before he learns.
One thing about the NFL is, there are always unexpected big jumps. We're making our best guesses but they'll probably turn out wildly wrong.
Yup. Jacksonville Jaguars, the next Super Bowl Champs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about last years NFL games?
I didn't watch last years season.
You didn't watch? You love football.
I was so disgusted with the Colin Kapernick crap I decided to protest the NFL.
You mean the kneeling down during the national anthem?
Yes. It was disgraceful and so disrespectful that I just didn't watch.
You didn't see a single game?
Nope I refused to support the NFL when they allow this blatant show of disrespect.
But weren't you in the military? Isn't free speech what you believe in?
Yes but these gentlemen are role models for the younger generations. They should find a different way to protest.
So you think they should follow different rules?
No but the NFL is an entity that represents things that the younger generations strive for. They have a moral and social responsibilities.
So you think it hurt the NFL for him to kneel?
Not just the NFL but society as well. People started doing it at all sport games. It spread like wildfire.
And you think this is more the NF's fault than the player?
Yes because as an entity that receives as much money as they do from the public they have a moral obligation to that public. The players have to follow a morality contract?
Do you think the players kneel went against that morality clause in their contract?
Yes because the level of disrespect they showed was not just to the flag but to every military person, every citizen in our great nation. And they make millions with no retribution for their disrespect.
So wouldn't they be showing their freedom of speech though?
If you are paid that much money to entertain the citizens of this amazing nation you are held to a higher moral, social and ethical standard. There were other ways he could have gotten his point across.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what NFL team do you think will win it all this season?
I'm going to go with the Seahawks.
The Seahawks?!
Yes, this team has made it to the superbowl back to back. Loss one and won one.
So what, so has the Cowboys. Matter fact the Cowboys made it to the Superbowl more than the Seahawks.
Are the Cowboys your team?
No. I follow the Buccaneers
Now that is a struggling team.
Every team has a weak spot.
Yeah and one of yours seems to be the kicker.
Who, Robert Aguayo?
Yes, I hear his preseason practice isn't going so well. He is showing some lack in fundamentals and consistency.
Well as they say, "practice makes perfect."
I don't know about that. I think there is talk about bringing in another kicker and just keeping Aguayo on the roster.
That maybe a choice they make; they can't get rid of him though, because his contract is good for another year.
I guess you will just have to wait and see what the Bucs want to do with Aguayo for the season.
No matter the outcome, the Bucs are still my team.
I wasn't trying to change that. I know how it is to be a loyal fan to a team that let's you down.
Got to keep your hopes up and root for the best.
Your right. After all, it's just fun and games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
the eagles fell apart last season.
what you mean?
i think them dudes was like 5-0 when they played the packers last season.
naw i don't think so.
what you mean?
they played the packers the eleventh game of the season.
wow, i was way off.
they still fell apart though.
yeah, they actually started off 3-0 and was 5-5 when they played the packers.
and then the packers went bonkers.
what you mean?
after the packers beat philly, they didn't lose again until in the playoffs.
that's right. who did they lose to in the playoffs?
the falcons.
yeah that's right. i think the packers might do something this season.
well every season they have rogers they have a chance.
i know that's right.
hard to believe he was a backup for all them years.
that's because brett favre was in the way.
was in the way like a maw effer my dude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading an article the other day about NFL cheerleaders.
Anything interesting?
Yes. I couldn't believe what they make in a season!
I have no clue. A lot?
No far from it. The elite cheerleaders make 3000-3500 dollar in wages.
That is preposterous!
The less seasoned girls make 1500-2000 dollars a season.
That has to be less than minimum  wage.
Yeah  a cheerleader from the Oakland Raiders sued the franchise for paying them $5.00 hr which is less than minimum wage.
Did they win?
Yes it was 1.25 million dollar settlement.
Hey I found a fun fact. The first ever cheerleader squad was of Baltimore Colts which was established in 1954.
I had no idea it was that long ago.
Did you know that there are some famous people who used to be professional cheerleaders in their younger days?
Will I be surprised ? I know that some are professional people in their respective kinds of jobs.
Two well know actresses Teri Hatcher and Megan Fox were professional cheerleaders.
Do you know what teams they cheered for?
No I have no idea about Megan Fox but Teri Hatcher cheered for  San Francisco 49ers
What about the ones now who are people with regular jobs.
One I know is a Doctor and one is a chemical engineer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about the NFL.
Sounds good to me.
What is your favorite team?
The Patroits.
Mine too!
Do you have a favorite player?
No, actually I don't.
That is rather interesting.
Brady is decent though.
I agree, no one is like him.
Have you been to any games recently?
No I have not.
That is too bad.
Yeah but hopefully next year I can go.
Have you watched all of the games?
Yeah.
Were you happy with the SuperBowl win?
Totally!
Well it was great talking to you!
Same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tom Brady's had several concussions, do you think he's still going to be any good?
I don't think he'll have any effects from the concussions, but he is getting old.
Think he should throw in the towel and retire?
No, not after he just won one of the most amazing Super Bowl comebacks ever.
It was a pretty impressive comeback. I felt bad for the Falcons.
Yeah, I felt sorry for Matt Ryan. He seems like a good guy.
What about Matt Stafford? Is he ever going to do anything with the Lions?
I don't know, the Lions need another receiver like Megatron.
Who is Megatron?  Must be a nickname.
Calvin Johnson, one of the best wide receivers ever.
Okay, I remember him. Didn't he retire early?
Kind of early, but he was having a lot of trouble with his knees.
I can't imagine playing in the cold weather is very easy on somebody with bad knees.
I wonder if that's why Barry Sanders retired from the Lions so early.
I don't know, I bet either one of them would have stuck it out for another year if they thought the Lions had a chance of winning a Super Bowl.
I've seen some pretty cold games between the Packers and the Bears. They've been to a few super Bowls.
I think the Bears have only won one Super Bowl. 1985, and that had more to do with their defense.
I imagine cold-weather teams are better off with a good defense. It must be hard to catch a ball when your fingers are cold.
Probably true. I wonder why Green Bay has never built an indoor stadium.
Probably because of the mystique surrounding Lambeau Field. A new stadium wouldn't have the same appeal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Marcus Allen?
Or sure, played for USC
Yeah and the Raiders
Oh yeah I remember that.
Yeah, he was a great running back.
Didn't he win a Super Bowl with them.
Yes, two times I believe.
Did he finish his career with them?
No, he ended up playing for the Chiefs for awhile
The Chiefs of Kansas City?!
That's the one.
Man I had no idea.
Yeah, Joe Montana played with them for a bit as well.
Man, land of the washed up players.
Well I think he was still pretty good with them.
How many Super Bowls did he win in total?
I think just that one.
Oh really, I thought the Raiders won more.
They did earlier, but not recently.
That's too bad for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi! Are you an NFL fan?
Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan. What team do you support?
I've always liked the Packers.
Who do you think is a better quarterback, Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers?
I'd have to say Rodgers. If you look at his stats, he blows Brady out of the water.
As a Pats fan, I'd have to disagree and say Brady. Stats aren't everything.
If stats aren't important, why do you think Brady is better then?
He has had more success as a quarterback, and obviously has the leadership skills to lead a team to the super bowl multiple times.
Still, football is a team sport. The Packers have struggled because of their lack of a good defence.
Brady also has more experience, and has a clutch factor that is rarely seen elsewhere.
I'd have to argue that Rodgers has the same, if not better.
True, I did see some of the miracle games last season.
That said, I would still favor your team over mine for this season.
Why do you say that?
Well until Brady retires, he has a better overall team.
That's probably true, considering what you said about your defence.
Hopefully he'll age out soon though, he's getting really old.
As long as he doesn't retire before we see a Packers and Patriots super bowl.
Agreed, that would be one to go down for the ages.
And it would be a perfect ending to Brady's career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think of the NLF Hall of Fame class for 2018?
Some interesting names, I think Ray Lewis and Steve Hutchinson are the only first balloters.
You don't have Randy Moss as first ballot?
No, he's close but there is such a logjam at wide receivers.  If Owens doesn't make it I don't see how Moss does.
The Owens thing was for off the court behavior, and besides Moss was better at his prime.  He'll get in.
Do you think Owens ever gets in?
Definitely, I am not sure how often two players of the same position get in the same year though, so he may have to wait even longer.
That hurts Urlacher too.  He played the same position as Ray Lewis.
Yup, besides he is not quite a first balloter to me anyway.  But he will get in.  Who else do you have?
I think Ronde Barber gets in eventually, but he will have to wait?
And what about Richard Seymour?
Going to be tough for him.  His style of play didn't really create the sacks, and people will forget how he changed the flow of a game.
Do you think Tagliabue will get in?
No idea.  An argument can be made just to include every commissioner.  Probably not this year though.
Who else do you think will get in?
Not sure, how many slots are there anyway?
There is no firm number, but somewhere between 4 to 8 players.
In that case I think Tony Boselli and Faneca also makes it.
Boselli might deserve it as a player, but I hated him as an annoucer.
Yeah, he was pretty bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's that time, NFL season is closing in. Who in your eyes will be the team to beat?
Well not much of a shocker here but I see that the Patriots will be that team you want to beat.
They did go 17-2 last season and gathered up their fifth Lombardi trophy.
Indeed, and with the additions of a few players they look even better on paper for this season.
Better than a 17-2 winning season?
Well, I am not saying it will be a better record but it is going to be just as good maybe a game better.
I can see another team being right there and that is Okland. Snapping their 13-year playoff drought, might have ignited the fire in this franchise.
Agreed, with a playmaker like Marshawn Lynch and Amari Cooper, not to mention a 100% Derek Carr....this could be their year.
Don't forget Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin, their edge rush defense is going to be one to watch out for.
Exactly, Raiders are as talented as any team out there.
What about those Green Bay Packers?
With a man like Aaron Rodgers, having an NFL history with career passing efficiency rating over 100! I don't see much trouble for them to grab another NFC North title this season.
That is a weapon within itself but lets not forget he has a new weapon in tight end Martellus Bennett! Mix him in with Randall Cobb and Jordy Nelson.
Oh yeah, NFC North is pretty much booked unless a team can step up to the challenge.
So with those teams in the spotlight who do you think will turn out on top?
Each team will win 13 games, that I can say.
You did not answer the question as to which team do you believe will do it?
I will have to say that the Atlanta Falcons will do it!
Wait wait! We did not bring the Falcons into the mix.
I guess that I must explain another time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What afc team do you think will make the SUPERBOWL this year?
I'm sure it's not the jets.
Oh boy,I have to agree on that.
They are brutal.
The organization is terrible.
They have been for years.
I think New England gets back again.
You can never count them out.
Not while Tom Brady is still at quarterback.
Not while bill belichek is head coach either.
He's the best head coach in football.
I can't disagree with that.
I loved him as Giants defensive coordinator under bill parcels.
He was great.
They made quite the team together.
Yes they did.
Do you think belle he's made the right move leaving The jets?
Wow,I guess we know the answer to that.
Parcels had him all set up.
Or at least he thought he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the NFL going to have a game or two in England again this year?
I don't know, but I wish they'd stop that.
Why?
It robs one group of fans a home game every year. Some people save up for these games and have less chances to see it.
But it exposes the NFL to other countries.
That's all well and good, but save it for pre-season scrimmages.
That's a great idea!
I know, I should be the commissioner.
You'd have my vote.
Why should a game that counts towards the season be played in another country with a different time zone?
Oh yeah, the time zone.
They're basically playing at 8am, which is ridiculous for eastern teams, but 5am for those on the west coast!
That always bothered me about sports in general: late games for east teams on the west coast, and vice versa.
As commissioner I'd get rid of that.
So, is that your only solution for NFL in Europe?
Yeah, but I love the whole exhibition thing. Maybe take the top CFL team and have them play a team from the NFL.
That'd be a disaster for the CFL.
Not really. They'd get paid a lot, probably, that should help.
They'd lose.
Well...not against the Lions. Ha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm ready for this NFL game party.
You get the chips?
Yes, of course!
Ok, let's wear our team uniforms.
Ok, let's do it!
I've got my Raiders cap on.
This game will be a good season finisher.
If the Raiders win!!
But they won't.
Oh, please.  We've got a brand new coach now.
What's your point?
We've got new ideas and concepts to beat y'all!
Give us a run for our money.
We didn't make the Superboel, but we will.
When?
One day.
Well, focus on winning for now.
Oh, we've got this.
Ok cool.
Party time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who ends up starting for the Texans this year?
Tom Savage will be the guy from day 1
Has he ever shown he can play in the league?
No but that doesnt matter much apparently
Why not sign Kap for just the veterans minimum.
They dont want the headache I guess.
But what has Savage ever done that shows hes competent?
He looked better than Osweiler in the playoff game.
Please, Carr wasnt even playing in that game.
I admit that you are right.
So does Watson come in by game 2?
I think Bill O Brien will slowly bring him along.
You think hes worth the first rounder?
No because of the spread offense he played in.
Yeah I think hes going to be typecasted into a certain role.
This is what was wrong with the NFL.
Why? Because hes black?
Yeah most of the QBs who enter the league are assumed to be runners.
I dont think anyone thinks that with Winston.
He is a whole different breed
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about going to an NFL game this season?
I would love to see the Seattle Seahawks play.
Really, why that team?
They have a strong defense with Jarran Reed.
He is an amazing player.
Yes, he carried the team and led defensively.
He didn't let anyone get by him.
I know, it was fantastic to watch him.
What other teams should we look out for?
The Ravens Joe Flacco will put on a great show again.
He is a standout as well.
He is paid quite well I hear too.
The NFL players make a lot of dough.
I wish I were one.
Yes, but your body takes a beating.
That's for sure.
But, the muscle power is standout.
I wish I had those muscles.
Being on TV wouldn't be so bad, too.
That would be a blast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Heu are you ready for the Patriots to win the superbowl?
Yhea right that is not going to happen.
Your just jealous of how good my team is.
No i feel sad for your team since they have a sad girly quarterback.
Tom Brady is the best in the whole NFL.
Hey just out of curiosity who owns the Patriots
Robert Kraft is the actual owner of The Patriots team.
Do you know when he purchased the franchis and for how much?
He bought the team for 175 million dollars in 1994 from James Orthwein
Wow wish i had that much.
Well my Patriots are definatly worth it.
I can name 3 other teams that are better and still not worth that much.
Really go ahead and try.
For one the Steelers
Please the Patriots stomp them consistently.
No they are pretty equal in wins and losses against each other
ok ill give you that the 2 do put on a pretty good game.
Plus the Steelers have 6 superbowl rings i believe your Patriots only have 5
So The Patriots only need one more to tie them
But we all know that wont happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Gotta ask you something
Sure go ahead
Yeah?
Well what's the Dolphins current score
In what What do you mean
Last game of season overall
Well I mean season overall
I am not sure
Can you check
Sure thing
Thanks man
No prob
So what do s it
They are 7-4
7 wins?
Yup
Awesome not to bad
Pretty good actually
Really is
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the minnesoda vikings
They are my favorite team
They had a good year last year
Yes they did
I like one of their wide recievers
Which one?
Rodney adams
He is pretty good
Who do you like?
Stefon Diggs
He is good too
Im ready for football season to start back up
Me too
It is so exciting and fun
It is
When is the vikings first game?
First preseason game is august 10
Against who?
Buffalo bills
That should be fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still think they cheat
Who cheat?
The steelers
What do you mean
I don't think they earned their rings fairly
Uh..
What?
Your wrong
How am I wrong
Because they won fair
You sure none of them cheated
I am sure
How can you be so sure
Because I can be sure
You'd never know if one did
Stop it
Stop what
Saying that
Why though
Because it is ridiculous
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you say is the best wide receiver in the NFL?
You ask me, knowing I'm a Cowboys fan?
Haha, yep, I'm asking!
Dez Bryant, of course!
A predictable answer, but not a ridiculous one. Dez Bryant is really good.
The guy does it all. He's big, he's fast, great hands, explosive after the catch.
He's a heck of a player, but I'm not sure he's #1.
Then who would you pick?
Maybe one of A.J. Green or Julio Jones.
Not going to say that either of those are bad players. I still like Dez best.
Dez is a little bit of a wild card in terms of his emotions and stuff like that, though.
He's had his issues, but I look at production on the field.
I think some of the mental stuff has spilled over into his production at times.
Possibly, but I think he's matured the longer he's been in the NFL.
Give me a guy like Julio Jones who puts his head down and goes to work on the field.
And I say, give me a guy who wears his heart on his sleeve and has passion for the game.
I think the main thing is, give me a guy who's 6'3" and runs like the wind!
Yeah, that always helps!
It's weird to think about a league where Megatron isn't in the conversation.
Yeah, the NFL is less cool with him retired.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the NFL to start in the fall?
I am! Training camp starts in just a few weeks.
Who is looking good?
Well I am a Giants fan, and I am getting worried about Eli Manning's age.
Oh yeah, I feel like he has been around for awhile
Yeah, he is 36 years old.
That is pretty old for an NFL player!
It really is. Hopefully he can get us to the playoffs one more time.
I am more of a Redskins fan.
Oh I don't know much about the Redskins.
They weren't too great last year.
What was their record?
They went 8-7 and had one tie actually, which is pretty rare.
Oh that is weird! Who did they tie?
They tied the Bengals in week eight at the game played in London.
Oh I remember hearing that London might get an NFL team.
Yeah I heard that too. I'm not sure what is happening with that, though.
Me either. That would be pretty cool though.
Yeah, I'd love for the NFL to be more international.
Definitely. It would be awesome if other European nations created teams too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What sport do you think is the most watched?
In the world or in the country?
In the world I think it's soccer, hands-down. In the country, I'd think football.
I guess so. I know I watch it every Sunday, Monday or Thursday when it's in season.
So do I. Do you watch it at home or at a bar?
I tend to watch it at home. I like to feel like I'm getting use out of the cable sports package I've purchased
So do I! I pay so much to get Fox, CBS, ESPN, and NBC just to make sure I can see every game.
ESPN is so expensive for me. I wish I could just watch everything online.
They're really strict about that. I don't think you can really watch it for free online nowadays.
I pay so much at this rate I might as well just pay to go a couple game a season.
If you're serious about going I would go with you.
We really should. Hard Rock Stadium is pretty easy to get to from here.
To be honest though I would only go depending on who they're playing.
Have some faith in our Miami Dolphins!
Sorry, I don't deal with faith. I deal with results.
Yes, they have been disappointing these past few seasons.
Completely disappointing.
We need to have another legend like Dan Marino!
Well he wasn't the only great player on the team, but he motivated the entire team to compete well amongst each other as well as against other teams.
Yes exactly. Having one key player makes the entire team perform greater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch any of the game last night?
Dude, it was amazing, the way ward came down with it on the ten the hard way then ran it back 90 yards.
I'm still in shock on that one.
I can't believe they came back from it; I mean three sack in a row then a soft pitch on the off hand.
I was almost hiding behind my couch after the second one.
I was too, then when I saw him catch it I almost hit the ceiling.
I knocked over my girl trying to get a better view.
How did that go over?
She clocked me in the jaw cause I was blocking her view of the screen.
That is funny man, when's there next game?
Thursday, at Dallas; it's gonna be epic.
I can't wait, do you want to watch at my place, just got a new 4k TV, the picture is crystal.
That would be awesome, I'll bring the refreshments.
Better bring some extra, you remember what happened the last time we played Dallas.
Don't worry I'll bring my helmet this time, just remember your pads.
Will do, I can't wait to see Brown running circles around them.
I just hope Big Ben is doing alright by then, he's gotta be sore after all those hits.
He'll be fine, he's got the iron curtain to shield him.
I'm hoping this is our year to go all the way up the stairway.
Seven rings would make my decade.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the New Orleans Saints are going to do this season?
I think they'll do okay since they picked up Adrian Peterson and some other new players.
I'm thinking they'll win 8 or 9 games this season but not more than that.
They made some improvements on offense, but they also lost some quality players at wide receiver.
That's true but I think a 8 or 9 game win season is very possible.What do you think?
I figure that they'll win 6  games this season...maybe 7 but that's about it.
Why are you thinking so few?
Well, they did do some improvements on offense, but they didn't do anything to improve their defense.
You do have a point as that could be a huge problem once again.
Yep, I have no idea why they chose not to improve the defense.
Me neither as they had chances in the draft to pick up some youth and free agency had some good players available.
I know, but for some reason they concentrated on offense again.
So true as the fact that their defense was weak really cost them last season.
Definitely as it doesn't do any good to lead the league in scoring if you are the worst in the league in points given up per game.
Sadly, it been that way for the last several years.
I have no idea what Sean Payton is thinking as if he doesn't coach the team better this year, he'll be fired.
I am thinking the same way as he has had plenty of time to get the team to improve.
I know, the last few years haven't been great and I think that he's just not coaching material anymore.
We'll have to see how this season goes.
Yep, if it goes poorly, he's going to be out of a coaching position.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So something i've always wondering.
What is that?
Well, when Field Goals are kicked, If you are in a stadium, even unenclosed, where does the wind come from that pushes the ball.
I've thought of something like that. i can see it in unenclosed stadiums but in an enclosed stadium it should not happen.
But i have seen games in enclosed stadums where it HAS happened.
Oh, at least 2 or 3 times last seson alone i saw it on TV.
It is definately strange.
I'm sure there is some kond of air flow in both kind of stadiums just so fans and players can breathe but to make a ball move?
Well, think how much force you would need to force air thru aa 60,000 seat stadium.
I presumed it was done in sections.
i honestly do not know.
hm.... something we should look up.
I guess the question is how do kickers and punters DO make it with breezes and air flow.
Well, other than LOTS of practice they watch the flags on the goal post to look for breeze.
True, you see them adjust a lot.
I also see a lot of balls curving real close to the end zone but straight and true up until that point.
Yeah, that always puzzles me.
Could be just the knetic energy fading out from the kick.
You think?
It's a possibility.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the top contenders this year?
Hard to say, there have been a lot of changes this offseason.
Do you think the Patriots will be in the Superbowl?
Probably, they added Cooks which is a huge weapon.
Yeah, Brady needs to stay healthy.
It is uncommon for someone his age to have great success.
If anyone can do it it is him.
Yes, his exercise and diet routine allow him to live like he is 25.
I heard he goes to bed everyday by 8pm.
That should help him stay healthy.
Even if he is hurt they have some good backups.
I dont know about them, what makes you think they are good?
Do you remember last season when Brady was suspended for the first four games?
Yea, the deflategate punishment.
Right, well Garappolo started and they won several games.
Didnt Garappolo get hurt though?
Yes against Miami at home, but Brissett came in and they won that game.
Well I would say they have some pretty good backup quarterbacks then.
Thats why they are going to the Superbowl again this year.
I dont know, but if they make it they will probably win it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite team?
The Denver Broncos?
How do you think they'll do this year?
I'm not sure.
What about the team arent you sure about?
First off, the quarterback.
Who is their quarterback?
Trevor semian and paxton lynch are expected to compete for the starting job.
Who do you think will win?
Im really not sure.
Who do you want to win?
Im hoping Lynch will step up and be the quarterback of the future.
How about the receivers?
They still have Demarius Thomas which is good.  I dont know who else will be a playmaker.
Their defense was good.  Is it still good?
I dont know.
Do they still have Von Miller?
Yes.  He is the center of the defense.
Do you think they can beat the Raiders this year?
Im not that hopeful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's your favorite sport?
Football is my number one.
I love the NFL as well.
Who's your favorite team?
I grew up in New York, so I've always been a Giants fan.
Wow, I grew up in New York too and I'm a Jets fan.
Who was your favorite Jet ever?
Ken O'Brien was my guy back in the day, and you?
Lawrence Taylor from the powerhouse teams of the 1980's.
Yeah, he was one of the best I have ever seen.
You can't be too happy with where the Jets are at right now.
Nothing but more pain as a Jets fan.
Who's going to be the quarterback this year?
Josh McCown probably, but who knows for sure.
At least the Giants have stability at the QB position.
I wish the Jets could find someone like Manning for themselves.
Maybe one of your recent draft choices can be the man.
I'd like to think so, but I'm not holding out much hope.
Anyway, good luck to the Jets this year.
Good luck to the Giants as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi!  Are you ready for football season to start?
Oh yeah!  How about you?
Definitely!  It's the only sport I watch!
Oh, cool!  I watch a few but football is my favorite!
That's cool!  What's your favorite team?
I'm a huge Cowboys fan!  You?
Oh no!!  Eagle's all the way!
Oh boy!  Eagles??
Yes sir!  I am a huge Eagles fan!
Well I hope you are looking forward to losing!
Haha!  Yeah, well we aren't the greatest team.
That's for sure!
I know, we suck sometimes but we have passion!
Yeah, Eagles' fans are known for their passion.
Yes we are!  We can lose every game but not one fan will give up on our boys!
Well maybe that will happen this year... lose every game.  Just kidding!
Preseason starts soon, so we will see.
Yes, I cannot wait!  Our first game is against the Giants.
We play the Redskins first.  It's going to be a great season!
Yes I agree!  Cannot wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the NFL season to start back?
I sure am, doesn't pre-season start soon?
Yes, it usually kicks off in August.
I am still in shock over last season's super bowl.
I know right! The Falcons dominated the first half!
Then, the Falcons lost all sense of how to play football!
Yes!  The Patriots staged the single handed greatest comeback of all time.
The Patriots tied the game and took it to over time in which they eventually won!
Tom Brady was named MVP for the greatest comeback of all time!
I tend to thing the Falcons defense should have been the MVP.
Why is that?
The Falcons performed the greatest choke of all time.
Your right about that!  The Falcons practically gave the game away!
At the end of the first half, the Falcons were ahead 21-3.
However, in the 4th quarter, the Patriots scored 19 unanswered points.
yes, and what was so amazing was they scored extra points after each touchdown.
Your right, they were unstopable in the 4th quarter!
You could feel the momentum and knew that the Patriots would win in over time.
Yes you could, and as expected the Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl.
Indeed, making it one of the greatest comebacks of all time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights of Superbowl XXXIX.
The Patriots' third Superbowl championship?
Yes, this time not won by a last minute field goal.
Philadelphia was a worthy opponent.
They had a 13-3 record that year.
It was a pretty tight game, I recall.
0-0 at the end of the first quarter.
Who scored first?
Philadelphia, but the Pats tied it up.
The halftime show was tame compared to last year.
I heard Paul McCartney was a safe choice.
What happened in the third quarter?
The Pats scored, but the Eagles tied it.
So it was tied going into the fourth quarter?
Yes, 14-14.
Who scored next?
The Patriots, a touchdown and a Vinateri field goal, 24-14.
But McNabb came back with a td pass, 24-21.
But there was almost no time left, and the Pats intercepted in the end.
The dynasty was established.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the Gators?
No, what happened?
They cut 3 players at once.
Really?
Yeah.  They are bringing in new players soon.
That's pretty brutal, huh?
Yes it is.
Usually, it's one by one right?
Yeah, but coach said they needed big change.
Any major players?
You might know Brock Berrens.
Oh yeah, Big Brock!
He's gone.
Dang.
Chris Tomlinson is out too.
He wasn't THAT bad.
Guess coach thought he was.
True.
Last player was a bench warmer.
Name unknown.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who has cohosted the football morning show?
Steven A has guess hosted, but they have had a few NFL players like Linsalto and Johnson.
Calvin Johnson cohosted?
Yes, he is actually a regular on that show.
Tell me about. Cutler, who thought of this guy?
I can't imagine.
Rodgers can be cast off as well.
That's an away game.
No, he's a good sport.
He only mentioned his workout routine.
I think they are rotating rookies until his return.
Do they have any new football shows?
They don't really have anything new.
It's like the new coach is being set up to fail.
Either than or they trying to makes sure the team doesn't sale.
I didn't even know their contracts were up.
Cam Newton stood out more to me than Roethlisberger ever did.
How on earthy do they strategize by rotating starters?
The Rams had four coaches in five seasons.
Now there is a biasis opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your prediction for the Super Bowl this year?
I wish an unexpected team would take it but it will probably be someone like the Patriots again.
Which team do you think would be the most surprising to go there?
There are a few, but probably the most surprising would be the Browns.
I can only imagine Vegas going nuts if the Browns were the AFC champions this season!
Yeah, I cannot imagine anyone betting on them. I imagine the AFC champs will be the Patriots.
I want to like them, just because of Brady's athleticism, but I just don't care for the coaching staff or the egos on the team.
Yeah, Belichick is the kind of coach that you either love or you hate. As for me, I have mad respect for what he has done.
He is definitely a good coach, but there are just too many questionable things about his coaching style. I'd rather root for players than coaches anyway.
So even if you go that way, you kind of have to admit that Brady is definitely the best quarterback in the game right now.
Yeah, there is no denying his talents, that's for sure. I always pick him for my fantasy team when I can.
I try to do the same, but too many people want him for their team. I like Carr and Roethlisberger too.
I don't know a lot about Carr, but I really like what I have read. He is the highest paid quarterback now!
I read about that, he got a 125 million dollar contract. I hear he is a really good guy, plus his stats are pretty amazing.
I still think I would choose Big Ben over Carr, just because he has experience.
That's true, plus the Steelers have been maturing as a team the last couple of years. They are bound to give the Patriots a run for their money.
It is funny how everything comes back to the Patriots. I guess that is what happens when you have the best team in the league.
Yeah, but they also have an old team too, at least it is getting that way.
True. I am going to cheer for them, but I hope that the Giants pull out the big win this year.
I am going with the Raiders myself. I think Carr is going to really prove himself this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Redskins are going to own this year.
That's a bold statement.
Just a fact.  This is their year.
Explain what leads you to believe this.
For one, they've got the best QB in the league.
You're a funny guy, aren't you.
I'm telling you, Kirk Cousins is the future.
He's a decent QB, but the best?  You're crazy.
Name three quarterbacks better than him?
Three?  I'll give you five.  Rogers, Brady, Prescott, Ryan, Wilson...
Those guys are all overrated.
Yeah, okay.  You're being such a homer.
Look at what Cousins did last year with nothing.
What do you mean nothing?  Their OL was okay.
But they had no receiving help.
No, they had some.  They went and drafted a billion this year I think.
That's because guys like Crowder are good, but not #1's.
Yeah, but not sure if they've got anybody that puts fear in defenses.
Well, just saying, they are going to surprise this year.
Maybe.  I would be surprised if they surprise me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many teams are in the NFL?
There are 32 teams at the moment.
So, there's an NFL team in 32 cities?
No, some cities have two teams.
Which ones?
New York has two teams.
Which two teams?
The New York Giants and the New York Jets.
What other city has two teams?
Los Angeles has two teams as well.
What are their names?
It's the Los Angeles Chargers and the Los Angeles Rams.
The Los Angeles Chargers? I thought that the Chargers were in San Diego.
They just moved.
When?
They will play in Carson, California -- a suburb of Los Angeles -- this fall.
Is that their permanent home?
No, they are moving to Inglewood as soon as possible.
When is that change expected?
Their new stadium is expected to be finished in 2020.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the AFC East?
Well, doesn't it start and end with the New England Patriots>
Certainly, but have they changed enough?
Yes.   First, there's Brandin Cooks.
A hot wide receiver, sure to improve the position.
A big loss for New Orleans.
Definitely, but they are already packed there.
For sure, but I would be surprised if they don't hold on to at least five guys.
OK, so the Patriots are your pick.
The division should be easy, a decent chance at a championship repeat.
What about the rest of the division?
The Dolphins have their Tannehill issue at Quarterback.
So you see problems all year?
Yes.     He is good, but cannot carry a team.
So, what about the bottom dwellers?
The Buffalo Bills are bad.
Still, you don't see them as a last place team?
No, they still have enough talent to keep their heads above water.
That leaves the New York Jets.
Yes.      The Jets are easily the worst team in the division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate how long the off season is for football.
It's only a few weeks.
a few weeks too long.
Well, your favorites probably enjoy the off season.
Why would they? They love playing.
So that they can rest up.
What do they need rest for?
for injuries they get while playing.
Yeah I guess that's true.
They also probably like spending time with their families.
I didn't think about that.
Do you still think the off season is too long?
Yes, but I see why it's necessary at least.
Well, that's come progress.
I'm not saying they don't deserve time off.
What are you saying then?
I'm just saying that I love football, and I miss watching it.
I miss it too, buddy.
We could always watch some old games.
Yeah! Let's do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard the Chiefs are looking for a new running back.
They should could use one and defensive end too.
Do you think inflate-gate was something real?
I don't like the Patriots that much but I don't think letting a little air out of the ball is going to matter.
Do you think New England will win the Superbowl again?
I don't know who else is going to knock them off, maybe the Cowboys.
Are you sick of all the pink gear in the NFL?
Nah, that's OK, I'm just sick of all the politics and the high ticket prices.
What happened to ESPN?  The can't even talk football without some political slant.
Yeah, I'm sick of it.  They should stick to the game.  People watch the NFL to get away from politics.
Do think the Browns will ever win the Superbowl.
Yep, as soon as pigs fly and hell freezes over.
I think the Chiefs are going to be better this year.  They haven't lost anyone major.
They should.  They finished strong but they still have an anemic offense.
It's not fair.  New York has two NFL teams and they both suck
The Giants aren't all that bad if you can stand the fans.
I heard Kaepernick went to Chad or somewhere in Africa.
That's a good place for him.  Nobody wants him in the U.S. except the flag burning types.
The Lions traded for a new defensive end.
They need guards and tackles.  Their offensive line is like Swiss cheese.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you familiar with how the NFL draft works?
I've followed it some, sure. Why?
Its something I've always been interested in. I don't always follow it.
Yeah sometimes I'm too busy to take much notice either.
But you have an understanding of how it works?
I guess so, its not too difficult.
Every spring the NFL drafts college football players.
What's the process used?
There are 7 rounds. Each club in each round takes their pick.
That's the easy part! Who picks first?
Playoff teams are ranked on the furthest round of playoff levels reached, plus their season record.
See I didn't know that. What then?
The order for non-playoff teams is driven by the season record.
Okay, I've got it.  You would think the Super Bowl winners had earned first draft.
No they actually pick last in each round.
Not much of a payoff.
Yeah, right after the worst performing team has their pick.
The draftees, they can be pretty young then?
At least three years out of high school!
Not a bad career for kids with the right skills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
OK, so who would you list as the greatest NFL quarterbacks of all time.
That is tough. So many factors go into the rankings, and it can be hard to compare QBs of different eras.
Well, I guess the most important question is: do Super Bowl wins matter?
I don't think they do. Winning a Super Bowl is a team accomplishment; many great QBs had to carry their teams.
So you're saying someone like Dan Marino shouldn't be left out just because the rest of the Dolphins couldn't get it together enough to pull off the big win?
Exactly. Marino had some amazing stats and even held the touchdown record at one point.
Still, if you HAD to make a list, where would you start?
I suppose the current obvious choice for a top pick is Tom Brady.
That man is a machine. Hardly feels like he's been aging atl.
Right? He's been in the league going on 18 seasons now and has only missed the post-season ONCE.
His win percentage is something ridiculous too, isn't it?
It was over 75% (.773) last I looked. Just incredible.
OK, so who else? Can't forget Joe Montana.
Definitely not. Montana is a legend. Brett Favre, too. Peyton Manning. Dan Marino.
Here's a good one: Joe Montana or Steve Young?
Oh, easy. Montana all the way. He has a higher win percentage.
I bet the 49ers would kill to have either of them playing for them now, eh?
Yeah, that 2-14 regular season record in 2016 was painful to watch.
Who even is their current QB?
Brian Hoyer and Matt Barkley. I don't think either has been named starter for the new season yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me, what was Deflategate all about?
The Patriots were accused of underinflating balls during a playoff game.
Which one?
The AFC championship game.
What happened?
The Colts alleged the balls were underinflated.
How did they know?
The measured an intercepted ball.
What happened next?
The officials measured the ball pressures at halftime.
And?
They said 11 out of 12 balls were underinflated.  They added air to the balls.
Who won the game?
Patriots, 45-7.
Then what?
The NFL had an investigation in 2015.
What was the result?
The NFL concluded the Patriots and Brady were at fault.
What was the punishment?
Brady got suspended for four games and the Pats lost two draft picks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like NFL football?
Yes, football season is my favorite time of year.
Mine too. I get more excited every year.
Do you do fantasy football?
No, I have never really got into it.
I have never played,but was invited to this season.
I just don't think I would want to keep up with it
Yeah, that is my concern. I don't want to get so involved that I worry more about it than my own team.
I could see how that could happen.
Some of my buddies are totally taken by it all. I want to become obsessed.
Maybe you should look into it. Just set yourself some boundaries.
That could work. I will look into it more.
Cool, it could make the game more fun.
Yes, it could offer some extra incentives.
Maybe so. I just don't want to lose much either.
Yeah, football is life.
Exactly, not fantasy.
I hear you.
Just remember your love for the game.
Couldn't forget it if I tried.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the Packers are named after a meat company?
...What?
Yeah, they sponsored them somehow.
Like the workers played for the team, or?
No, it was like a local factory that paid for their jerseys and such.
Oh, like coke does now.
Yeah, but local. They're one of the oldest teams.
I bet they're worth a lot, then.
Yeah, but they're one of the few professional teams you can still buy stock from.
So how come you can't buy stock from other teams?
I don't know if you can't, it's more that you can't just do it from a stoke broker.
Oh. So how do you do it?
Well there's only a small amount, and it's not really seen as an investment.
So you can't make money off it?
You could, but it's more of a family heirloom thing.
Fan cred?
Exactly; it's like how most people don't scalp tickets because they actually want to go to the game. It means something.
That's actually really cool. So are you looking forward to them this season?
Honestly, no. In fact I just read an article about how they're probably doomed this next season.
Ouch. Well, at least they've still got that sweet, sweet fan cred!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some of the legendary coaches in NFL history?
There's one still coaching -- Bill Belichick.
True, but I was looking more for ones from the past.
Vince Lombardi is an all-time great.
Who did he coach?
He coached the Green Bay Packers.
When did he coach?
His best era was the 1960s.
What happened then?
The Packers won 5 championships in 7 years.
Wow, that's impressive!
Yes, and those championships included the first two Super Bowls.
I see. Who else had similar accomplishments?
There are not many other NFL coaches with such a resume.
You can't think of any?
Well, Chuck Noll comes close.
Who did he coach?
Noll coached the Steelers in the 1970s.
What did they accomplish?
They won 4 Super Bowls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Carolina Panthers workout video?
The one with all of the new rookies?
Yeah. It got me pumped for the season.
Me too, I can't wait to see how everybody is going to play.
Same here. Who do you think is going to be good?
I think Christian McCaffrey is already good and is promising.
Yeah, he is quick. He will be good as long as he can stay healthy.
Yes. Talking about health, did you watch the documentary on Calvin Johnson?
No. What was it about?
He was talking about his football career and how he had issues staying healthy.
What did he say about it?
He was explaining that he was on painkillers for a long time and that he was having issues waking up.
Wow. That is kind of the nature of the game.
It is sad to see that occur to people who love the game so much.
Exactly. Do you think Marshawn Lynch will stay healthy?
I believe that he will. He is a strong guy.
He has been training pretty hard in the off-season to get ready for next year.
Yeah. I wonder if he still eats Skittles.
He probably does. Did he ever get an endorsement or contract with them?
I'm really not sure. If not, I sure do hope he does this time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The New Orleans Saints aren't a good team.
Do you think I'm a Saints fan?
No I was just wondering what your response would be to that.
I think they are a solid team.
Could you expand on your argument?
Drew Brees is all I need to say.
He is a pretty good Quarterback.
Did you say he is only pretty good?
Yeah do you have a problem with that?
Is almost 40 touchdowns and over 5,000 yards pretty good to you?
Well you conveniently left out that he had 15 interceptions this season.
That doesn't matter when you throw 40 touchdowns in a season.
That is a good point.
Think about it he almost threw three touchdowns a game!
Not bad at all to be honest.
Says the guy who said the Saints are a bad team.
I told you I was just curious about your reaction!
You aren't necessarily a Saints fan either.
That is true I'm more of a Tampa Bay guy.
Let's not get into that conversation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
CAN'T WAIT FOR FOOTBALL TO START AND I DON'T MEAN PRESEASON!
TELL ME ABOUT IT.....TIRED OF BASEBALL
ANYONE BUT THE PATRIOTS
MY BUCS PICKED UP A COUPLE GOOD ONES AND BETTER THAN YOUR DOLPHINS
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PRECIOUS STEELERS
CAN'T WIN WITHOUT CHANGES AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO DO THAT
THEY NEED TO SIGN BELL AND MAKE HIM HAPPY
OPENING NIGHT IS CHIEFS AND PATRIOTS
SHOULD HAVE FALCONS AND PATRIOTS REMATCH
NO WAY....TOO MANY BAD MEMORIES EVEN FOR ME
PATRIOTS, COWBOYS, AND PACKERS ARE THE FAVORITES TO GO TO SUPER BOWL IN 2018
PACKERS ARE TOO WISHY WASHY AND COWBOYS COULD WITHOUT QUARTERBACK DRAMA LINGERING
I SAW THE STEELERS PICK UP WATT'S LITTLE BROTHER IN THE DRAFT....WONDER IF HE WILL DO THE SAME
I LOVE WATCHING WATT PLAY AND IF HIS BROTHER IS THE SAME THEN HE WILL FIT WELL WITH THE STEELERS
SAINTS AND VIKINGS ARE FIRST MONDAY NIGHT
NOT A BREES FAN ANYMORE
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE A GAME UP IN PACKER COUNTRY WHEN ITS COLD AND SNOWY AND THE FANS ARE CRAZY!!
JUST READY TO WATCH FOOTBALL NO MATTER WHERE....GO STEELERS!
GO BUCS!  GO DOLPHINS!  GO ANYONE BUT  PATRIOTS!  ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL?????
YOU BET I AM!!  SUNDAY...MONDAY...THURSDAY!!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Rams are going to be awful this year.
You think so?  They'll do better than you think.
Nope, they're terrible.  No offense.
Goff had a rough year, but is getting better.
Dude, Goff never got better last year.
Well, he got picked off less as the year progressed.
Yeah, okay, that's some really sound reasoning.
It's a fact though, he's getting better.
Sure, whatever you say.
You can't argue that the defense isn't good though.
I wouldn't say good, but they do have some quality players.
Aaron Donald is the best DT in the league.
No doubt he's good, but not #1.
Name one DT better than him.
Some guy named JT Watt comes to mind.
He was hurt all last year.
So?  Watt's the best player in the league when healthy.
Right, but if he's not healthy, he's just a guy.
Look, not arguing Donald isn't really darn good, just saying that Watt is infinitely better.
Your opinion stinks, but we'll see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
It's fun to watch!
Oh?  Who's your favorite team?
Packers
Oh you like Green Bay?
Yea, man!
They are a decent team
Yea!  What's your favorite team?
The Patriots
Everyone and their mother seems to like them lately
Haha!  JOIN US!
Never!
Come to the dark side!
I can't!
One day we will have you all!
Haha!
Good talk man!
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there! I am trying to decide who is a better football player, Eli or Peyton Manning. What do you think?
I will always like Peyton Manning better.
Why is that?
I mean come on. He is a for sure Hall of Famer and a 5 time NFL MVP. He was unbelievable.
True but Eli Manning is a 2 time Super Bowl MVP.
Peyton has won that award too.
Eli Manning is going to the Hall of Fame too. I mean you can't use that as a comparison.
It is tough to compare the two. They are both so good.
They also both have 2 super bowl rings.
Yeah but when Peyton was on his game, he was so accurate with the ball. He had better location than anyone in the game.
Yes but Eli can beat defense on his feet.
That's true but Peyton doesn't need to beat defense on his feet because he knows the game so well.
What does that mean?
Peyton beats defense with his brain. He knows more about the defense of the other team than the other team knows about themselves.
I guess Peyton is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
He completely is! And look at the record of them playing against each other in the NFL. Peyton's teams have gone undefeated versus Eli.
That's true too. Well maybe you have me on this one.
I think I do.
Ok, so Peyton Manning is the better quarterback. You win.
Ha! I knew I was right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick one WR in the NFL, who would you pick?
Probably Julio Jones... what do you think?
That is a good answer. I sometimes think Odell Beckham Jr is, but he is kinda crazy and inconsistent.
Agreed, but, wow he may have the greatest catch in NFL history.
Oh for sure, but for top catches you gotta talk about Antonio Freeman back in 2001 in that Monday Night Football game vs the Vikings
Oh yeah, and Al Michaels had that iconic Call....
...He did what?!?!
Yup. That's it haha. Oh man, Antonio Freeman. I really like those nostalgic mediocre players that people kinda forget about these days.
Like James Thrash.
Hahah. Exactly. Or like Muhshin Mohhammed.
Oh yeah, from the Panthers and Bears. He was a great possession WR!
Yeah, he was a guy that would have 100 catches and barely 1000 yards!
He reminds me of another Bears possession WR, Marty Booker.
Oh yeah, he was on probably one of the worst 13-3 teams I can ever remember. Jim Miller was the QB!
Yeah, it was kinda silly. The Packers swept the Bears that year and went 12-4 themselves, but didn't even win the division.
Yeah the Packers had a great team that year. I think that year they ended up losing in the playoffs to the Kurt Warner led St. Louis Rams.
Ugh. That game depresses me. I think Favre threw 7 interceptions that game.
Oh what a surprise. Favre throwing interceptions in the playoffs. How typical.
Yup. Live by the Favre, die by the Favre.
At least he threw a horrible game-losing pick for the Vikings in 2009 too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay. What about.....
What about what?
Not sure
Eh, whatever.
Have you heard about the new streaming services?
Yeah, like Netflix, Hulu and other stuff?
What about Twitch?
Twitch doesn't do that much stuff
Why not?
Because that service is usually involved with gaming!
Oh, okay.
But I think IRL's becoming a new thing.
Well, it can't relate to football.
Why not?
Wut is IRL?
It's called In Real Life
Oh.... well in that case, pull it through!
I guess so!
What will we call ourselves as Football Streamers?
Ummm, the Rigging Ballers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the 49er depth chart this year?
Not yet.  Why do you ask?
Because it's arguably the worst in the league.
I thought they were okay on the defensive side.
Their defense is young and they've stockpiled some talent there.
Right, I'm not too concerned about that.
They drafted that Solomon Thomas and he's supposed to be super good.
Plus Eric Reid and a good stable of linebackers.
Defensively, they can hang, it's offense that's the problem.
Their offense is pitiful
With Kaep gone, I think Brad Hoyer is starting?
Seriously?  Yuck, that's all I can say.
It's the worst QB situation in the league by far.
Who's their backup even?
I think it's Matt Barkley who's on his 4th team by now or something.
I can't believe they didn't go after a QB harder.
I imagine that this year's draft will see them look for their next Montana or Young.
I would accept a shell of that over Hoyer.
They will struggle this year.  They just need some playmakers.
Give them a few years and maybe they can push.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The next NFL football season is coming up; what did you think of last season?
I thought that there were some nice surprises. What did you think of the NFC champonship game?
Boy, looked like the Falcons had no competition and ran with the game.
Yeah, those Packers just threw away a possible miracle comeback on two occasions.
How did you like the playoff situation for the NFC South?
I was hoping that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers would have made it in.
Oh, you like the Buccaneers?
Oh, yes, been a fan since 1998.
For real? Why the Buccaneers?
Oh, they once had a spectacular defense and they appeared to be collecting themselves last season.
Oh...ok? The Buccaneers had a good defense?
Oh sure. I may be a little ancient with my statement.
Yeah, I can't remember Tampa Bay ever being a good team.
Well, they earned my respect during the 1999 NFC championship.
Really, how so?
Well, I can remember transferring from a college in Lakeland, FL to a college in St. Louis that year.
Right, didn't the NFC championship have the Rams and Buccaneers facing each other?
Yes, and I'd just started attending a school in St. Louis. There were lots of mouthy St. Louis fans.
Sure, I can imagine; sorry for the disruption, but, the Buccaneers actually earned your respect than?
Yes, believe it or not, word went around that students would get an individual pizza for every touchdown that the Rams beat the Buccaneers by. I was nervously watching the championship game. One the first play, the Buccaneers got an interception. I was so happy that I fell asleep until some point in the 3rd quarter. I can remember that the Buccaneers had shut the Rams down and were up 6 to 0. The stadium was a eco silence with disappointed Rams fans. That stadium silence is what than fill me with respect for the Buccaneers. After the game, even though the Buccaneers lost, there were no pizzas to give.

It's almost football season!
Yes indeed. You ready to see my Lions finally take home the crown?
The Lions!? I believe the Browns before that!
The Browns!? Now you're just purposefully trying to offend me.
Okay, okay. Maybe that's a bit far, but the Lions have a way to go.
I think we got it this year, man. Stafford is maturing every year.
That's true, and he's talented, but the supporting case is terrible!
All we need is a good offense and decent defense, and I think we have that.
No, no. You need an extraordinary defense!
Not for every team. You just need to put up more points than the opponent.
Tell that to the Falcons!
Ouch! That's too soon considering the Falcons are my number two team!
I didn't know that. They should be good this year.
I agree, but I think the Bucs are on the come up.
Yes indeed. I love some Winston.
Yeah, he's gonna be good one day.
He reminds me of Cam, for sure. Has a ton of potential.
I'm not sure about that. He reminds me more of a QB like Big Ben.
That's true. He's not as fast as Cam.
And certainly not as big as Cam!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, I wouldn't bet on the Seahawks. They seem to be trending downwards.
What? Weren't they in the playoffs last year?
Yea, but they lost Marshawn Lynch and just didn't have the same pop.
Yea, I agree to some extent, but they still have an amazing defense.
Yea, if they can keep Richard Sherman's head on straight.
He is a great player, but sometimes he just needs to keep his mouth shut.
Yea, well it seems like if he keeps moving his lips, he may be traded.
Well, if he is traded, I don't know who I would bet to win the NFL or Superbowl.
I would probably expect the Falcons to come out of the NFL.
Yea? You think they could get back to the superbowl?
They might. They have a really strong team.
They do and Matt Ryan is coming off a great season.
Exactly! You never know though. Anybody could have a great year.
Yea, there's always a few other teams to watch.
It's just tough to see anyone taking down the Patriots. They just keep getting better.
Yea, they do, but sometimes age eventually catches up.
Yea, I can understand that, but sometimes I don't know how Bellichek does it.
Me either, the guy just wins.
How many superbowls does he have?
I really don't even know. I lost count.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about all these NFL players who have been getting neurological disabilities after their careers.
It's really scary.
Yeah, it's so odd how that these kind of things weren't really taken seriously.
I think that it was just so new considering the NFL as the sport it is today hasn't been around that long.
I definitely don't think they took stuff like concussions as serious as they do today.
Yeah, it seems like back then, quarterbacks were allowed to go back into a game even after getting one.
It's scary to think what might happen to the quarterbacks from just even a few decades ago.
I agree. You would think that they might suffer some issues.
I hope not. Some of them are some of my favorite players.
Me too. I hope that they're the lucky ones and don't suffer any medical issues years after their careers ended.
I'm just glad the NFL started taking the issue seriously. Their new policies make it safer for players.
Yeah. I also think that they have better technology today, too, like better helmets.
I agree. Some of those helmets look a lot safer.
The only thing I don't like is some of the new rules that they put into place when it comes to playing.
Why don't you like it?
I think it kind of handicaps defensive players a bit. Some of the rules seem a bit soft.
Yeah, I can see that. But I think the NFL has too look at these players' long term health.
I just wish there was a way for them to play like they used to and still have better medical resources to prevent issues later.
I don't think that's possible but hopefully they figure out how to make the NFL safer without sacrificing the game.
I agree with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you think has the best defense in the league?
Well for a while it was the Broncos
Yeah I'd agree but I'm not sure if they still are
I think they are top 3 without a doubt
I think that the falcons also have a really good defense
They have one of the best offenses too
Who do you think has the worst defense in the league?
Well statistically I think the Browns do
I think the Packers also have a horrible defense
Yeah I think their offense props them up a lot
I think they are working on it though
They need to get rid of their defensive coordinator
Yeah but hes been there for so long I doubt it
One can only dream!
I think the seahawks also have a pretty good defense
They have an excellent defensive line
And secondary too with Richard Sherman
They were unable to win the superbowl last year
I think that because their coaching isn't very good
Maybe they will make a change soon
XXXXXXXXXXX
Some people think that Tom Brady is too old to play football.  I think he is a bundle of energy.
How old is he?  Isn't he almost forty?
He is 39.
I know you are his fan.  Good luck to you.
Aren't you a Seahawks' fan?
So-so.  My brother is the real fan in our family and I support him.
I heard that The Seattle Seahawks has just signed a quarterback.
Yes, I think so.  I have not had time following footballs lately.
The new guy's name is Austin Davis.
You more much more about Seahawks than I do even though you are a Patriots' fan.
I like football in general.  I enjoy college football too.
To tell you the truth, I enjoy college football games more than NFL.
Why is that?
Because it is not about money.  Professional football players might not be loyal to their team.
I agree.  They might move to a different team if they got a better offer financially.
That is exactly what I think.
I am going to go to a sports bar for the game.  Let me know if you would like to join me.
I would love to.
Okay.  I will email you the address.
Thank you.  Talk to you later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's with all the football hype?
What do you mean?
Why do Americans like the NFL so much?
Lots of people, myself included, think it's a fun sport to watch.
American football is not a fun sport. Real football is.
You mean soccer.
I mean football.
I'm not saying soccer isn't fun to watch. I love soccer. I just think football is fun too.
Why do they call it football when you don't even kick the ball?
You kick the ball for field goals. But does it matter?
I guess it doesn't. How often do you watch the NFL?
I watch the NFL with my family every now and then.
Do you have a favorite team?
Dallas Cowboys baby!
I have never heard of them.
What teams have you heard of.
Patriots.
Because they keep winning?
Yeah.
Figures.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite team in the NFL?
The Pittsburgh Steelers of course!
Have you seen their schedule for the upcoming year?
Yeah, I have, and it looks pretty good.
What do you like about it?
Well, for one, even thought the team doesn't like it, I am happy they are playing on Christmas this year.
I know what you mean, makes it easier to get a break from all the holiday stuff.
I like that I get to do one of my favorite things on one of the best days of the year.  Watch Steeler Football!
Are they at home at least?
No. Not only do they have to play on Christmas but they also have to travel. They are playing Houston.
The Oilers. Who else do they play this year?  I mean, besides the division games.
The first home game is with the Minnesota Vikings.
Do they start the season at home?
No. They start on the road, against the Browns. They have two divisional games in the first month.
Who do they play after the Vikings?
The play Chicago.
Da Bears.
Da Bears.  And they are on the road for that game as well.
Are they going to be on television this season?
Yes, of course. Five primetime games are scheduled, and the playoffs will be televised, so of course they will be in those!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm worried about the future of the NFL.
Why?
The massive amounts of head and bodily injuries that mess with athletes will overwhelm people.
Really?
Look at how bad these guys turn out. More and more research shows massive injuries that aren't reversible.
But people love football.
Sort of - a lot of kids just like doing it to hurt each other. They can take out their aggression in other ways.
At least the kids like it, though.
I'm not sure they do. The parents hate it.
That's true, I see parents pulling their kids out of little league and high school football.
Less people playing equals less in the NFL.
Or, lowering their standards to allow more in. There will always be people wanting to play.
Ahh, the American dream. Get paid $10 million to play a game instead of a real job.
Ha, that's trivializing it a bit, but point taken.
I hope we find a way to make it safe, or find an alternative.
Americans are just aggressive people.
Yeah, I guess the NFL is safe, but I'm just worried that sentiment will change.
If anything, money will do it.
How so?
If cities stop supporting teams, they'll have to close down. Faded interest does mean the teams leaving.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Jim Bolyes is playing tonight!
Ok, and??
Remember, he's been on a year hiatus.
Why?
He was injured in the left leg and needed to heal.
Wasn't he the running back?
He still is.
Ok.  Do you think he's ready?
Tonight is the big game to find out.
I think he'll do awesome.
Yeah, he's a strong competitor.
He had Tim Longs train him.
The world renown football trainer?
You've got it.
Well, he was in good hands.
Let's see if he holds up.
The game comes on at 8pm.
Ok great, I'll be there.
Alright, I'm putting on my Jim Bolyes jersey!
Ok, me too then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Cowboys this year?
I think Dak Prescott is under pressure for an encore.
Oh ya he definitely will.
Prescott won't be catching anyone by surprise this season.
He's going to be in charge for the first time.
And taking on much more responsibilites.
I hope he can make it through without any problems.
His teammates are urging him to be a more vocal leader.
Ya they need him to show them he want this.
They have a much harder schedule this year too.
Much better defenses he will be facing.
He won't have much room for error.
I hope he doesn't fall into the sophomore slump.
Ya that's taken out many a good quarterback.
Have you been to the new stadium yet?
Oh man that place is huge.
I haven't been able to make it out yet.
I haven't been for a football game but I went down to check it out.
I think I'm going to try and get tickets for a game this year.
Me too we should go together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The raiders are a pretty good team
Yes they are
They were founded in 1960
Wow  they have been around for a while
Yes they have
Its been a while since they have won a superbowl
When was the last time?
1984
Wow
Yes i know
They need a better team
Oh a better coach
Jack madden was the best
Yes he was a really good coach
They need another cosch like him
Definitely
I cant believe its been that long since they won
Me either
They need another one
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm checking out the highlights from the game.
What happened?
Looks like the Lions won by a landslide.
I like be my Lions.
They are doing great this season.
I've heard!
I'll be attending a home game.
I'll go with!
I know it will be good.
I've never been to a boring Lions game.
Me neither!
They even beat the Wolves last month.
That's thier arch enemy!
I know right?
Was it by a long shot?
No, not by much.
Man, there killing the competition.
Each game, more and more.
I've got faith in my boys!
Roar, the Lions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what the most watched TV event is?
Is it the Academy Awards?
Good guess, but no.
How about the Presidential Inauguration?
That isn't it, either.
OK, I give up. What is it?
Superbowl.
Oh! I see where that makes sense.
According to NBC, the 8 most watched television broadcasts in history have all been Superbowl games.
I'm not a big football fan, but I always catch that game.
I do, too and it's usually at someone's house who's having a Superbowl party.
I had one once, but there was just too much yelling going on during the game.
I know. Some people just totally get into it/
Well, the games are usually good and I really like a lot of the commercials they show.
True. They also always have such great halftime shows.
That's one of the main reasons I watch the game. So many good performers have performed there.
I though Lady Gaga was so good last year.
Me, too. Then I also liked Beyonce the year before.
The halftime shows have had a lot of huge stars.
They sure have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so excited for football to start!
Oh, when does is start this year?
Week one is September 10th. I cannot wait!
Me either! Is there a special, early game before that first Sunday of games.
I think so, let me check.
Yeah, it looks like the Chiefs play the Patriots that Thursday before.
Oh, that should be a good game, I think!
Weren't the Chiefs good a few years ago?
I think they were really good in 2013.
I think that's right. They lost the wildcard game that year, but they were really good during the regular season.
How did they do last year?
They made it to the playoffs, but then the lost to the Steelers.
The Steelers always so good though.
Yeah, they are very consistent.
Who is your favorite team?
I am a big Bengals fan, actually.
Oh, that is interesting! I haven't met a lot of Bengals fans.
Yeah my whole family roots for them.
How did they do last year?
They went 6-9-1 so lots of room for improvement this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite football player of all time.
I have alot.
I have a few but Manning is my favorite.
Which one?
Peyton.
I like him
His brother is good too but I like Peyton more.
Who is his brother.
Eli Manning.
who does he play for.
he plays for the Giants.
oh yeah.
They both are good.
Their dad played too right.
Correct. Great family.
They were born for football,
Cannot wait to see if he comes back to coach.
really?
I heard rumors but not sure.
yeah you never know if you just hear rumors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite team?
The Cowboys
I hate the cowboys.
Then who is your favorite team?
I like the Packers.
Who is your favorite player currently?
I like Aaron Rogers?
He's ok
Who is your favorite?
Dak Prescott...But i'm also a big fan of Odell Beckham Jr.
He's cool
Yeah. His team is really good.
I think they're ok.
Who is the worst team to you?
I hate the Cleveland Browns.
Yeah, they're not very good.
I don't like the Jacksonville jaguars either.
They're not so bad to me.
Well i wish your team lots of luck.
Yours too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any other countries that are interested in Football like we are in the USA?
I don't really think there are. Everyone else seems to like soccer.
Huh. It must be an American thing.
I guess so. Do you like football?
I do. I'm not the biggest fan in the world, but I like to watch sometimes.
What's your favorite team?
The 49ers. I grew up in San Francisco, so I watched them a lot as a kid.
That's funny, I grew up near there too, but I always liked the Raiders.
It's probably cooler to be a Raiders fan.
Why?
I don't know. It just gives off that image to me.
Huh. Well that makes me happy I guess.
Think they stand a chance at winning?
Now that we have Marshawn Lynch, I think it's possible.
Hmm. Well, I guess it'll be an exciting season then.
I know that I'll be following it closely.
Are you going to have any watch parties or anything?
I was thinking about it. Maybe for the first game?
You should! I'd come.
Great, then I will then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where are you watching the upcoming game?
I actually bought a ticket for because I am exited and I think its worth watching live at the stadium.
Did you read about the drama on social media between Wilkerson and Pugh?
Yes, but do you think it is just a media publicity thing to attract attention?
I think Wilkerson made a funny joke but Pugh took it too far.
I agree but also I think Pugh took it way to serious.
So do you think the Giants will lead this season?
I am expecting interesting season regardless who wins or looses.
Who will be the opening start for this game?
I believe the starter will be Mccown this time.
Do you think we will witness any injuries in this game?
I really hope that everyone will stay safe and act emotional.
We want drama free game and not like the one with Pugh and Wilkerson.
Pugh is really good in what he does but he jumps way too fast and too strong.
Do you think I still have a chance in getting a ticket?
I am not sure. You know how many people are expecting this game.
Everyone is anticipating Jenkis game and the final results.
The results will be positive for the team.
Who else do you think contributs for the good game they play?
It is hard to tell between so many great players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the history of the Pittsburg Steelers?
That's a pretty interesting story!
Please tell me.
The founder of the team was Art Rooney.
When was that?
In 1921, Art Rooney started the Hope-Harvey football team. It was a semi-professional team in Pittsburg.
What happened next?
The team got a sponsorship from Loeffler's Electronic Store. That store had a popular product called the Majestic radio.
So, the team became the Majestic Radios?
Yes, and that agreement lasted until 1931.
What happened in 1931?
In order to promote his brother's political aspirations, Art Rooney changed the name of the team to the J. P. Rooneys.
Wow, these are strange names!
I agree, but it was a pretty common practice during the early days of the NFL.
How did they become the Steelers?
Art Rooney was determined to get into the NFL. He first succeeded as the Pittsburg Pirates.
When did that team change their name?
They became the Steelers in 1940.
That's an amazing story!
It is. But, even more amazing, is that there was a time when Art Rooney was a football player, coach, and manager all at once!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Superbowl XXXVI on replay last night.
The first time the Pats one?
Yes, first time.
They were in it twice before, right?
Yes, Superbowl XX and XXXI, both losses.
To Chicago and Green Bay.
Blown out 46-10 in XX.
Different in XXXVI.
I thought they were going to get blown out by the Rams.
The Greatest Show on Turf.
The score was close, luckily.
3-0 in the first quarter.
14-3 Pats by the half.
Due to an interception and a fumble.
17-3 by the end of the third quarter.
I thought the Pats had a chance then.
It would have been 23-3 after a fumble to the Pats, but it was called back.
Then the Rams tied it.
Leading to the great last second Vinateri field goal.
And Brady became the M.V.P.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you hear about some of the Falcon players?
No what happened? Good news or bad news?
It was great news.
Well what did they do?
Devonta Freeman, Marquand Manuel, and a few other players organized a free football and cheerleading camp.
That is awesome! I love to see players giving back to the community.
Yeah that is great to hear some great news for a change.
Wow that is amazing. Where exactly is the camp located.
It is located in Miami, FL. Its near Devonta Freeman's old neighborhood where he grew up.
It must of been very rewarding for him to do that.
Yeah that's cool he was able to set up a camp seeing that he is having some contract issues with the Falcons.
Yeah I hope he can settle soon because he really is a valuable player.
He is underpaid and he wants more money. I don't blame him.
Do you think he will sign the current contract or become free agent?
I think there is some negotating going on behind the scenes.
I hope he decides to stay on the Falcons
I understand where he is coming from. His loyalty is very strong for the Falcons
Yeah because he is will to negotiate his contract and not just leave.
Overall he is a great player and him creating this camp in his old neighbor hood shows that he is a great person.
I totally agree with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many more Superbowls do you think Brady can win?
I bet he has one more in him.
You think so?
Well, Manning and Elway went out on top. I see Brady doing it too.
Yea, he's the greatest ever.
Better than Montana?
I think so.
Wonder what Drew Bledsoe thinks?
Haha, old Drew never got his job back.
He was a really good QB too.
Yea, but nothing like Brady.
I can't argue with that.
Maybe because his balls were deflated?
Oh that's just wrong.
I know, that deflategate was a waste of money.
I had hoped the team would keep Mallett as a backup.
The guy from Arkansas?
`Yea, I think he had a ton of potential.
I did too.
Can't doubt the coach though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know Peyton Manning?
Doesn't he play in the NFL?
Yes.
What about him?
I got to meet him the other day at a gas station.
You get his autograph?
Sure did.
What team does he play for?
Broncos, he played for the colts for over a decade though.
That's a long time, he must be getting old now.
Yeah, he probably only has a couple years left to play.
You a fan of his?
I'm a big fan.
Why?
My home town is Indianapolis, so I watched him play all the time.
That makes sense.
Do you have a favorite team?
The patriots.
Why?
I'm a fan of Tom Bradys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Has the NFL ever had any competition?
What do you mean by competition?
I mean have there been rival leagues.
Yes, there has been.
What league?
The American Football League existed in the 1960s.
What happened to it?
It merged with the NFL in 1969.
Were there others?
Yes, there were at least three others.
What were those leagues called?
Interestingly, they had the same name.
You mean there have been four rivals to the NFL called the "American Football League"?
Yes, but they all rivaled the NFL at different times.
When?
These rival leagues started in 1926, 1936, 1940, and 1960, respectfully.
Wow, it seems like there has always been a rival league!
Yes, and there will probably always be a rival league. It keeps the NFL on its toes.
Give me another example.
Vince McMahon started the XFL in 2001. It lasted only one season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
We're supposed to talk about the NFL?
Yeah that's right.
Do you have a team that you like?
I like the Jets and the Panthers.
Oh two teams that's interesting.
One is where I grew up and the other is where I live now.
Is it hard to watch games for both?
Sometimes.
What do you mean?
Sometimes they will play at the same time and sometimes the coverage will be blacked out.
Oh, yeah I hate it when that happens.
It's really annoying.
They do it to make you by the packages.
Yeah and the NFL network.
Yeah that's right.
What about you, do you have a team that you go for?
No not really, I just watch a few games here and there.
Gotcha.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Very good. What was Walter Payton's nickname?
Sweetness!
You on a roll. What was Doug Flutie's nickname?

Willie Gault and I think he started his own line of clothing didn't he?
What was Mike Singlegtary and his wife nicknames?
Salt and Pepper.
What's the name of the dance the 1985 Superbowl winners created?
The Chicago Bears Superbowl Shuffle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So i went on the Bucs webpage to look up what season tickets cost.
Are you serious? Why would you do that?
I was curious what they cost now.
So, what was the prices?
I don't know, it was taking so long to load, i walked away from it.
Guess they don't really need the money.
I guess not.
Does NFL run their page or do they run it?
They do i believe.
I bet the NFL Has some kind of standard for all of the trwms websites.
Possibly, it's all marketing.
And reputation is part of that.
True.
I want to go to a game this year, i was just curious how much season tix were.
It's not cheap.
There was a link for "interest free financing" fortickets.
You are kidding me.
Nope, you can buy a used car or season tickets.
That's crazy.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This fall is the new NFL season are you ready?
Yes, I am so excited !
Who are your favorite teams?
My favorite teams are the Eagles and the Packers.
Mine too ! I think the Packers have a great shot at winning again/.
Tom Brady was awesome last year ! but we need new winners.
It would be awesome to see the eagles step it up this year.
Jason Peters looks like he might have a good year.
I am not too sure about him I like Evan Mathis.
Yeah he is good but what about Demarco Murray?
He has had some awesome touch downs in the past.
I have been watching him. I am not sure how far he can take them this year though.
He has a forty million dollar deal on his plate he should do well.
Fletcher Cox is in his fourth season this year he is due.
He is a great defensive lineman but can he really deliver?
I would really love to see them win something it feels like a long time now.
Yes, they need to get back to there roots and take one home.
What about graham that dude is in top notch shape now.
He could be another to watch this season.
I am so excited.  I can't wait for the season to begin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best quarterback in the NFL?
I would have to say that it is probably Tom Brady if I had to pick one.
Who was the other quarterback you would pick if you could pick two.
It would definitely be Aaron Rodgers.
What do you think about the Patriots?
I think they are actually pretty amazing. It's a very well run franchise.
What do you think about the accusations that they cheat all the time.
I think that most teams probably do.
What do you think is so amazing about them?
It really seems like they can turn about any NFL player into a star.
That does seem true. Randy Moss really did resurect his career when he went there.
Do you think they will win the Super Bowl again?
If I had to bet on one team to do it, it would be them. They are just so good on both sides of the ball.
Who do you think has the best chance of knocking them off?
It really is hard to pick any one team. To me they are the only team that really stands out.
I would probably say that Atlanta might be able to beat them if given another chance.
It's possible. Matt Ryan seems to still be underrated despite the fact he won the MVP.
I think he sure seems to have more weapons than what he used to to work with.
Julio Jones is probably the best receiver in the NFL right now.
I would say it's between him, Antonio Brown, and O'dell Becham Jr.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to hear some really weird facts about the NFL and it's players?
Sure? Why do you ask?
I want to write a list for  a blog and I want to run them by some one else for interest factor.
Ok I can do that for you.
Tim Tebow was on MTV in high school.
Interesting but kind of boring.
Okay let me try another one. Joe Montana pointed out the actor John Candy before Super Bowl XX111 winning drive.
That's a better one for sure!
This one is pretty fun. Rob Gronkowski has in own cereal brand...Gronk Flakes.
You can add Flutie Flakes for Doug Flutie.
Thanks I will. How about this. Larry Izzo of New England Patriots once took a poop while on the sideline and got the game ball for his trouble because he did it without anybody noticing.
What???? That is awful!
n the NFL playoff between Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears of 1988, the fog was so thick that the players weren’t even able to see the sidelines and the fans couldn’t see the field. The refs had to announce what happened after every play.
Wow how awful for everyone!  Iam surprised some people didn't want their money back.
You know Neon Deion? Deion Sanders is the only player to hit a major league home run and score a touchdown in the NFL in the same week (1989 season). Sanders is also the only man to play in both a Super Bowl and a World Series.
Mr Super athlete!
NFL legend, Herschel Walker has multiple personalities. He doesn’t remember receiving the Heisman Trophy because one of his other personalities was in charge at that time.
That is so sad! I remember watching  him being interviewed and he talked about that.
Well that's just a few I have picked out so far. What do you think?
I think it's a good start and NFL fans would enjoy the weird facts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your predictions for the Steelers in this year's NFL season?
I think they have a pretty good chance this season.
Why do you think so?
The injury situation seems to have cleared up and we don't have major players with suspensions.
Was that an issue last season?
Yes. Not having LeVeon Bell for the first four games probably made a difference down the stretch.
How so?
Well had we won more of the first four games we would not have been in the Wild Card and would have more time to rest in the playoffs.
DO you sense the mood of the team is better?
I do especially for Antonio Brown now that they gave him a generous contract.
What do you think of the rule changes with the goal posts?
It is really going to make the game interesting.
How so?
With a goal post not so wide, I guess windy day kicking could make or break a game more often
Do you think that rule will stay?
It depends on the relative skill of the kickers.
What did you think of the comments that kickers are not really a part of the team?
I found the comments totally ridiculous.
Okay....who are you predicting to meet in the Superbowl?
Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers. It will be epic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know Dallas is no 2 in term,s of rushing offense.
All Zeke and Dak. Dak has more rushing yards than his no 2 running back who is Morris.
Yep. Can't believe BUffalo is no 1 in rushing. LeSean McCoy and Tyrod Taylor.
And Tyrod has more rushing yards than HIS no 2 running back.
Dual threat QB in the NFL isn't always the best
NFL is so evenly matched, it doesn't really matter that much.
What, having a dual threat QB doesn't matter? or that rushing doesn't matter?
Dual threat QBs
Right, gotcha.
WEird thign is that the Pats are no 7 in rushing yards, and no 5 in rushing TDs, no 4 in passsing yards, and no 6 in passing TDs
How can they be the superbowl champions? it makes no sense.
it has to do with the points per game. That's the best stat.
Patruiots'  points per game is still only no 3. No 1 is Atlanta.
Funny thing is New Orleans. They're no 2, but haven't been to the Superbowl in years.
2009 was the last time.
And Drew brees is one of the better QBs in the league
And they do put up the numbers.
No 2 in points/game,  no 1 in yards/game, no 1 in passing yards/game, no 16 in rushing yards/game...
Maybe that's the key. Rushing yards per game
Not really, because top rushing team are Buffalo. Dallas, Tenessee, San Francisco.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey can you believe it's already almost football season again?
Yeah it seems like it just finished yesterday.
How do you think the Redskins are going to do this year?
I don't know, the NFC East looks tough.
Yeah, but you never really know.
The Giants just got Brandon Marshall. On top of Odell? That WR group is nasty.
Sure, but Eli? Does he have anything left in the tank?
He just needs to be adequate. Just throw the ball up and those WRs will come down with it.
Yeah, but the Redskins defense looks improved.
I don't know man, the Redskins? Really?
Kirk Cousins is for real.
Are they even going to pay him? And who is he going to throw to? Didn't DeSean Jackson go to the Bucs?
Yeah, true. And Pierre Garcon went to San Francisco.
See? That team will be lucky to win six games.
I guess you're right. Plus Dallas has Dak and Zeke.
And Philly.
And Philly.
You think Carson Wentz is for real?
I think so. They also got that WR from Chicago this offseason. What was his name again?
Jeffrey?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think New York has a chance this year?
The Giants?  I don't really see much happening for them?
Why not?
This organization seems stuck in a rut with the same culture.
Yes, they don't seem to change a lot.
That might be a good thing clubs that keep changing a lot do not seem to go far.
The giants do have quite a few Super Bowl championships.
The formula is consistency.
Yes, but it seems like they are in a rut most of the time.
Then all of the sudden they make an unexpected run and take it all.
Eli Manning needs a good team around him.
He is getting older now and he was always inconsistent.
If you pressure him he is like a deer in the headlights.
But if he has the team around him he can do well.
He's been playing a lot longer then I would have thought.
I thought he was an average player.
The giants have stuck with him and given him loads of money.
All their money is in a few players.
I think that is what is keeping them mediocre.
You need a team not all the money in a mediocre aging quarterback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how many games does Clevelan win this year?
One...and that's being conservative...
I think they will win five..
I'd like to have some what you are smoking, dude
The schedul look to be in their fave though.
First of all, no quarterback, just a bunch of bums.
True, very true. Forgot about that
And their best receiver is playing for the Redskins
I remember that...and Gordon stays in trouble
Exactly. Cannot leave the drugs alone
Didn't he get traded?
Unfortunately, no
Well maybe he gets it together this year
Keep dreaming, he'll find a way to mess up
He has wasted three three years of his career on drugs
He will never get it back either
It's a shame. You imagine what we'd do if we had his talents?
Yup. Everyday...
So three wins then?
Hahahahaha...one. like I said
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the chances of the Buffalo Bills are?
I like what they are doing long term, but this is a rebuiliding year.
I don't know, I like their talent and depth, I think they are a darkhorse.
At least rex is gone, but i think they are one year away.
Mcdermott is for real, the team had playoff talent with terrible coaching, with a good coach, I think that will be enough.
If not at least we have that extra first rounder and can get a franchise QB.
I dont think we need that, Taylor is good, and we have two good young QB's behind them.
That is another issue, if taylor gets hurt or doesnt work out, Jones or Peterman are not experienced enough.
McCoy is always good, the the reciever group is better form top to bottom if Watkins stays healthy
I agree Zay Jones was a steal in the draft.
The only real hole on offense is right tackle and Dawkins may fill that void.
Defense is a bigger concern.
They arent the same since 2014 but I still like the talent.
Front 7 is good if Dareus donest get in trouble again.
Ill admit, the defenisve backs worry me.
Yeah me too, especially safety, after hyde, it is very thin.
Hopefully everyone stays healthy, going to training camp?
I wont be able to make it, but I think I can get to a couple regaular season games.
Me too, I always try to catch one, maybe we can go to one together.
Yeah that would be a good idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the interview with Tom Brady about how long he wants to play in the NFL?
No I didn't see that.  What did he say?
He wants to play until he is 45.  He is in great shape.
Wow, that is a long career.
I bet he will break a lot of records if he plays that long.
I would think so.  I bet Brett Favre and Peyton Manning are nervous!
Well they should be.  Brady is still in top shape!
What did you think of their Super Bowl comeback?
It was amazing.  I think Atlanta just ran out of gas.
Yes the Patriots played fast in the 2nd half and the Falcons got gassed.
Is there a certain NFL team that you like?
I really like the Indianapolis Colts.
I like Andrew Luck.  He's been a bit inconsistent as of late though.
Yes he might have been battling some injuries the last few seasons.
Well the Colts defense hasn't helped him either.
They have been historically bad.  Even when Manning was there they just tried and outscored the other team.
I bet Manning would have won a few more Super Bowls with a better defense.
Yes for sure.  They had no problem scoring.
The rules seem to favor the offenses in the NFL too so that doesn't help when your defense is bad.
That is so true.  Defenders have to be very cautious with how they tackle and push other players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the greatest tight ends in the NFL?
Well Gronkowski has a shot, but he's always injured.
Yes, his problem is health.
I think he will stay healthy this year.
Why do you think that?
I believe the Patriots will use him more sparingly.
That might be true - they should save him for the playoffs.
I agree - I think he will have another dominant year, though.
What do you think of Aaron Hernandez?
His story is a damn shame.
He could have been one of the greats.
He had everything going for him, and was even on The Patriots.
He had such potential, and already had a great season under his belt.
He would have been dominant with Brady.
Yes, this is true. Do you like Tony Gonzalez?
He might be the greatest receiving tight end ever.
I think so too - he has so much yardage!
I think he may have the most yardage of any tight end ever.
I think this is true, he will be missed.
I surely miss him - such a great player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about THE DALLAS COWBOYS.
They celebrated their 75th anniversary in 1994.
That was when they started the double star on the jersey.
They just use that jersey for special occasions.
Their THANKSGIVING DAY jersey is always different.
They use their original style from 1960.
The first stadium they used was the Cotton Bowl.
It was made in 1932.
They used to play in Texas Stadium.
It cost $35 million.
It opened in 1971.
It holds 65,000 people.
The Cowboys train in Frisco Texas.
They used to always train in Texas or California.
In 1960 they trained in Oregon.
In 1961 they trained in Minnesota.
The Cowboys rivalry with the Redskins is cool to watch.
It is called one of the greatest in sports.
They have a strong rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles.
Someone was accused of putting a bounty on a kicker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so ready for football to start.  Let's pretend we are doing a mock fantasy football draft.   You go first, we'll predict how the first round plays out.
David Johnson - 2,000 total yards, 25 touchdowns.
Nice Pick - Nest would be Laveon Bell - He gets tons of yardage and will have 12 touchdowns.
After that, I would pick Ezekiel Elliott.  He's running behind one of the best lines in the league.  He will do even better than last year.
I would pick Antonio Brown. He's a lock for 100+ catches, 1,300 yards, and 10 touchdowns
You have to go with Odell Beckham Jr. next, he's finished in the top 5 in wide receiver scoring every year he's been in the league.
Julio is a safe next pick.  Guaranteed yards and catches.
After Jones, I would pick Melvin Gordon.  He's improved and is the workhorse back in San Diego.
Next, would be Lasean McCoy.  He's getting older, but I think he should get 1,500 yards and 12 touchdowns.
Mike Evans - young star who keeps improving.  This year he tops 100 catches.
AJ Green - Very underappreciated.  If healthy, he'll be in the top 5 scoring.
Nice Pick.  I would take Jordy Nelson next.  He has one of the best QB's throwing to him.  He's a lock for 12 touchdowns.
Speaking of underrated, next would be TY Hilton.  He's been in the top 24 scoring for wide receivers every year he's been in the league.
I like it.  I'm going to take Aaron Rodgers next.  Might be early for a quarterback, but he is great.
Even though he gets hurt a lot, It's time Rob Gronkowski goes off the board.  He gives you production like a wide receiver does.  besides, it's fun to say Gronk!
I like Jordan Howard next. He's the only weapon that Chicago has.  He's a lock to get 25+ touches a week.
I really like Leaonard Fournette for Jacksonville, tons of touches.
How about Devonta Freeman for Atlanta.  I think he gets at least 12 touchdowns and 1300 yards.
Nice, who else could go next?
Tom Brady, Jay Ajayi, Michael Thomas, Dez Bryant, Drew Brees.  There's so many great players, it's hard to decide.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know when the football season starts?
I think it's in the beginning of September.
I can't wait. It's been too long! I think I'll go and see them at training.
Who?
Cardinals. They train in Flagstaff.
It will be nice to get out of the heat and watch them practice.
I want to get some autographs too. Especially from David Johnson.
He is the new Running back, right?
Yeah, he is an awesome player! He's fast and smart player, too.
It's good that they have a good offensive players.
Now we will have to start looking for a quarterback and wide receivers, too, though.
I guess you are right. I'm thinking Palmer and Fitz will play another season or two at the most...
My thoughts exactly!
We'll see how they do at draft.
Ugh, I get so intense watching the draft...it's nerve wrecking...
Don't worry, Cards is a great team.
I know and I love the way they play. Not dirty like some other team...
Yeah, I really like Bruce Arian, too. He is a great coach.
Let's hope we beat the Seahawks!
Oh, I know! I hope so, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think are the most famous players in the NFL?
Hm, I think that's pretty subjective.
What do you mean, why?
Well, some might know more than others.
And I guess the definition of "famous" isn't concrete.
Exactly, but I tell you which players I know the best.
Agreed, I saw number one is Tom Brady.
Definetely, I was going to say the same.
All of the Patriots are pretty well known though.
Yeah, but Brady is married to Giselle Bunchen and she's a model.
Oh, yeah, a power couple.
I think Dante Culpepper is pretty well known.
Who is that?
He was a quaterback for the Minnesota Vikings.
Ahhh, okay, you like that team don't you?
Yeah, Dante lives in my city!
Wow, that's amazing!
Yeah, he's super nice.
Well those two are pretty good famous football players.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about football
Great i love it
Me too
Who do you like
Steelers
Oh okay
What about you
The raiders
They are pretty good
Ive always been a fan
Thats how i am with the steelers
Glad to meet a diehard fan
Likewise
I watch every game i can
Me too
I have the sunday ticket
I do too
Its great
It is
Worth the money
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch that Raiders vs. Saints game last night?
No, what happened.
Man, you missed a good one.
What was the score?
Raiders won 35 to 34.
Oh no. I fell asleep before the game came on.
Yep, Derek Carr had a good game.
How many yards did Carr pass for?
He passed for 319 yards.
What did Drew Brees do?
Brees played well himself. He had 423 passing yards.
How many rushing yards did the Raiders get?
I think it was about 167 yards.
What about the Saints? How many rush yards did they get?
The Saints had 88 rush yards.
Wow, they could barely run the football.
Yep, Oakland's rush defense shut them down.
Oh well, I guess the Saints will have better luck next time.
Maybe so but they will have to make some adjustments.
Yep, I expect the Saints head coach to review the film and learn from any mistakes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So for today's lesson in NFL history we are starting out with the Chicago Bears.
I didn't know that we were going to have one but go ahead please.
The record for most team fumbles in a season belongs to the 1938 Chicago Bears. They fumbled 56 times.
Ouch that had to hurt!
The record for the fewest team fumbles in a season belongs to the 1959 Cleveland Browns. They only fumbled the ball eight times.
Don't get side tracked on the Browns.
Okay how about this one.Brian Urlacher of the Bears carries a ping pong paddle in his car.
That's pretty random and a bit boring.
Following Thanksgiving, Super Bowl Sunday is the largest food consumption day in the United States. how's that?
Much better and never would have suspected that to be true.
I like this one.Raiders running back Justin Fargas is the son of actor Antonio Fargas, famous for playing Huggy Bear on the series Starsky and Hutch.
I love it! Huggy Bears kid!
In 1948, the Rams became the first team to have a helmet insignia. The  Ram horns were hand-painted onto the helmets by the team’s halfback, Fred Gehrke.
That is some dedication. I wonder if there is a picture of one somewhere?
okay back to some more Bears facts....hah I can do it too
Give me the bear facts.ha ha ha
Out of 50 games played on Monday Night Football, the Chicago Bears have lost 34.
That's a sad Bear fact.
Defensive end Corey Sears has a tradition of eating a whole lemon before each game.
Sour puss!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to get to go to any home games this season?
Yep, I got tickets for two home games this year.
Who's going to be playing?
First game is against Green Bay and the second game is against the Saints.
Both should be good.
Yeah, they are both in December so it will be real cold at Giant Stadium.
I know, I've been there before when it was pretty darn cold.  Went one time when the Giants were playing the Eagles.  It was like 10 degrees.
I've been there in the snow before.  Great games.  That's when they play the best too.
Well, hopefully the season will be going good for the Giants then.
I think it will be.  Their defense is supposed to be real good and if their offense can hold up.
Yeah, well that game against Green Bay will be important I bet.  It's going to be late in the season isn't it.
Uh huh, week 15.  It might decide a home field advantage or something.
Playoff atmosphere.
You ever go to a playoff game?
No, never a chance at getting tickets for that.
Better chance going to a road playoff game then getting in for a Giant playoff game that's for sure.
Hey, that'd be kind of fun.  A road trip.  Where would you want to go see the Giants win?
Dallas.
Yeah, for the NFC Championship.
Or Philly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Faithful?
Do you mean the San Francisco 49ers?
Yep.
I am mostly disappointed with them since Jim Harbaugh left.
He is a great coach.
The biggest mistake the 49ers ever made was letting him go.
I hear that he just couldn't get along with the owner, Jeb.
Instead of being successful at the collegiate level, he could still be leading the 49ers to victory.
What do you think about Colin Kaepernick?
I think Jim is the only person who could bring out his full potential.
Do you think he will ever work in the NFL again?
It's hard to say with all the controversy surrounding him.
Changing his stance on the National Anthem thing made him look flakely.
He has decided to stand now to would increase his chances of getting hired.
I am all for him standing up for what he believes in; he just needs to be consistent.
I agree with you on that.
Do you think Tom Brady is greater than Joe Montana?
I think Tom Brady is finally edging Joe out of the top spot.
They are both great quarterbacks.
I hope the 49ers get a great one soon to help them back to the championship again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Todd Marinovich?
Yeah he was the USC quarterback that the Raiders drafted
He had a lot of drug problems
Yeah he had a promising career ahead of him
Well hes in the news lately
I heard he got arrested naked recently
Yeah he wants to comeback and play football
OK he has to be almost fifty
Yeah he is I dont think it will happen
I thought he was going to be a great quarterback in the NFL.
Outside of just the drug problem a ton of quarterbacks bust.
Yeah you know who else busted hard?
JaMarcus Russell.
Yes I was going to say him.
Its hard to project the position going from the college sport to the pro one.
Why do you think that is?
Because the games are so different
You still just throw the pigskin
But the spread of the players
I still think its basic elements in both sports.
XXXXXXXXXXX
dude. patriots got an easy schedule this season.
yeah? who they got?
they play the chiefs in week one, saints week two, and houston week three.
okay, that sounds like three and zero.
then they got carolina, tampa bay, jets, then the falcons.
another four wins.
then they got the chargers, denver, and then oakland.
sounds like they could start off at ten and oh.
i know right.
but dude, i can't stand the patriots.
naw. you just hate because all they do is win.
i mean like give someone else a chance.
everybody does have a chance. right now everyone is undefeated.
yeah, a thirty two team tie for first place.
man you stupid.
i know right.
who you like this season?
i don't know really. i always root for my eagles though.
that goes without saying. do you think they will make some noise?
i hope so. they done missed the playoffs like two straight seasons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that hockey is the most brutal sport around?
No, I would have to say that would be football far and way.
I would tend to agree with you about that.
Even the biggest hockey fan would have to admit that I would Imagine.
You would think so! The NFL may be the hardest hitting league in the world.
I would agree with you there, that may be why everyone loves the NFL like they do!
Even though it is highly entertaining, do you think it is safe?
I feel like the NFL has gone out of their way to ensure player safety.
They have even changed a lot of the rules for safety purposes, correct?
Yes they have changed the game quite a bit over the years due to safety concerns.
What if a player directly hits another player in the head while leading with the crown of his helmet?
That would be called targeting, and the player would then be automatically ejected.
Wow, that has to be difficult for referees to call in the heat of the moment.
The good thing about it is, those type of plays are review-able.
Do you personally like the rule changes that the NFL has instituted?
I like that they are making the game safer for the athletes, but there are some negative aspects of the rule changes as well.
What kind of negative aspects?
Well, I understand players not being able to lead with their helmets. However, often times players are punished for hits that are not dangerous at all.
It seems they are making the game much harder on defensive players.
Exactly! Many players in the NFL even complain about not knowing how to tackle anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really miss getting to watch Troy Polamalu
he was a total raging beast on the field
at 5'10" and 207 lbs, he has got to be one of the scarier strong safeties to have ever played in the NFL
no doubt, but the funny thing is, is how pretty his hair was
didn't he do hair commercials?
I believe that he did
I'm sure offenses have nightmares about those luscious locks even to this day
you would be scared too if you thought that a severe hit highlight of you would end up in a conditioner commercial
ha ha ha touche!
who do you think is the big defensive player is going to be next season
I'd say Von Miller at outside linebacker for the broncos has a shot
he is a class act
yeah, he is also hilarious. did you see that commercial where he imitates a Justin Beiber video?
Oh man. that was hilarious, i did a total double take
did you know he gave every player in the AFC west a gift last year?
I didn't know that, what did he give them.
he gave them a personalized bottle of wine, and a thank you note
wow, what a nice guy
in fact, Von Miller autographed each bottle as well
they need more players like him in the NFL!
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey are you excited for the new season?
I sure am it is going to be good,who are you rooting for this year?
I am hoping the Cowboys go far really
oh why is that?
well because they got a young team mostly and did well last season.
That is true Dak is a great Quarterback for them.
He sure is,who are you going to root for?
I really like Green Bay
Oh really why is that?
Well usually just followed them all my life especially recently and just been a life fan
That is pretty cool, but isn't Aaron Rodgers getting pretty rusty?
I donno about that last year he did really well
that is true he really came back in the playoffs.
He really did ,like they were losing to the falcons and he brought them back.
He is really one of the best players in the NFL.
He really is and I would say the best QB that there ever was.
I really do not know about that man
Why is that? who do you think is better
I donno just that there have been many great QB's in the NFL
And Aaron Rodgers is the best there ever was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the NFC North?
The packers always seem to be the best team
Aaron Rodgers is the GOAT
No way, elway was better and has more rings
What do rings prove Eli manning has 2 and he's not even Elite
The NFC East will be awesome this year
The cowboys should still be running away with it I think
Eagles picked up some good WRS for wentz though
Plus the redskins..
What was the deal with their GM
Apparently he was a drinker
Like that should disqualify someone from working in the National Football League
Anyways back to the north I'm looking to get a bet down
I'll give you the field against the packers
That's a bet
Anything else you like?
Rams under 6 wins
Those guys are gonna be terrible!
Poor Todd gurley
At least he gets all the Carl's Jr. he can eat
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ready for the season?
Yes! Waiting to see who takes over in the NFC North
DO you think the Bears have a chance after trading everything for a QB?
Not really, the guy isn't that good.
Are you worred about the packers?
as long as Rodgers plays, yes
I think the Vikings can take the Packers this year
They will have the defense to do it
Yea, and I think the Lions are still out
Without CJ, I think Stafford is still a bit lost
And they cant play defense
No, that doesnt help.
Who do you think will win it all this year?
I think the patriots are still contenders.
Brady is probably the best QB of all time. SO I wouldnt be surprised
I hope he DOESNT win just to give others a chance
Yea, gets boring to watch after a while
Are you going to a preseason game?
I hope to, not sure which one
Let me know and I'll try to join you
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about that Andy Dalton?
Andy Dalton???? He's the worst quarterback in the NFL!!
But his stats are always in the top 5% of the league!
He's never even won a playoff game!  He's 0 for 6 in the playoffs!
What about Phillip Rivers? He's great, but chokes in the playoffs, too.
Yeah, but he's never had a great team behind him.
Neither has Dalton. Paul Brown won't spend the money to surround him with quality players.
That's true. Paul Brown is the Bengals biggest problem.
If the Bengals were owned by Art Rooney, or Bob Kraft, they would have won 6 Super Bowls with Dalton.
Maybe, but they don't have Bill Belichek, or Mike Tomlin, either.
What would Belichek, and Tomlin do differently for the Bengals?
They're both great coaches that can motivate the team in crunch time.
So how could the Bengals change their future?
They could hire a better general manager, than Katy Blackburn, and get rid of family nepotism.
I think that is what is holding them back. Bill Walsh would have been a good pick. Too bad he's dead
Haha, yeah. But on another note, they could triple the scouting staff.
They are trying to operate this team on a 1980's type of staff.
I've heard their scouting staff is so small, they can't evaluate all the college prospects out there.
That's true. Their front office needs a major overhaul.
It's high time to shake up this team leadership. I would like to see them win a playoff
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the NFL to start.
yes. I am walways ready.
I like it just some of the rules.
They change them every year,
What do you think about the coaches?
I think they are good.
SOme could be tougher.
yeah I think some coaches lack discipline.
If they had more of it the teams would be tougher
I agree.
Chuck Pagano has promised to be tougher on his team this year.
I think the Colts would do so much better if he was.
He is a good coach.
I agree he just lacks on giving discipline.
I cannot wait to see him get tougher.
it will help the team in a whole if he does.
I think it will make them better if he does.
I agree.
He needs to be tough on the whole team.
That would be amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been keeping up with the NFL in the off season?
Yes! What do you think about the Cowboys' new offensive tackle?
The kid from Arkansas? Skipper?
Yes! He is like 6′ 10″ I think? He is really going to help out our offensive line.
I think so too. I also like Taco Charlton from Michigan.
Was he our first draft pick?
Yes I think so. He is a defensive end I think.
We need him on defense for sure...we need something!
True! But, I think with Prescott at quarterback and the new picks, we will be a contender this year.
I don't know. We still are pretty young.
Yeah, but look at what Prescott did last year.
Yeah, but I still think the Falcons or the Steelers are going to take it this year.
Roethlisberger is getting some age on him though.
They got Dobbs from Tennessee.
He is so young though, and I really don't see him making an impact for a while.
True. I just don't know if Roethlisberger has another championship left in him.
Look at Brady though.
Yes, but that is Tom Brady though. He is a freak of nature.
Maybe, but I still think the Steelers will take it this year.
I guess we will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what team do you support in the NFL?
I love my Redskins, I've been a fan since birth!
The Redskins?! Their front office is a total wreck.
I know, its honestly embarrassing. But I believe in Kirk!
Thats fair, Kirk Cousins is a great QB. Completely honestly though, I much prefer Matt Ryan.
Are you a falcons fan?
Yes I am a proud Falcons supporter!
That Superbowl must have been really rough, I thought you guys were going to win it all.
I know, I was really hurt. But this season I just have a good feeling about them.
They will be playing with a chip on their shoulder thats for sure.
Agreed. Plus they have a new stadium, which should give them some motivation as well.
Yeah it looks really nice! And they have the lowest beer prices in the country which is awesome.
I bought tickets to go to the new stadium when the Falcons play the Saints.
That will be a great game! Drew Brees is getting older but hes still awesome. He just needs more pieces around him.
Thats very true, he cant carry the team anymore like he used to.
Yeah, but I think the best QB in the league will be Brady again this year.
He's the ageless wonder, I don't know how he does it.
He might honestly be the greatest QB of all time.
I don't doubt that, although I'd through in an argument for Dan Marino.
The man never won a superbowl but I can see why you are saying that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man what's up.
Not much here.  What about you?
I'm OK.  So you been watching football lately?
I used to watch it.  My whole family watched it when I was growing up.
Oh yeah?  What was your team?
New York Jets.
Hey me too!  Did you grow up in New York?
Close.  Jersey.
How close to the city were you?
Very close...we lived not far from the Meadowlands.
Where they buried Jimmy Hoffa, right?
Yeah, right, right!  That is the story anyway.
Or was it the GW Bridge pilings?
I don't know man.
You go to any games?
Not too many, we grew up kind of poor.
Yeah yeah I hear that.
So anyway, you know, I have not watched football too much lately.
Oh yeah?  Why is that?
I don't know man.  Just not too into it these days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who don't you like?
For me that's easy.........the Pats. and the 9'ers.
Tell me why.
I don't like the 9'ers specifically because I grew up a Bengals fan.
What does that have to do with anything?
Well the Bengals played in 2 Superbowls in the 80's and lost to the 49'ers both times on basically the last play of the game.
That sucks.
Yes it sucks, that's the main reason I despise the 49'ers.
The Bengals had some good teams back in the 80's.
Yes they did. Kenny Anderson and Boomer Esiason were great quarterbacks.
So why the Patriots?
First off they cheat, Belichick cheats and Brady is just too darn smug.
That Hernandez dude used to play for them also.
Yes, and look what he did to others and himself.
Yeah, but you can't put that on the organization.
Why not? Even his teammates in college at Florida were afraid of him, stayed away from him.
He was a really bad dude wasn't he?
Yes, the dude murdered at least two people.
Belichick is one heck of a good coach though isn't he? He wins.
I will not say that because they have been caught cheating on multiple occasions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the Chargers game last night?
No. I had to work. Who did they play?
The Chargers.
Did they lose again?
Yes. And I was rooting for their team too
Who the Chargers or the Lions?
The Chargers.It seems like the last two games they played were losses.
Alot of people watch these games out because they like the sport
And you ?
I like the sport and certain teams
So your saying that even if a losing team is playing they watch because they just like football?
That's it.
Also these teams get alot of hype and publicity to sell tickets
I know they really hype some of these players up but when you watch them play its not that good.
Yeah I the 49er are just a little overhyped I should say
I agree. Their players aren't that good- the rookies either
Some of the players should just retire
They wait until they are late 40's early 50's or so
So is that why they are called the 49ers?
Yeah, their players are 49 years old. Ha ha ha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about the Giants?
Eli Manning is a has been. He's not gonna get any more Super Bowls.
Tom Brady will, though.
Sure, but I think other teams will have a chance.
Like, who?
Maybe, the Broncos. Even without Peyton, they are still strong with Damarius Thomas, and other strong players.
Maybe, the Falcons, too?
Nahh, maybe the Packers, or the Ravens. They have a better chance.
What about the Lions?
Nope
The Texans?
No chance
The Jets?
Nope. They're like the Giants, but worse.
What about the 49ers?
Ehhh, they might. But they had their good runs.
What about some of the players?
Uhhhh, like who?
Uhhhh, Jessica something?
Ohh, Jessica Namath's cute in that fur, with her father, Joe Namath. A former pro player, too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think of Carson Wentz?
The Eagles new Player??
Yea.
He had a good rookie season in 2016.
Yea but he is a great quarterback.
He was the second choice pick in the draft this year.
Yea and he makes 450000 a year!
That is almost a half million dollars for playing a game!
Sure, and he is only 24 years old.
You have to be a good player to do that.
I can't wait to see how he does this year.
I hope he helps the Eagles along.
What does he do during his off season.
He is a hunter.
Relly, well I guess they do a lot of that in North Dakota.
Is that where he is from?
Yes.
He is a good player.
I hope he has a great season.
Me too, that would be an experience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the Superbowl this year?
It is awful early to start guessing that?
But if you had to pick.
I think the Patriots are always in the running.
I really hope they are not this year.
It has gotten old seeing them there year after year.
I think the Raiders might actually have a chance.
I think they will be good this year.
They have been improving lately.
Not to mention Lynch.
Of course that is a great addition.
He is a great running back.
He is.  I would put him in a class with Adrian Pederson.
Definitely.
I think the Skittles commercials are funny.
He must really like that candy.
He must.
It will be fun to see how they do.
As long as it is not the Pats I guess.
Exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you know about the first Super Bowl?
I know it was Green Bay Packers against the Kansas City Chiefs and that the Packers won.
Do you know where it was played?
In Los Angeles.
It was the only Super Bowl game ever played that wasn't sold out.
I wonder why.
Because journalists were telling people to go other places to watch it on TV because ticket prices were so high.
How much were they?
Twelve dollars.
Twelve dollars? That's nothing.
Not these days, but back then, it was a lot of money.
Wasn't the first Super Bowl played back sometime in the 1960s?
1967. Also, for the only time in Super Bowl history, the game was aired on two different networks.
Why is that?
NBC had the rights to the AFL games and CBS had the rights to the NFL.
I think it would be fun to watch the game and see how different things were back then.
It would be, but you can't.
Why not?
Neither network saved the footage.
That sucks. At least that doesn't happen today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of the QB the Bears drafted?
Well, they gave up a lot to trade up to the 2nd draft position to get him.
True. He better be great, or that was a mistake.
A great QB really makes all the difference in your team's chances though.
So true. You've got to roll the dice and hope you get lucky.
Yeah I believe QB is the hardest position to scout. More busts there than any position.
Still, this guy has quite an arm.
He'll need it at Soldier Field in the winter time. The wind there can be awful to throw against.
I heard a lot about his accuracy. I really hope it's true.
No kidding. Cutler had a great arm, but he wasn't accurate, and it killed them.
It killed me watching it!
Yeah, you see short throws from the best QBs  that are in the perfect position leading the receiver go for huge plays all the time.
Most of them are so fast that if you don't make them stop or lunge just to catch it, they can gobble up huge chunks of real estate in a flash.
God, I'd give anything to see that on a regular basis here.
That's the dream!
So we'll see how he turns out. Hope springs eternal!
Yeah, he's got some definite pluses.
But lots of college experience isn't one of them.
Yep, that's the risk. The claim they don't expect him to play much this year as he learns.
That's the plan. But they're just one big hit on the veteran starter Glennon away from having a whole new plan. It's be trial by fire.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to get season tickets for the Bengals this year?
No, I don't think they are going to do that well this year.
I agree, they lack the depth ofr roster I am looking.
I will be watching how the Raiders do moving down to Las Vegas then.
Yeah I wonder how the season tickets there must be.
From what I heard they are pretty reasonable.
Do you think the Raiders will do well being in the new stadium?
I don't know, I'm sure that will affect them.
Yeah, but that might get them more exciting to turn things around.
The fans also will be some of the same but many new ones, so they ought to play well to get those new fans.
They really need to be looking for a franchise player.
Yeah,  I can't remember the last Raider franchise player since Charles.
Teams like the Colts, or the Giants, or the Patriots have just had such consistency in their franchise players.
That's true, they have had the chance to build the team around those guys.
Maybe Oakland could get it through a trade, but really they just need to have another good draft year.
I can't remember who they got the past few years, but that probably tells you something about the quality.
Yeah, the drafts have not been too good recently.
I'm hoping there will be some more star players to begin replacing some of the older guys in the league.
I totally agree, I feel like we have had Brady, Manning and Roethlisberger for forever.
Yeah, maybe this will be the year when the younger talents pick up the torch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel so bad for Seahawk fans, man.
Why's that?
Because of Marshawn Lynch.
Yeah I know, it really sucks he retired.
No, he's going to the raiders.
What? Since when?
Since last week. Are you living under a rock?
I guess so, I've just been so busy.
Well, I just feel bad for the fans. I'm glad I'm not a Seahawks fan.
You shouldn't feel bad for them, you should feel bad for me.
What? why?
Because now I have to be a Raiders fan.
You're such a band-wagoner.
You're just a hater.
I thought you were a Patriots fan?
I am.
But now you're a Raiders fan?
Yes sir.
How does that even work?
I have enough love for all the teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, you think Dak Prescott is gonna win MVP this year?
No, I think the Cowboys are gonna be really disappointed with him.
Why? That guys is awesome!
No he's not, I mean he's ok.
So what are you talking about.
Dak did really good last year because the Cowboys running game was so strong.
I mean, he still was a good quarterback, and could be again?
Yeah but he caught teams by surprise.  They'll be more prepared this year.
I don't know how you can say that.
I mean, running quarterbacks like him, Kaeparnick, they almost always have a glaring weakness.
So why didn't other teams exploit it?
IT just takes time, you have to get film on them first.
I guess I see what you're saying.
Yeah, that's what makes guys like Cam Newton, or Aaron Rodgers so tough.
Yeah they don't really have as much of a passing weakness.
Right, but they can still run with the best of em.
Well I still think the Cowboys are gonna, 'run' away with the NFC!
Well you are a mindless, simple drone of the NFL hype machine.
Whatever bro, you just wish you had this good of a team.
The bucs are going all the way this year, I promise you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the greatest Super Bowl Championship team of all time?
Easy, Da Bears
You mean the 1985 Chicago Bears?
Yep, that's them
Why do you say that?
Think about the players on that team: Payton, McMahon, The Fridge
Oh yeah, and Richard Dent and Mike Singletary
Yeah, them too.
Yeah, Walter Payton was a pretty spectacular running back
Yeah, he was awesome. One of the greatest.
Did you know he never scored a touchdown in the super bowl?
Yeah, I heard about that. One of Mike Ditka's biggest regrets.
Yeah, he played for years on horrible Bears teams and finally won one at the end of his career.
Whatever happened to him?
He passed away. Was sick with some liver disease.
Man, that's too bad.
Yeah, he was only 45 when he passed
Wow, that young!
Yeah, RIP Sweetness
Yes, RIP Sweetness.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you watch the playoffs
Yeah man they were so good
I cant believe the Falcons blew that lead
It was so fun to watch, I can't stand the falcons
I really wish Julio Jones would come to the Panthers
I know, he would be so good to pair up with Cam
How do you feel about the draft picks?
I really love the first 2 picks
Same, I think this will help our offense tremendously
I think if Shula gets his act together we can be the top offense again like 2015
I'm a little concerned about our secondary
I'm not, I think we have vast improvements over last year
Hopefully, it was probably the worst we've ever had
Yes Ill agree to that
How do you see the NFC playing out this year
Hmm I think Seattle and Carolina will get the byes
Really, I think New York will put up a fight this year
I can definitely see that too
I could also see Arizona giving Seattle a run for that division
Definitely looks to be an interesting season
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is going to be the story line of the NFL this season?
It's who can compete with the Patriots of course.
I think you are right.  What teams are going to be good this year.
The NFL is always so hard to predict because of the salary cap.
True, but do you have any teams in mind that could break through.
Probably the Texans and Titans.
Really the Titans?
They weren' too far off last year and they added some nice pieces.
I do like their Quarter Back.
Marcue Marriota is really good for the Titans.
They also play in a division that is getting better.
Yes, Houston and Indianapolis should be better, and even the Jaguars.
Have you ever been to a Titans game?
No I haven't but I want to.
I went to a game in San Diego last year between the Chargers and Raiders.
I bet that was fun.
It was great and the Raiders fans always travel well.
Those Raiders fans where some crazy costumes.
I know some of them are scarey looking!
Well their team mascot is a Pirate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It won't be long until the NFL season starts.
I know! I can't wait.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Green Bay Packers.
I used to follow the Packers.  I liked them when Favre was the quarterback.
Aaron Rodgers is a really good quarterback too.
Is he as good as Favre was?
I think he may even be better!
Really?  My favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys.
How long have you liked them?
I started following them when Roger Staubach was the quarterback.
That was 40 years ago!
I know.  I went to a couple of games when Troy Aikman was the quarterback.
Have you been to the new stadium, Jerry's World?
No.  I haven't been to any games recently.
I went to a game last season.  That place is huge!
What do you think of Dak Prescott?
He's pretty good!  I like him.
I hate to say it, but if Tony Romo hadn't got hurt, we would never have known how good he is.
True.  I bet Prescott has a great season this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like the NFL?
Yeah, I love it. Why?
I'm putting together a watching party for week one, you wanna come?
Yeah that'd be great
Who do you think is gonna win?
Probably the Patriots, they always win
You never know, the Chiefs have given them trouble in the past
Yeah, but last time the Chiefs beat the Patriots the Patriots went all the way
I know, but I think the Chiefs defense is really solid
Yeah, but the Patriots picked up Brandin Cooks
I know, he has unreal speed
Him and Brady together could be dangerous
As good as Brady and Moss?
Nobody will ever be as good as Brady and Moss
Not even Montana and Rice?
They were good, but a different type of good. Brady and Moss was just so explosive
Cooks is explosive too
Yeah, but I don't think anybody will match Moss's athleticism
How tall was he?
6'4", not to mention the 4.25 40 time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the crazy money going around the NFL right now?
Yeh, can you believe how much that one quarterback got?
Yes, that was crazy for sure. Quite a lot of cash.
Something like $150 million right?
Close, he's going to get $125 million for 5 years.
That's insane, who is he?
It's Derek Carr of the Raiders.
I don't really know him that well.
He had a good season last year and they want to hang on to him.
Still, that sounds like a lot of money for a guy who's not a household name.
It actually makes him the highest paid NFL player ever.
You're kidding me right now?
No, I'm not, it's the most money per year ever.
So he makes more than Tom Brady?
At the current time yes.
That makes no sense to me at all.
Well, with the Raiders moving in to Las Vegas they need a great team and good leader.
So they're moving from Oakland to Vegas? Are you serious?
I agree, they move around more than a Bedouin tribe it seems like.
Well, it should be interesting at least. The Raiders in Vegas, that's a trip.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Buccaneers?
I think they are an okay team.
I like them when Warren Sapp was on the team.
How long ago was that?
That was in the 90's - he was a lot of fun to watch.
I remember those games!
He was always so animated.
They used to be coached by Tony Dungy, right?
Yes, he was a great coach.
Yes, he really was. Did he take them to the super bowl?
No that was Jon Gruden.
That's right!
But is was actually Tony Dungy's team that was put in place.
He was probably mostly responsible for that Super Bowl trip.
I think so.
He was such a good play caller!
I can't believe they ever let Dungy go.
I know - the whole town was in disbelief.
It was a sad time.
They were a fun team to watch under Dungy and Gruden.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you an NFL fan?
Yes, have you heard about the financial classes they allow the rookies to take.
I have. It is really nice of the NFL to offer and encourage such things.
The players get out of college and have huge salaries. They need help managing it.
It also promotes a positive image on the NFL.
Other sports should learn from the NFL.
The NFL also promotes community causes.
I heard Drew Brees supports Play 60.
What is that?
It is a movement to encourage kids to play outside. The NFL supports it.
That is wonderful. I know the NFL has been promoting safety of its players.
That reflects really well on them.
It has come at the expense of upsetting some fans because they have enacted some rule changes.
Player safety must come first. The game is still entertaining for thr fans.
The NFL also promotes Breast Cancer Awareness.
I have seen the players wear pink cleats and gloves.
It is a great cause.
I like how the NFL supports vets. I love watching America's game of the week.
I like seeing former President Bush do the coin toss for the NFL games.
I have never seen that happen. That sounds cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
Yes,it's going to be fun.
Right,if you're a New England fan.
I know what you mean there.
They should be right at the top again.
They are every year.
It doesn't seem to matter who they get or who they lose.
It's a great organization with a great coach.
And a great quarterback.
That's for sure.
Do you think Tom Brady will ever slow down?
He's showing no signs of it.
He says he wants to play ten more years.
Won't he be around fifty?
He will be fifty I believe.
If anyone can he can.
I suppose your right.
It's possible Denver or the chiefs can make a run at them.
If things break right,yes.
I know New England will certainly be in the hunt again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the Philadelphia Eagles , don't you?
Sure do, I went to a couple of their games last year.
Where at?
Philly.
What do you ;think of Jordan Hicks?
He is a really good player.
I think so too.
Have you ever gone to any of their games??
Yes, several but many many years ago.
I bet the tickets were a lot cheaper then.
I guess but seemed like a lot even back then.
I love NFL football but ticket prices are insane.
Yea but you can actually see the game better from your couch.
You can but the excietment of going to the game is great!!
And the tailgating.
Definitely.
Have you ever seen the Cowboys play?
Only once against the Eagles
Who won?
The Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how do you think your Raiders are going to do this upcoming season?
I think they should be able to make the playoffs again
Me too, assuming everyone stays healthy
Yeah, I hope Marshawn will still live up to the Beast Mode name
He should as he's representing his home town now
That's true!
But we'll see if he still has it from the first few games
As long as the O-Line holds up, it should be good
Carr signed a massive contract extension, do you think it was worth it?
I do, he's still young and is still constantly improving
I think he's a very smart QB and has the potential to be great
They have a great wide receivver corp too
They did pick up Cordarrelle Patterson, I think that's a great addition
Yup, Carr should pick up right where he left off before his injury last year
So what's your record prediciton for them this season?
I think they'll go 11-5
I'm guessing around there too
The Chiefs will probably battle with them for the division lead
Good prediciton, I gotta go. I'll catch you later!
Ok, see you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What NFL team do you like?
I guess you could say I'm a Bears fan.
Chicago? Is that where you're from?
Yes.
When was the last time they won?
The last year they won was in 1986.
That was before I can remember. Was it with Ditka as the coach?
Yes. The town went nuts.
Really? How so?
I remember hearing about the Lane Tech High School marching band being ransacked during the parade.
Who were the players?
I remember a few of them. Walter Payton was the star running back and William "the refrigerator" Perry was their main offensive lineman.
Why did they call him the refrigerator?
Basically, he was a big heavy-set dude, so people equated his size and weight with a refrigerator.
He didn't ahve the typical ripped physique people associate with athletes?
No, he was quite the opposite of that.
I see. Who was the quarterback?
It was Jim McMahon.
Was there a famous song about the Bears?
Yes. It was called "The Superbowl Shuffle."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well another NFL season is getting ready to start.
Thank goodness, I hate when there is no football on tv!
I hear you there.
How do you think this year is going to go?
Well, unfortunately I think the Patriots are probably going to have another good year.
I am so tired of them. Tom Brady is getting old though.
He is, but I think he still has a couple of good years.
True, and with the players around him I think that they will still do well.
Well I am pulling for the Packers do well.
I think that they have a pretty good chance.
They have both Jordy Nelson and Aaron Rogers. They are always very good.
True. I think they will have a good season.
Who do you think will be the worst team in the league this year?
I think it is probably not to different from who it has been the last few years.
I think I saw a prediction that the 49ers and the Browns will be the worst.
Yeah, that is not suprising.
Wouldn't it be great if they suprised everyone and one of them made it to the Super Bowl?
It would certainly turn heads.
And a lot of fantasy footballers would be upset.
True. Lets just hope the Patriots don't go to the Super Bowl again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the five best receivers in the NFL next year?
I would say Antonio Brown would be the top receiver, followed by Odell Beckham Jr., Julio Jones, Dez Bryant, and Rob Gronkowski.
Does Rob Gronkowski count? He's a tight end.
You just said receiver. You didn't specify that they had to be a wide receiver.
Fair enough. While Rob Gronkowski is a great player and a lock to make the Hall of Fame after he retires, he's too injury prone for me to put in my top five.
That's a fair criticism. However, he's Tom Brady's best offensive weapon by far and his size and speed can't be matched by any defender.
True, but he was injured for the second half of last season and the Patriots were still able to win the Super Bowl without him.
I think that had more to do with the football genius of Bill Belichick coupled with Tom Brady's excellence at quarterback.
That's an entirely different subject for debate. Back to the original question though, do you really think that Dez Bryant is currently a top five receiver?
Without hesitation. He's one of the best physical wide receivers in the league and helps open up the running game for Dallas.
While that might be true, he is a terrible route runner that has too much trouble getting seperation from defenders.
That's not ideal, but he is still able to catch the ball in spite of double coverage on key plays.
I think his record is mixed on that front. Furthermore, I feel that his inability to control his emotions causes him to be a distraction, which hurts his team.
You say emotional, I say passionate. You probably wouldn't put Odell Beckham Jr. in your top five I guess.
I would in terms of talent. However, I would put him in the fourth or fifth position.
Really? His speed and catching range are not just the best in the NFL right now, but potentially all time great.
I agree that he is among the best receivers, if not the best receiver, in terms of talent. However, he's too temperamental, especially in his match ups against Josh Norman.
I believe that in his last match up against Josh Norman, Norman was the one with all the penalties and getting overly emotional.
True, but this is following too match ups where Norman obviously got the better of Beckham Jr. Furthermore, the boat trip before the Green Bay playoff game last year demonstrated poor decision making on his part and hurt his team.
The criticism surrounding that boat trip is ridiculous. The trip was during the Giants day off and Odell Beckham Jr. did not miss any of the required practices that week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, you ready for the NFL season to start?
Yeah dude, not having any games going on is driving me crazy.
Haha I feel you, the year is more fun when the games are going.
Yeah, for sure. I hope we see a game as exciting as the super bowl again this year.
Yeah that game was one for the archives. Can't believe the Broncos pulled it off like they did.
It was awesome!
Speaking of which, did you get a chance to watch the draft?
Nah sadly not this year, had some business so I couldn't really pay attention to it.
Understandable, I didn't really catch it while it was happening but I did read that it was the most attended draft in history.
Wow really? That's pretty crazy.
Yeah this was the first time it was held outside so people could gather around, apparently there was over 200,000 people there.
Crazy!
Wonder if the Bears will turn it around this year...
Don't hold your breath man, they did really terrible in 2016.
Yeah I know, but they are still my home team so I have to root for them.
You don't have to root for anyone, besides you're in California now, pick a new team to root for.
Have you seen the teams around here? I will just stick with the Bears.
Fair enough haha, forgot how bad things were over there. Man you sure know how to live around some stinkers.
Very funny. We all anyway man I gotta go do some stuff I will catch you this saturday.
Yeah for sure, see you there man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the Washington Redskins?
Decent team with a strong heritage
Have they won any Super Bowls?
Oh sure, back in 82, 87 and 91
Oh so it's been awhile
Yeah, they had Joe Gibbs as a coach and he was legendary
What have they done recently?
They've made the play-offs a number of times recently, but haven't gone far.
Who's their current QB?
Kirk Cousins. He's okay, but not Tom Brady.
Oh man, Brady is the greatest.
Yeah, he's pretty great.
Who are the Redskins' biggest rivals?
I would say the Cowboys, Eagles and Giants.
Oh, they all play in the same division right?
Yes, the NFC East
Some call it the NFC Least
Well, depends on the year.
Well, hopefully they'll be competitive this year.
Yeah, agree. Always good to have a good NFC East division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really think the seahawks could make it if they only got some better defense and coaching.
I can see why the better coaching could help, but their still good.
Tom Brady definitely has at least another 2-3 playing years in him.
What would say if Gronk didn't come back?
I love Gronk, but I think with the leading running backs and tightend support, it won't be a huge loss.
The Seahawks hopefully will make the right draft picks this year.
I know the Patriots are going to keep Chris Hogan, he's amazing.
What are your thoughts on Edelmann?
Julian Edelmann is another great example of Patriots power.
Who do you think is going to make it at least into the playoffs?
I'd say it will end up being, Pats, Steelers, Buccaneers and the Colts this year.
So basically the Pats versus who in the Superbowl?
I am hoping it will be the Pats versus the Colts.
Yea I'm not a big Colts fan either.
I've never been a fan, so I'd love to see the Pats beat them.
Who else other than the Pats, do you like?
If the Pats aren't going to get in, I'd love to see the Buccaneers win it.
Big possibility for them to make it.
Well this has been a nice talk, best of luck to your Seahawks.
Yes thank you and the same to your Pats.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Ey man
You watching this
What
The game on ESPN
Nah I'm watching FOX
Why
Is it not obvious
What is
Fox is the home of the NFL
And?
They have it best
Nah
How come
ESPNs highlights are better
Are they?
For sure
How
Better commentary
Perhaps
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the top five NFL teams will be this year?
That is a hard question.
It is.  I would start with the returning Superbowl champs.
The Patriots?
Yup.
Then I would include the Falcons.
I would agree with that.
Then who do you think number three would be?
I think the Raiders.
I would agree with that.  Seems odd.
Why do you think it is odd.
Because they had not been good for many years.
Yes, they had a rough stretch.
Then what about the number four team.
I think I would go with the Steelers.
That is probably a good choice.
And at five?
I would say Packers.
Yup, Green Bay has been good for a long time.
Rogers helps them with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's almost football season!
Yeah, it's coming in a couple of months.
Do you think the Texan's are going to do it this year?
I don't know, but they should have a good team.
Yes they do. They got a new quarterback.
That's what I heard. Have you seen him.
I've seen him on TV, but just talking. I haven't seen him play.
He's a rookie just out of college, right?
Yeah, but they say he's pretty good.
Is Savage still on the team?
I think so. He'll probably be backup quarterback.
I think that they have to try out for starter position.
Oh yeah. That's what the preseason games are for.
I never watch those.
Yeah, me neither.
When do the real games start?
The first Thursday after Labor day.
When is the Texan's first real game?
The first Sunday after Labor Day, against the Jaguars.
I hate the Jaguars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you think the best running backs are going to be next year
I have my eye on the new kid, Ezekiel Elliott
oh definitely. he had a crazy season last year. 1,631 yards and 15 TDs. that is like beyond all star quality
I'm also going to be watching Jordan Howard
He looks really good as well. He only found the end zone 6 times, but he did rush for 1,300+ yards. he is going to do good things for the bears if he stays with them
Of course I will also have my eye on Le'Veon Bell
I don't know what it is about him, but I really don't like his running style
He puts up huge numbers. he ranked in the top 5 last year, and only played three quarters of the season
he does put up big numbers, but the way he stutter steps and hits the hole so delayed is annoying. I think defenses will eventually figure him out
no way. he is a rock star. so long as he stays healthy he will have a great year
personally, i'm going to watching how DeMarco Murray continues to perform
I like Tennessee's quarterback, Mariota. If he continues to perform, that will only make Murray more dangerous
He's already extremely dangerous. he averaged 80 yards a game last year with about 4.4 yards per carry
no doubt. do you think LeGarrette Blount will repeat his performance again. surpisingly that old workhorse lead the league in TDs for RBs at 18!
holy cow. i didn't know he had that many. he really adjusted to New England well.
i personally think he might be a little too old to put up those kinds of numbers again
David Johnson will probably have another stellar year
I had him in one of my fantasy leagues. he just racked up points for me week after week
you are so luck. he had 16 TDs last year. that got you a ton of points
I know. I could count on him almost every week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the greatest defensive player in the league?
I think that JJ Watt definitely has a claim to that spot.
It's a shame, though, because his teams haven't been great recently.
Yes, hopefully the Texans will be solid this year.
Seems like they are bad every year.
They had a decent run when they had Arian Foster.
I am sad that Foster has since retired.
I know, he used to be so great.
The problem is that running backs have short lifespans.
Unfortunately, that is the reality in the NFL.
I really miss Calvin Johnson.
Me too, he was the best.
Megatron - as they say - was probably my favorite receiver.
Mine too, he had such grace on the field.
What do you think of Andre Johnson?
The man is great, but unfortunately just retired.
Yes, him and Fitzgerald were great for so long.
Hopefully Fitz won't retire for a while.
I know! I love him so much.
As a Cardinals fan, I do, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, NFL Training Camp starts in a few weeks.
I know right how great is that?
It's awesome as everything else is very boring this season.
I know what you mean, NFL and football is where it is at!
So how do you think the Lions will do this year?
They have a chance only if Stafford stays healthy.
Exactly! He is the key virtually to everything.
He needs to step it up and take this team to the next level.
Yes he does. He has talent around him.
Very true, but as Lions fans we are always skeptical.
I know that but since Quinn took over we have improved the roster.
Very true, as he is doing what many GM's never have here.
Millen was a disaster, so nice to finally have a guy in place who seems to know what he is doing.
He really does thus far.
Well if Stafford and the offense pick it up this year, I think the defense should be better with off season acquistions.
Defense is better, we are faster, and hopefully make the playoffs.
Playoffs? We better get there and win a game....It's only been 20 years
Isn't that crazy how long its been?
Yep, but hopefully we turn it around. Go Lions!
Forward down the Field LOL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Jacob, what's going today with the watch party?
You mean the football watch party?
Yeah man the Panther game, I have to see them win!
Who are they playing today?
They are playing the Saints, I have to invest time into this team with their new rookie.
Who is the new rookie?
You haven't heard they picked up Christian McCaffrey?
I hadn't heard, what position does he play?
He is a swift running back and I can see him doing well the blitz play offense of the Panths.
I wish you guys luck in that one, come over soon.
Thanks man, will do!
Don't forget that there are some Saints fans that might show up.
It is alright, I will just keep my jersey at home to remain neutral.
You won't be neutral when the Saints score!
How dare you say that, I got faith in the rookie squad.
Carolina is solid but the Saints run the East now!
Nobody runs Tom Brady, but they are definitely good with Drew.
It should be a good matchup.
Indeed, see you soon?
Yep, I'll bring the chips!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best player in the NFL?
Tom Brady
I think many people think that
Yeah, he proved it last year though
Do you think he is a Hall of Famer?
Of course
I hope he has a good year this year
Me too
Do you think they will win it again?
The Patriots?
Yes
I think they will
It is so hard to repeat though
It is, but if anyone can do it they can
Who do you think they will play?
The Packers
Now they have a good squad
They do and they are due for a title
Didn't they win it a few years ago?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love it!  Season ticket holder!
Aw, you are so lucky!
Yea, man!  A present
For Christmas?
Nah, my birthday
Oh cool!  Which team?
The Bills
Oh, that's a waste!
Hey!...
I mean they can't ever win many games
But this year will be different!
Bills fans say that every season
No but really!
Dude, it will never change
I have faith!
At least someone does!
You gotta!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which part of the country do you think has the best NFL teams?
I think the East zone does.
You're from the East coast so you may be a bit biased.
What zone do you think is better than the East?
The West has some big teams such as the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers.
Yes, but notice those teams are only teams in the National Football Conference. The east coast has great teams in both the National Football Conference and the American Football Conference
Go on, I'm waiting to hear you name them
First of all, we've got one of the biggest rivalries: the New York Jets and the New England Patriots.
True, both of them are great. Are those in the American Football Conference?
Yes, they are. So is the Dolphins who count as an East zone team, not a south team.
I actually assumed they were South.
Yes, I've heard people make that mistake.
What teams are on the East National Football Conference?
The Giants, the DC Redskins, the Philly Eagles, and another team people often think are the south - the Dallas Cowboys.
That's a lot of star power. Maybe you're right that the East has the best teams.
In your defense, the west is really catching up. There are many teams all of the country in fact that are far more high quality now than they used to be back in the day.
Yes of course, top teams change over time.
Just like the players, no team can be on top of their game forever.
I don't care who's on top. I am dedicated fan and I will always support the same team I always have since I was a kid.
Same here. That's called NFL loyalty!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish it was September already.
I know! I miss the NFL.
It's weird on Sundays without football.
Very true, I find it hard to occupy my time.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Giants.
Do you think Eli is over the hill?
Eh, he's close but he's got plenty of weapons this year.
Very true. I really like the addition of Brandon Marshall.
Add in OBJ and they have a lot of weapons.
Eagles defense will be tough though.
True, but I don't know if there offense can keep up the pace.
Yeah, but you gotta think that the offense will take a step forward this year.
I'm honestly not so sure.
Well, the Cowboys are definitely the favorite.
They deserve to be the preseason favorite, but there are questions.
Like what?
Whether Dax Prescott can take a further step this year.
He looked good last year.
But that was last year and he is still young and facing a lot of pressure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for preseason.
Yea, preseason is my teams only chance.
Wow, who is your team?
I've been a Bears fan forever.
Yea, looking like a rough year.
I think they will miss the quarterback from Vanderbilt.
I miss the days of Ditka.
Yea, the Superbowl Shuffle is awesome!
I miss William Perry.
I wish Walter Payton was still playing.
I miss that defense!
Oh my God, Wilbur Marshall was a beast.
Mike Singletary could hit too!
Jim McMahon was a character.
Little did we know Jim Harbaugh was even worse!
I still think Payton should have gotten a touchdown in the Superbowl instead of giving it to Perry.
I bet they regret that decision.
Did you know Payton's brother played in the NFL?
No I didn't!
Eddie Payton played for the Lions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are your favorite wide receivers in the NFL?
Of all time or right now?
Of all time.
Jerry Rice is the best ever.
I 100% agree with you. Jerry Rice is number one.
I feel like they based that movie Rudy after him.
Why do you say that?
Because Jerry Rice was ignored by NFL scouts for being too small.
I never heard about that, that's interesting.
Yea. But, anyway, next is Don Hutson.
Who is that?
He played waaay back in the day. Like in the 1940s.
Oh come on, there's no way he could hang with toay's players.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
Ok, fair enough, who else? Nobody from 100 years ago.
Haha ok then, Randy Moss.
Now that's more like it, that guy moved at the speed of light.
Yea, I really miss seeing him on the field.
Hey we all get old.
Ain't that the truth.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I prefer more manly sports
Really?  How about I pretend I didn't hear that?
Haha!  Lighten up bro!
No, but what is more manly than football?
MMA
That's arguable.
True.  But you vs one other guy until one of you gives up or is knocked out is super manly.
I'll agree.
So you think I'm right?
Nah. I mean football has a group of guys plowing through each other to get a ball to the other end of the court by almost any means necessary.
Well when you spin it like that...
Nah, there is no "spin".
I think there is a spin, but you also have a point.
So football we can agree is more manly then?
Nah
I guess we'll have to disagree then
Indeed
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think of the Raiders chances this year?
I think they will definitely be a lot better and keep improving.
You think they will have enough to make a run at the championship?
I don't think they have all the pieces quite yet.
I think with Derek Carr signed to a new deal we are really investing into the future.
Yeah, Carr is a stud, but do you think he is worth all of that money?
I think he got 5 years for $125 million, which is a lot, but he is a rising star.
That makes him the highest paid player in the league by average salary, lot of pressure on his shoulders.
It is for sure, but he's shown so far that he handles the pressure, brings a winning attitude, and he's a leader.
No doubt. I think he has it all to be able to lead the team to a ring, but like I said they need more pieces.
I think adding Marshawn Lynch is huge.
Yeah, he is one of the greatest ever for sure, his age is a bit worrying though.
Yeah he is getting old, but I think the one season break will have he refreshed and ready to go for this year.
Yeah he will need to take the pressure off of Carr a bit and score some touchdowns.
I think this is exactly what the team needed and we can really start making a statement in the league now.
I think the team is coming together quite nicely, got the quarterback, running back, and receivers. Now that offensive line and defense needs work.
We made some great picks in the draft for the defense and as you said everything else is pretty solid.
I think if Carr keeps improving and making the team better then they will be a contender in no time.
I sure hope so. It's been a tough time being a Raider fan the last decade.
I hear you. I just can't wait for the season to start!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, here's my pick for the Superbowl this year.  Dallas vs New England.
All right.  I think it will be Carolina vs Denver.
Oh, so you don't think the Patriots will make it this year.
I hope not.  I'm getting pretty tired of the New England Cheaters winning year after year.
Yeah, that's what happens when you win all the time.  I remember when my cowboys used to get that kind of hate.
Some of us still hate on them pretty good.
That's for sure.  All teams that dominate a decade get that.  The Steelers in the '70's and 9ers in the '80's.
And part of the '90's too.
Yeah, and the boys in the '90's.  But as America's team they have had haters for a long time.
Like the Raiders.  You either love em' or hate em'
Well, who wins the AFC East then?
Oh, I think that New England will win that.  I think they will lose to Denver in the AFC Championship.
Ok, What about the AFC north?
I think Pittsburgh and Big Ben got another year in them and will take the division.
And the South.
I don't think any team from there is going anywhere but Tennessee will probably win that division.
Probably.  Who is going to give Denver trouble in the West?
Probably KC.
Not the Raiders?
I'm not even sure they will be called the Raiders, much less them being much of a challenge for a while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oakland is going to enjoy having Marshawn lynch this season though.
Yea, its too bad that he left Seattle, but Oakland is getting a gamer.
Aren't you tired of Marshawn Lynch?
What you do you mean?
You know? His whole act.
Like not talking to the media? Retiring and coming back?
Yea, that stuff. It all has gotten old.
You know, I have thought about that too. His teammates seem to like him though.
Yea, I agree. His act is just getting really old.
Well, old or not he is gonna be an excellent addition to the raiders.
Yea, we already know they have their QB and lead receiver.
Yea, the only weak point on the offense last year was RB. They solved that.
I agree! Now they just have to keep their guys healthy and win.
Yea, it should finally be that time for the Raiders. They have a needed a QB to build around for a long time.
Yea, well they have one now in Carr. Or at least they paid him like one.
Yea, you are definitely right. That man got paid.
Lots of money he did. Lots of money.
Well, we'll see how that translates to the field.
Yea, well if Carr stays healthy, they are a superbowl contender.
I agree, but that seems to be a big if with him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, we have an open spot in our fantasy football league this year, do you want in?
Thanks, but I'm already in three long running leagues. Who do you like at QB this year?
I like Russell Wilson. He needs to take it all the way this year.
I'm sticking with Brady, I think he has one more ring in him.
In fantasy, I don't like to waste early picks on QB's. I also like Derek Carr and Jameis Winston.
QB's can rack up a lot of points, I also like Matt Ryan. What position do you pick first?
Wide outs, they also rack up a lot of points and most people don't look at them in the first rounds.
Good point. Who is on top of your list list year.
Mike Evans and Antonio Brown. The Steelers are def contenders this year.
Yeah, I like Odell and Julio Jones. Atlanta is looking good too.
You're right about that. They have a great D and Ryan has some awesome targets.
I'm so stoked it's almost time for preseason.  Who is your favorite running back.
I like Le'Veon Bell. Another reason why the Steelers could take home a ring.
I wish the Pats had more strength on the ground.
James White had better stay healthy.
We'll see. They got a couple of good backs in the draft.
What do you think of Dak Presscot?
I'm no Cowboys fan but that guy looks good.
I think Prescott could be a real diamond in the rough.
Tyrod Taylor is also going to turn some heads this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What teams do you think could compete for an NFL title this season?
I don't know, but the AFC looks stronger to me, overall.
As strong as the Cowboys were last year, that seems harsh.
That's fair. And I can't rule out the Packers or Seahawks.
But you still prefer the AFC?
Yeah, you start with the Patriots, then have perennially competitive teams like Baltimore and Pittsburgh, and add in Oakland.
You really think Baltimore has a shot?
Sure, Flacco is still decent, and I never underestimate Ozzie Newsome.
Flacco needs weapons, and those wide receivers are pretty thin.
Right now, yeah, but a lot rests on how Breshad Perriman develops.
Is he even starting this year?
I think he's penciled into an outside spot, with Maclin in the slot.
How do they make up for losing Dennis Pitta, though?
Well, a lot of that will have to come from Maclin and Perriman.
I don't even know who their tight end is, now.
They have a few B-listers, Ben Watson and Maxx Williams, for example.
That's not a very inspiring list.
I'm hoping they'll take a look at Gary Barnidge.
Why didn't the Browns bring him back, anyway?
I assume they just want a roster full of young guys for the rebuild.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the best rookie this year?
I don't know any of them.
Have you heard of Leonard Fournette?
Yes I have.
He played for LSU.
Is he a running back?
Yup.  A very good one.
Who will he be playing for?
He is with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
That is a bummer.
Yeah.  The team isn't great but he will be fun to watch.
I normally wouldn't watch a Jaguar game.
Me either, but because of him I might watch a couple.
I will wait to see it on the highlight reels.
That is one way to go about it.
Are there any other good rookies this year?
Dalvin Cook should be pretty good to.
Don't know who that is.
He is a running back that went to Minnesota.
I will keep the name in mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what is your favorite sport if you had to pick one?
I would have to say football would probably be my choice.
Do you like the NFL or college football the best?
I love them both, but I would pick the NFL.
I love the NFL myself. My family and I are huge New York Giant fans.
Cool, I love the Broncos personally.
I bet you sure enjoyed that run that Peyton Manning took them on, huh?
I love Peyton and I am really glad that we were able to sign him. However, it was our defense that finally won us a Superbowl!
Yea, that was a pretty gifted defense that you guys had assembled the season before last.
I feel that Von Miller really got us that Superbowl.
Yea, he was very dominant and still is.
I think he is the best player in the league right now.
That is kind of hard to argue to be honest with you.
Being a Giants fan, you know all about Superbowl victories, right?
Well it has been a while at this point. I just wish we could get one more and I would be happy for a while!
Do you think the pieces are there?
Well, I know Eli Manning can get the job done. We have some other great talents as well; I am just not sure about the coaching right now.
I know what you mean there. Tom Coughlin is not walking through that door anytime soon!
I wish he was still the coach to be honest. I know he had some bad years, but he would have fixed things!
I agree, I mean he did win two Superbowls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many superbowls have there been?
Hm, well the NFL has been around for almost 100 years, right?
Yeah, but I don't think superbowls started when the NFL started.
That's weird, I wonder why.
I guess they didn't come up with the superbowl yet until later.
Definetely, I think the first one was in 1967.
Darn, that's 40 something years after the NFL formed.
Yeah, I think only a handful of teams have ever won.
Definetely, it's unlikely all 32 have won.
Yep, just from a probability standpoint.
I think the Packers have won the most.
Yep, Patriots in a close second, probably.
Patriots? I would say the Steelers.
Nah, they're good but they aren't THAT good.
You know 27 superbowls have been in only 3 cities?
Wow, really?
Yep, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Miami.
That's interesting, places that are already extremely populated.
Yeah, the superbowl stats are so interesting.
Agreed, they are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how do you feel about the upcoming season?
Kind of depressed, actually!
Why?
I'm a Jets fan and I feel like we don't have any of our long-time guys anymore.
Yeah, that's true. Who did you lose?
We got rid of Mangold, Harris, Decker, and Marshall.
That's rough.  Didn't Marshall go to the Giants, too?
Yeah, which makes it even worse.  I'm happy for him though.
He seems like a good guy.
Yeah, I like that he took a stand a few years ago and wore the green cleats for mental health awareness.
Is there any chance that any of the other AFC East teams knock off the Pats?
Probably not, but we'll see how Tannehill comes back from injury.
The Dolphins are always a little bit better than they should be.
And the Bills are always a little bit worse than they should be.
It honestly has not been fair for over a decade with Bellichick and Brady running the show.
Yeah, but I think it might be more Bellichick than Brady.
Why?
Well when Brady is hurt or suspended they continue to win.
The Pats won't lose the East until they're both gone.
That's probably true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've had something in my mind regarding the future of the NFL
What is it?
After guys like Brady, Brees, Rodgers and Big Ben retire who do you think will be the top guys at the position?
it's hard to say. Mostly because I don't think Brady is ever going to retire. Second, I don't know the future of the upcoming quarterbacks for the draft.
True. Hard to judge the future of the position when there will be 20 or 30 new quarterbacks drafted by the time they are all gone.
To answer your question. I think it might be someone like Dak or Russell Wilson.
What about Carr?
Oh yeah definitely Carr. I think I might have to edit my answer. I forgot about him.
Do you think Cousins could ever hit that tier?
I'm really not sure. His Win/Loss record against good teams isn't that impressive.
The 'Skins don't seem to be too faithful in him. They keep dangling him on one year deals.
I suppose with good reason. He still needs to play better in big games.
What about Newton? You don't think he can take over the league?
He could, but I find his style of play to be too physical to maintain.
I find he is kind of like a worse version of Big Ben. Cam's more athletic, but his accuracy and decision making is a lot worse.
Yeah definitely. Even with a poor offensive line Big Ben still plays amazingly.
I think Cam may make a few more Pro-Bowls, but outside of that I don't think he will dominate.
His career hasn't been as good as people say it has.
It is crazy to think we are in the brink of a generation change at the quarterback position.
I always fear we will hit a wall where there's no legitimately great ones in the league, but looks like we have plenty of candidates for the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the Redskins ever win a Super Bowl?
Yeah, they won Super Bowl XVII back in the early 80s
Oh really, who did they play back then?
That year they played the Miami Dolphins
Do you remember the final score of the game?
Washington won by ten points.
Wow, so it was a pretty close game.
Yes, Miami was actually winning until the last quarter
Oh wow, so a come from behind win for the Skins
Yes it was.
Who were the coaches back then?
Joe Gibbs for Washington.
And for the Dolphins?
Don Shula
Oh man, he must've coached for awhile.
Yes he did. He was a legendary coach.
Yeah, didn't he coach the only undefeated team in history.
Yes, the 1972 Dolphins.
Yeah, the Pats almost matched that record.
Yes, close, but no cigar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
are you ready for some football?
oh I'm ready for some football alright!
it seems like even though the season starts a little bit earlier every year, the off season seems long an unbearable
I know, right. I always get a little bit depressed after the super bowl, as I know i will be without football for over 6 months
hey, do you know where the super bowl is this year?
this upcoming year its going to be in Minneapolis Minnesota
I guess that means there is no way the vikings are going to be in the super bowl this time then
why do you say that?
well the team of the super bowl host city almost never makes it to the super bowl
how many times has that even happened?
its only happened twice
that's it it? who were the teams that went
The san francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XIX. but they played in Stanford Stadium and not Candlestick. The other team to play the super bowl in their home market was the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV.
The rams played that one in the Rose Bowl, and not the Memorial Coliseum
they lost that game too, to the steelers. can you imagine that, losing the big game while in your own back yard?
did the 49ers win super bowl XIX
they did indeed
go 9ers!
I wonder who the next team will be to play the super bowl in their home market
who knows, it may never happen in our lifetime
XXXXXXXXXXX
Teams report for camp soon.  who is your pick for Super Bowl Champs?
I like the Cowboys.  Their two star rookies from last year, Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliott, should be better.  And , oh that offensive line.
They should do well.  I like Green Bay.
Everybody does at the beginning of the season.  I have to wonder if it's just Aaron Rodgers and 21 other guys.
Tom Brady is getting a little long in the tooth.
Yrs, but he's also quarterback of the defending Super Bowl Champs.
What about the LA Rams?
It all revolves around Goff and Todd Gurley.  If they produce, the Rams could make some noise.
I doubt that.  What is with the Raiders?  Las Vegas?  Really?
The NFL doesn't like gambling, but they move to Vegas.  Makes you wonder.
Yes, it does.
It's putting the wolf in charge of the henhouse.
The Falcons laid an egg in the second half of the Super Bowl last year.
It was hard to watch.  They could do nothing right and the Pats could follow no wrong.
It will be interesting to see how they overcome that this year.
They should do all right.  The NFC South is one of the weaker divisions.
Is the NFL all right?  Viewership was way down last year.
Nothing goes up forever.  Maybe this is the tipping point for them.
Hopefully view ship will come back.  A good season for most of the teams will help.
Cowboys baby.  They're Americas team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know anything about football?
Are you talking about European football or American football?
What's the difference?
Well, European football is what Americans call Soccer and American football is like the NFL.
What is the NFL?
Are you serious? Everyone knows what the NFL is!
Well I don't. I don't like sports much and I don't follow it at all.
You must have been living under a rock! The NFL is the National Football League.
Oh okay, so you mean the big teams like the Broncos and the Cowboys.
Yes that's right. Those are actually two of my favorite teams.
How can you like a Colorado team and a Texas team when you are from New Mexico?
You don't have to be from a particular state to like their football team.
I think I like the Seahawks then.
Why the Seahawks? What is so special about them?
They are an NFL team aren't they?
Yes they are but why does that matter if you have never heard of the NFL before?
It doesn't matter. I was just asking.
You never answered why you like the Seahawks.
It's because I like their colors. Blue and green go really well together and their logo is cool too.
You're hopeless! What difference does it make what colors they choose? It's about how well they play the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are the most common injuries in the NFL?
It's easiest to describe injuries by their location.
Okay, what body parts are most commonly injured in the NFL?
It typically goes in this order: knee, ankle, thigh, shoulder, and head.
Wow, that's interesting!
I agree. As you can see, the injuries cover the whole body from head to toe.
Yes, I see that. I'm particularly interested in knee injuries.
That makes sense. About 20% of all injuries in the NFL involve the knee.
What happens?
Typically, the players move awkwardly and damage the knee. Or, they receive a direct hit to the knee.
What's going on inside the knee during these injuries?
They are typically tears.
What actually tears?
Either the meniscus or the ligament tears.
How do doctors fix this damage?
It takes reconscruction surgery. They use grafts from other locations.
How long is the player out?
They should be back on the field within a few months.
That's pretty amazing!
It is -- especially since many NFL careers have been ended by knee injuries. Yet, today, most players quickly recover.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pre-Season  is just about here. I can't wait
yea it's really starting to feel like football
Who is your favorite team
I'm a raider fan
Oh wow Raiders moving to Las Vegas pretty soon
Yea it might be a little weird at first but what a great city for football
I'm a Viking fan
Oh wow the Super Bowl is in Minnesota this year.
Yes it is and I'm hoping the Vikings can be there
They had a great start last season
Yea , the injuries caught up to them last season
They had a killer defense early on
I think the Vikings need to be able to stretch the field with a deep passing game it will really help the running game.
How do feel about A Peterson being gone?
I'm actually glad AP is out.  I think the vikings have some good young backs
Right , Im hoping the Raiders will also improve on last season.
Well they have A fantastic QB I wish Minnesota had a QB like the Raiders
Yes , If the Raiders can clean up the Defense they have a good chance to go pretty far in 2017
I agree well let's hope its The Vikings and Raiders in Minnesota for the Super Bowl
Oh wow A rematch like 40 years later that would be fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the NFL?
It's incredible.
I think they are the top sport out there in America.
Others might say baseball, but football has the wow factor.
Where else can you sit in front of your tv and feel like you are at the game?
I can't think of anywhere else.
It's such a unifying sport.
The action and excitement just radiate throughout my body when I watch it.
I think a lot of people feel that way.
Watching the NFL players tackle each other brings a rush to me.
I love seeing them race across the field to the goal line.
The kick-off excites me as well.
I can't believe how far those guys can kick the ball.
They have feet of steel.
They have bodies of steel.
They are solid.
What I like best is cheering them on in my favorite jersey.
You are one dedicated fan.
Yes, I have my own Eagles room in my house.
Recliner and all?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts about the NFC West this year?
I am honestly not sure.
I mean, I think the regular teams are likely picks
I agree. Its sort of Seattle, then the others
That might not be a bad hting though
Good point, its nice to see parity
I think its interesting compared to the NBA
How so?
Well there are less "super" teams in football
I am not sure I agree..the Patriots? Seattle?
Well those are good examples but I'd agrue those are coach based.
Maybe you have a point there
I know it is the case with New Englad at aleast
I agree. Belicheck really is a genuis despite what others say
I just dont get how he can put it all together
No one does
Do you think they will repeat?
Who?
The Patriots
I am not sure...they have a good chance for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When do the 49ers start their summer training camp?
I think it is the 3rd week in July. The 22nd I believe.
Are you going down to see them?
I will try to see a couple of practices during the week.
Did you get the single ticket offer in mail yesterday?
I did. I'm thinking about doing it.
Me too. I'm a little concerned about where my seats might be.
Have you thought about the standing section in the back?
Can you see the 49ers bench from there?
Yes, you get a pretty decent view of both teams from those seats.
Do you think the 49ers will have a .500 season?
I hope so. They handed out some pretty big contracts if the off season.
I think the coach will be gone if they don't
I'm not sure about that. They've got him for 3 more years.
Yeah - it will probably take a something awful to happen before they move him
Did you make your Superbowl reservation yet?
I've got the hotel room - we'll see what happens
I think our ticket options will be very limited, unless we want to spend a coupe grand
I would get moving on flight and hotel if you are the least bit interested in being there for game time
I'll reach out to my ticket broker today
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are their any new rule changes in the NFL this season?
Yes their is.
What are they?
No more sideline hood for the refs.
What do you mean?
The reviews are handled from the command center in New York.
Stronger enforcement of very egregious hits penalties.
And what is that.
Intentionally violent hits could get you a one game suspension as well as getting ejected from the game.
They should come down harder on dirty hits.
No need for that.
There was talk of only a 10 minute overtime period.
It's designed to reduce the amount of snaps a player takes in a game or sea.
I'm not sure about that.
They tabled it for now.
That's good.
They will be more lenient in touchdown celebrations.
I don't like the celebrations.
I don't either,but the penalties are kind of stupid.
Yea,I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just met a very handsome NFL player.
Oh yeah, where?
At the Shaker's Bar & Grill.
That place is known for NFL players.
I didn't know that!
I'm assuming you just wanted lunch?
That and dessert!
So was he cute?
Yes, he was.
Give up the name, girl.
Damon Woods.
He's a tight end?
You got it!
Wow, he's a catch.
I think so too!
His game comes on later.
I'll be watching.
Let's make it a party!
After I call him!
I shall wait, my dear!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does football season start?
Football goes all year long.
What do you mean?
I mean the business of football goes all year.
What happens offseason?
Let's see. February there are regional combines.  March is free agency. April is the draft of course.
Oh yeah, the draft, that is important isn't it?
Yes it is.  The draft process is what keeps the league competitive and allows the league to have parity.
Parity? What does that mean?
It means that any given team can win on any given Sunday.
So it means the Cleveland Browns are as good as the New England Patriots?
Not exactly. What it really means is that the Browns will get the most help from the draft.
So that they can be better in the future?
Exactly, the best teams will, in theory, become worse and the worse teams will become better.
So how long does it take?
The truth is, it can take many years.
So there really is no parity.
Maybe not in a given season, but overall, free agency and the draft keep teams competitive.
So that means, that sometime in the far off future, a team will beat the Patriots?
Exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi
Want to talk about the nfl?
Sure that sounds great
I watch every game
Me too
I love to go to sports bars and watch the games
That is so much fun
It is
Watching the nfl is definitely more fun with others
I could agree more
And having a cold beer is great too
Good friends and good drinks
Makes the perfect nfl experience
Exactly
The sports bars get all the games too
Yea, thats another great reason to go there
Exactly
Love it
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about them Packers?
Well, what about them?
Well we are both from Wisconsin, thought you'd be interested in the Pacs.
You know I haven't really watch much since Brett Favre got squashed into retirement.
Yeah, that was funny.
Sure was funny.
Well then what about them Bears?
What about them?
They are the other football team closest to Wisconsin.
Yep, they sure are, to bad they haven't won any titles since 86.
What's your favorite NFL team?
Its hard to say, it just seems so hard to win a championship.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
It doesn't matter much to me, I guess whatever team wins the most.
I think the Patriots win the most.
Oh yeah, is that so?
Yeah, they are like always winning.
Well maybe because they work harder than everyone else.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Defense wins the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't see the television!
You don't want to see this!
What happened? What?
Cleveland scored again.
No!  Not again!
And they didn't even use their first string quarterback!
Are you kidding me? Who was it?
They used that Heisman-winning QB.
Johnny Football?
Johnny Football!
I thought he was canned.
Apparently not. Rehab maybe?
I guess. Why is it that so many NFL football players get a little money and then go off the deep end?
It's not just football players.  THis happens with players from alot of different types of sports.
Yeah, but football players always seem to get a bad rap.  Why is that?
A violent game breeds violent people maybe? Or maybe it's Jealousy...
Jealousy is probably a part of it, and self-control is no something you are born with, but I think it is because players bring attention to themselves when they are a 400-lb offensive lineman or the starting quarterback of a professonal football team, with a gazzillion dollar contract. Hard to hide your indescretions when you are famous.
I suppose so.  But you never hear about all the good things these players do off the field!
Like what?
Like all the charities they start or support. I wish society valued that as much as who can throw a ball the farthest!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well I just hope the Falcons get it, really.
The cowboys are where its really at.
The cowboys huh? When did you start liking the, August?
Well, I am now a Cowboys fan perse; I am a Dak fan.
I also love Dak but I am not a banwagoner.
I will always bandwagon for Dak, #Hailstate
Ive been liking the Falcons since 2002 and you dont know my struggle.
Back to the seahawks, how do you think Wilson is going to do this year?
I dont really know, things are tough since lynch has going to the Raiders.
How dumb is it that they are going to Vegas?
That is so dumb!
The fans are really getting screwed there!
Is just like how the rams fans were screwed.
I really do not like the moving of teams.
Next thing we know, they will move one to the UK
Yeah, Robert is getting power hungry.
I really hope they dont move the falcons anywhere!
I also hope they dont move the seahawks.
Well friend, nice to see you!
It was nice to see you too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How to you think the Miami Dolphins will do this year?
Same as every year, not good.
You really don't like the Dolphins do you?
I think they are an overrated franchise.
They were good when Don Shula was the coach.
Yeah that was in the 70s and 80s.  What have the done in the last 30 years?
They had some good teams with Dan Marino.
Some good teams that never won a Super Bowl.
The Dolphins still have the only undefeated team in history.
That's there only claim to fame anymore.
Well, I think they will be good this year.
I think they will win 6-8 games.
You don't think the will win half their games?
I don't think Ryan Tannehill is that good a quarterback.
He's still young.
That is true but I don't think he will ever be anything special.
Hey atleast he's a quarterback they can build around.
I guess you can build around an average quarterback.
The Raven won a Super Bowl with an average quarterback.
The Raven also had the best defense in the league that year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think it's right that tax payers help pay for a new football stadium?
I think that since it helps bring revenue to the city, then it's kind of a good deal.
The problem I have with it is that the money never really transfers over back to the tax payers. Only the owners get rich.
I suppose it still benefits the people of the city since they get a new stadium for their team.
But what about the tax payers who don't care about the NFL? What if they don't watch football or any kind of sport?
Yeah, I guess that would suck for them.
Exactly. I never did understand why taxpayers had to help pay the bill for a stadium to built.
Probably because it would be way to expensive for an owner to foot the bill themselves.
But if that's the case, then they shouldn't be owning a team in the first place.
I don't disagree with you there. But like I said, it does benefit the city one way or another.
The way I see it, if the owner of a team wants a new stadium, then they should pay for it themselves. These guys are so rich.
I think if that was the case, you would only see a few NFL football teams in a few cities. There aren't that many people willing to spend that much.
I guess that would be bad since I actually like watching football. But there has to be a better way than using taxpayer money.
I guess they can compromise by having some of the revenue that teams earn be guaranteed to going back to some of the city's needs like paying for infrastructure and programs.
Well, I would be down for that. I just think there has to be more transparency.
Well, considering you're a tax payer, you have the right to bring it up to your local officials.
Yeah, I don't think that's something I'm gonna have the determination to do. I just thought it was always a weird thing.
I  agree with you that if I were somebody that didn't watch sports, I would hate to know that my money was going to fund something I had no desire to watch.
Maybe they should just tax the people who are football fans.
I would just pretend I didn't like football and not get taxed while I watch secretly in the comfort of my home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited to repeat this year.
Yes, Brady is going to get his sixth.
That is the same amount the Jordan won.
Yes, but it is harder to win in the NFL, so many more players.
Yes, he's already the greatest, this will just add to his legacy.
Really cool to have been able to see him play too.
Definitely something to talk about to the grand kids.
Do you think we can go undefeated this season?
I don't think so, I think we will get above 12 wins, but we will not go full throttle if we lock up the conference.
Yes, better to go into the playoffs healthy.
Yep, it matters what we do in the post season, not going undefeated and losing the game when it matters most.
Still remember that season, we looked unstoppable.
Well that did not end how we though it would.
I think we've learned greatly from that, but Brady will be 40 this season as well.
It is crazy how long he has sustained this level of play.
Yeah, at this rate he will be playing till 50.
As long as he plays at a elite level he can play as long as he wants.
That's funny, I also really hope we keep Jimmy so we have that heir apparent.
Yes, that should be a priority.
Well let's go and repeat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think David Johnson is the best running back in the NFL
For the Cardinals?
Yes. He was at least the best of 2016
He was impressive to watch
Who do you think is the best?
Adrian Peterson hands down
He plays for the Vikings?
Yep. anyone else you liked?
Not running back wise
Who was your favorite kicker?
I like Mason Crosby
Of the Packers?
Yep. Who do you like?
Graham Gano of the Panthers
Did he tackle anyone this year?
I don't think so
I always love it when kickers have to tackle
They're scrappy little guys.
Mason Crosby made a nice tackle last season
I saw that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want kickoffs abolished?
I wouldnt mind having each team starting at the 20.
Yeah I think thats better.
Would it eliminate commercials though?
I think it would almost have to.
The NFL needs to speed games up
Yeah I think they do as well.
Its a bit odd that they dont try a bit harder.
They should eliminate extra points as well.
That would be like taking an entire position away
Yeah they should do that so teams can carry a punter.
I would be OK with that to be perfectly honest.
You could carry an extra offensive player
Or defense.
Yeah I mean it works out for everyone
Would the players union allow that?
I am sure they would outside of the kicker player reps
That would be a monumental change for the league
I think it could happen way quicker than we think
As long as it makes the game faster I think most fans are behind it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any NFL predictions for the upcoming season?
I don't think you ever count out New England.
Well I agree with that.
I think you have to watch out for the raiders.
I agree,they could be tough.
In the NFC I think Green Bay has a good shot.
They are usually going to be in the mix.
I'm not sold on the Cowboys being that good this year.
It will be interesting to see what Prescott and Elliot do in year two.
The league has a way of adjusting to rookies.
Yes it does.
I'm hearing talk of Tampa bay rising to the top.
I've read some things.
Watch out for Seattle too.
They always seem to be solid defensively.
Defense keeps you in games.
The Giants should be right there especially with their defense.
The defense should actually be better.
I agree with that.
They only lost one starter on defense from last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you want to come watch the NFL Football game at my house this Sunday?
Sure, I'll see if I can make it, I might even have tickets to go to one this weekend.
Really? Which one are you going to?
My friend has tickets to see the Miami Dolphins and I would love to take a road trip to Miami to see them Monday night.
That's amazing! I always thought you were a Tampa Bay fan more than a Miami fan.
Yeah I am but you cant turn down going to a Monday night football game especially when it's so warm.
How do you like their new logo and uniforms?
I think they are really cool. I do miss the old logo but I suppose the new dolphin could grow on me.
Do you think their color has changed? The green just seems a little bit different to me.
Yeah the colors seem a little different but whatever it takes to progress and update the team.
Speaking of updating the team, what do you think of them getting a DE in the first round of the draft?
I'm not really sure! I don't follow the team that closely to have an opinion but I hear he's really good.
Yeah my friend watched the entire draft at my house and now I have all this useless information in my head!
I wouldn't say it's useless, I wish I knew it before I go to see the game!
Where are your seats located in their stadium?
Right behind the goal posts so we'll get to see all the extra points go through the posts.
Hopefully you'll get to see a cool celebration if they all aren't still banned by the league.
Yeah, they're playing the Steelers so Antonio Brown will probably dance in the end zone for us!
I'm so jealous, I wish I could go too!
If I don't end up getting tickets we will have to watch it at your house!
XXXXXXXXXXX
With the 2017 NFL season starting what do you think of the Jets prospects?
Well, first of all I am still mad they are the New York Jets but play in New Jersey.
Where do the New York Jets play?
They play in MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford New Jersey.
Why dont they build and play in a stadium in New York ?
There really is no place near New York City that would be a good location.  The NY Yankees and Mets already have two large stadiums in the Bronx and Queens.
Are they the only team playing in MetLife Stadium?
No, in fact they share that stadium with the New York Giants
How is it possible for two NFL teams to share the same stadium ?
Each NFL team only has a certain number of home games. The Jets and Giants coordinate the schedules to avoid a home game conflict.
Ok,  thinking long term when is the super bowl 52  going to be for 2018
Super Bowl 52 is scheduled to be played Sunday, Feb. 4 2018
Where will Superbowl 52 be played?
It will be played in  Minneapolis  at the U.S. Bank Stadium.
What happens if it is bad weather in Minneapolis in February 2018.  Can it get cancelled?
No, the  US Bank Stadium has a dome in case of bad weather.
Is the US Bank Stadium a new NFL team stadium?
Yes, US Bank Stadium is new and was just finished in 2016.
What NFL team plays in the US Bank Stadium?
The Minneapolis Vikings play in the US Bank Stadium.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you want to an NFL game this year.
Not really I would much rather watch the games at home
Why going to games are great
Not if it's cold out I'm always miserable plus I'm a Jets fan so they seem to always lose.
Think the Jets will be any good this year
Not a chance they will be terrible.
Do you think the Patriots are going to win the division.
Yeah unless Brady gets hurt they are going to win the division.  I just hope they don't win the Superbowl
I don't think they are making it to the Super Bowl this year, I like the Raiders
I don't know about that the Raiders are still young and unfortunately the Pats are loaded.
Well Raiders, Packers I'm calling it.
Probably going to be Giants Pats another rematch.
That would be great you think the Giants could do it again.
For my sanity I sure hope so.  Eli beats Brady again would be great.
What about the Dolphins
I don't like the Dolphins I hope they tank
Ha, think Cowboys will dominate again this year
I expect them to take a huge step back this year
I'm so excited for the start of the season.  It's almost here!
Yeah we will see how it goes this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which football team is from Dallas?
I think you are referring to the Dallas Cowboys.
Yes, I think they have the most famous cheerleaders.
I agree. They have been around since 1960.
The Dallas Cowboys play in a large stadium.
I believe it is the fifth largest and has a retractable roof.
Which team plays in the city of Atlanta?
The Atlanta Falcons play in the city of Atlanta at the Georgia Dome.
Where do the Tennessee Titans play?
They play their games in Nissan Stadium. It used to be called LP Field.
Does LA have two NFL teams?
Yes, they have the Chargers and the Rams.
What teams were in the Super Bowl last year?
The New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons participated last year.
Which NFL team did Tim Tebow play for?
He played for the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets.
How many Super Bowls has Tom Brady been in?
He has participated in seven with the New England Patriots.
How many NFL franchises are there for 2017?
There are currently thirty-two NFL teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Cowboys are going to be underwhelming this year. What do you think?
Yeah, I agree. I think once some teams have expectations, they seem to fold under the pressure.
Exactly. I think Dak Prescott is going to be a one year wonder.
I wouldn't go that far. But they did over achieve last year.
I think so because other teams will now know how to prepar for him.
But if he's good, does it matter?
I think it does since he's not really anything new that the NFL has never seen before.
I personally think he's pretty good. He has good speed and knows how to operate from the pocket.
I think that's because the Cowboys have an elite offensive line. Without that line, Prescott would be in trouble.
Well, he's still going to have that line.
I think that other teams are going to figure out how to exploit that line and get to Dak Prescott.
On the flip side, you also have to think that he's going to figure things out better in his second year as the starting quarterback.
Maybe. I just think that the pressure is going to get to him.
That's definitely something we can see from a quarterback entering his second year.
I also think some of the Cowboys players have had some trouble with the law, right?
I think I heard that. But I'm not too sure.
Yeah, I don't think any of them were significant role players on the team.
They mustn't have been considering I would have see articles about it online.
But it does seem like a case of the Cowboys acting like the Cowboys again when it comes to getting in trouble with the law.
Yeah, that's never a good thing when your team has expectations now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the greatest team in NFL history?
That's easy, the '72 Miami Dolphins.
Oh come on, really?
Yea, a perfect season warrants that I think.
That was so long ago and its almost happened a few times.
Almost doesn't count, ask Tom Brady if 18-1 is the same as 19-0.
The '72 Dolphins didn't win 18 games, they won 17.
Yea, but they went perfect through the regular season and the post season.
I don't think that makes them the best team ever though.
Why not, who else was better?
Well the 18-1 Patriots for one.
Obviously not, they couldn't win the big one.
I still think they had a better team, maybe not a better season.
Doesn't that translate directly into team?
Not necessarily, do you think the Dan Marino led Dolphins were a good team?
Of course I do, Dan the man baby!
And they never won a superbowl did they?
No they did not.
My point exactly.
I see what you did there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name the teams with the record for the most Super Bowl wins?
The Dallas Cowboys, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Pittsburgh Steelers share the record for most Super Bowl wins.
Really? Are they all the same or is Dallas ahead?
Nope, the teams have won the Super Bowl five times.
That is crazy! Do you think the Patriots will join the likes of them?
Maybe but Brady is getting old.
It's a sad state when 39 is considered old.
I know, right?
Well you know Don Shula, coachog the Baltimore Colts and the Miami Dolphins, won 347 games in his career. That's more than any other coach in NFL history. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1997
That is nuts!
Yeah, did you know Jim Brown led the NFL in rushing more times than any other running back in history?
No I didn't.
He led the league eight times from 1957 to 1965 in his spectacular career.
Spectacular is right. There are so many greats back in the day.
Yeah, you have to wonder with all the high tech training and other stuff like supplements that go on....
How those old timers would have faired in this new world?
Yeah, I mean the advancements in medicine and technology are great but...
But those guys did it before. Yeah, makes me wonder too. How well would the hall of famers do at their peak...
Mano a mano...good question. i would be curious myself.
Yeah, it's not that I'm not grateful for all the advancements but the simplicity of the old days is some thing to take note.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just can't seem to get into football anymore.
Why? What happened?
I just miss watching Peyton Manning.
You could watch highlights on youtube.
Yeah I know, but it's not the same.
There are 32 other starting quarterbacks, and you're sad over one being retired?
None of those other guys are Peyton.
Yeah I guess, but there are some really good ones.
Yeah? Like who? And don't even say Tom Brady.
Well, how about Joe Flacco?
The only thing I know about him is that he likes to eat McDonald's.
How about Jameis Winston?
I don't think he's very good yet.
What about Andrew Luck?
He's good,He just can't stay healthy.
Is that really his fault though?
No, but I would be sad that he was hurt all the time.
What about Big Ben?
Maybe, he's really tough.
Yeah he is, he's awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel bad for Peter Craws.
Is he ok?
He just sustained a season ending injury!
On no.
He already had a kneecap injury.
Did it require surgery?
Yes, two surgeries.
But he came back?
Yes, he healed very quickly.
But what happened next?
He just tore his ACL.
Man, that's tough.
I don't think he'll heal as quickly.
ACL injuries don't heal fast.
Right.
So, he's out for the season?
Yes, unfortunately.
I hope the best for him.
Me too.
Hopefully next season, he'll be back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Browns this year?
I think they are actually going to surprise some people.
I know, right?
They drafted well the last few years and seem to be going in the right direction.
Well its about time.
No kidding, how many years has it been since they were decent.
Well since before they moved?
I think you are right.
Did you hear about the Cinnicinnati option?
No?
Well there is discussion about coaching changes and the impact they might have
For this year?
Well next but I am sure how they all do impacts that.
Crazy!
Speaking of the Bengals what do you think?
i think they have some good pieces but I am not sold
I know, every time I think I am they dissapoint me.
I just don't think they are ready for the big time yet
Maybe if they get some veterans
I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait football season is almost here!
You can say that again.
My wife gets annoyed when I watch too much football.
Mine doesn't. Maybe you can come to my house to watch games sometimes.
Yeah, that would be great!
Okay, we'll do it then.
I can bring some snacks. What do you like to eat?
Just about anything.
I make a pretty mean chili.
Love, love, love chili!
We can do a tailgate type thing sometimes too!
Yeah, burgers or ribs would be great!
I think this is going to be an exciting season.
Yes, lots of good players all around.
Yeah, there's Tom Brady, always good to watch.
I agree, he's great.
Then there's Von Miller.
I really enjoy watching him play too.
Here's to a great NFL season!
Hoping this will be a memorable year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the upcoming NFL season?
I am and hope there is less drama and more football this year.
You must be reffering to the 49ers?
Yes and primarily their quarterback Colin.
What was all the drama about anyway.
Honnestly, I am not sure.  All I can say is Colin destracted from the game and made me not want to watch it.
Was Colin any good at playing.
Colin was not good at all!  The 49ers won only 1 out of 11 games with Colin as quarterback!
WOW, the drama must have been to get attention away from how bad the 49ers were!
That is what I was thinking!  He was going to get cut and then created a bunch of drama to put the spotlight on himself.
Is he playing this year for the Niners?
No, Colin got cut from the 49ers shortly after the season ended!
That is funny, I guess the 49ers didn't want any more Colin drama!
I don't think so and I am glad to get rid of the drama and watch some pigskin get tossed around.
Has Colin been picked up by any other teams?
No, as of now Colin has been shunned by all other teams.
I guess nobody wants the Colin drama on their team!
Yeah, his drama did nothing but ruin the team.
Your right! the Niners had a horrible season last year.
I hope this NFL season is drama free and back to football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the worst a player could perform and still be seen as worthy of the number one overall draft pick?
Eli could be an answer, if were talking NFL performance
What player from the past do you feel is under appreciated?
Herman Moore, Led league in receptions twice in 3 years, 42 TDs in 4-year peak. Made 3 straight 1st team All Pro and nobody ever mentions him as even a top 10 WR of his era
Even though they routinely faced 8 in the box to try and stuff Barry Sanders, Herman Moore and Brett Perriman were legit one of the top 5 duos at WR for a few seasons with fucking Scott Mitchell heaving the ball.
Hey Scott Mitchell was loved by almost every team in the NFC Central, except the Lions.
How dare you disrespect Dave Krieg and Rodney Peete
Man, he snagged Holly Robinson. Ain't no one disrespecting that.
I hated the days of playing against Preist Holmes in two games a year. Then going and playing against LT twice a year. Then of coarse the string of luck with the Chiefs backs after him.
It's nice but I'd rather have that luck with qb or something.
Priest Holmes was the first jersey I ever asked for when I was a kid. The dude pretty much single handed my got me interested in football beyond it being a passing interest.
Besides being an amazing back, wasn't he the guy who would give overly-precise estimates of how much he'd recovered from injuries? "Hey, Priest, how's the leg?" "Oh, about 83 percent. I should be back next week." Was that him or am I getting my wires crossed?
Zach Thomas. He was in the shadow of Brooks/Urlacher/Lewis during his era of linebackers. But man he was less athletic and smaller/slower than all those guys but produced insane numbers. He's criminally underrated.
I very much agree with this. His era really hurt him, but I was a big Zach Thomas fan when he played. Probably an underrated pass coverage linebacker, too.
What is a good ERA for a LB?
I don't really know, but a league where you have to get comparisons to Ray Lewis and Brian Urlacher is definitely not it.
London Fletcher fits this description as well. He was one of the hardest LBs in the game for many years.
Seriously, didn't he even have marginally better stats than Lewis too?
If you don't like him as a person that's fine, but if you think London Fletcher was a better LB than Ray you're high
Yeah for real. Lewis has a legit argument as GOAT MLB and Fletcher just doesn't
XXXXXXXXXXX
You see that Giants and Steelers game last night.
I watched the first half. The Giants didn't do anything.
Yea, but they played a little better in the second half.
Yea, it was weird. The Steelers scored in some strange ways.
They had 4 field goals and a safety.
I know. I didn't even want to watch the second half.
I watched the whole thing until the end.
Say, what was the final score anyway?
The Giants scored 14 but the Steelers scored 24 points.
How many yards did Roethlisberger pass for?
He had about 289 yards.
What about Manning? How did he do?
Manning had less passing yards with 195.
Who was the Giants rush leader?
Perkins led the Giants with only 38 rush yards.
The Steelers shut down the rush game for the Giants.
Yep, Eli had to rely on his keen passing to stand a chance.
Who led the Steelers with rushing yards?
LeVeon Bell had 118 rushing yards.
Okay. We will see how the games go next week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My wife asked me last week if there was anything special I wanted for my birthday next month.
Happy early birthday! How old are you going to be?
45. For her last birhday, my wife wanted something really special. So she was checking to make sure in case I wanted something big too.
What did your wife want for her birthday?
A fancy ring with gemstones and diamonds she saw at the mall. It cost over two grand.
Wow, and you bought it?! You're a really great husband.
I know, so don't you think if I wanted something nice I should get equal treatment?
Of course, what did you ask for?
You know how I love football, and the Pats, and Tom Brady. I want an autographed football helmet they have listed online in the official NFL shop that's signed by Tom Brady.
That sounds like a great present for you! What's the problem?
My wife refuses to buy it. She said it is way too much money for something that sits on a shelf.
Uh oh, how much is it?
Fifteen hundred dollars. But it's authentic. It's hand signed by Brady, and has a certificate from the NFL that it's authentic.
Would it lose value later if someone suspected it wasn't authentic?
It has a special hologram with a number that will show if it's tampered with. This helps guarantee it's the real deal.
Did you try telling your wife it could actually increase in value after Brady retires?
I tried to tell her it was an investment and could always be sold later, but she thinks the value will go down.
Generally that might be true, but when you're talking about one of the great, well known players like Brady, the value should at least hold even.
It's a Super Bowl Champions helmet, signed by a five time Super Bowl Champion, so I'm sure it would still retain its value.
Well, the only thing you can do is just keep mentioning over and over how you bought her the ring she wanted, but if she isn't going to reciprocate, then in the future you will just get her small sensible gifts, and that will scare her into getting you that helmet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Miami Dolphins are going to do this year?
I'm not expecting much out of them as usual. They're always kind of mediocre.
Yeah it must be disappointing to be a Dolphins fan. It's like the organization doesn't even try.
From my experience, Dolphins fans aren't as passionate about their team as other fanbases.
Yes I've been to a game at Hard Rock Stadium and it almost felt more like a social event than a football game.
Miami has some pretty good player on their roster though. That's something for their fans to get excited about.
Ryan Tannehill is a really good, underrated quarterback in the NFL I think.
Don't forget Ndamukong Suh on their defense. He's actually the highest paid player on the team.
Of the three NFL teams in the state of Florida, which do you think is going to have the best season in 2017?
I haven't been following those teams too closely but I would actually say that the Dolphins will do the best in 2017.
Really? You don't think Tampa Bay will have a good year?
Like I said, I haven't been following too closely but I think that Miami has the stronger roster and a slightly easier schedule.
Miami and Tampa Bay actually play each other in Week One of the season.
That might be an interesting game. I'll predict that Miami will win by a touchdown.
Do you think that the Dolphins have a chance to beat the Patriots when they play later in the season?
Absolutely not. Unless New England has a lot of injuries, I cannot see any way that Miami wins that game.
So what is a game on Miami's schedule that you think they have a chance to upset someone?
I'll predict that they have a good chance to win when they play at Atlanta.
That's a bold prediction that they'll defeat a team that went to the Super Bowl.
I just have have a good feeling about the match ups in the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Sunday afternoon games on Fox, but there's on massive issue for me.
So nice of you to say hello before you spoke
Sorry.
Anyway, go ahead.
I love The Simpsons
Me too!
But so much Sunday TV, especially that show, are delayed week after week.
Why?
Runover. Once a game starts, they're contractually obligated to show the complete game.
Aren't they at 4pm?
Yes.
So they should be over by 7, 7:30 at the latest.
You're forgetting about an extra half hour.
Which is?
The post-game coverage. They for some reason HAVE to examine the game on TV after it airs.
Yeah, I hate that too, I just don't watch Sunday TV outside of non-sports channels so I haven't considered it.
Does the same post-game happen on CBS and NBC?
You know what, I'm not sure.
You don't watch those networks at night?
Nope, at least not on Sunday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you an NFL fan?
I break out my jersey and fire up the grill every Sunday!
Who is your favorite team?
The New Orlean Saints.
They have a lot of really good players.
If Drew Brees can stay healthy they are Super Bowl contenders.
He is getting pretty old. Think he can maintain such a higj success rate?
He has a lot of good receivers backing him up.
Michael Thomas had a pretty good season.
So did Mike Ingram and with Adrian Peterson joining the team we will be strong at the Running Back position.
Why did they take AP when they already have Ingram?
Ingram may or may not remain consistent. Either way you don't pass on a legend like AP.
I would have thought he would have retired a Viking but I guess he wants to see more playing time and I am not sure he would have received that with the Vikings.
With the two strong Running Backs on the Saints Brees will not have to throw as much.
The dual running and receiving threats will give defenses something to struggle with.
Thag should create more opportunities for Brees to complete passes.
I still don't think he will maintain 4-5 touchdowns a game like he typically does.
Probably not if they are running the ball more.
If they can keep Drew healthy and get past the Falcons they may have a shot this year.
They will destroy the dirty birds this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the NFC South this season?
That's a good question. I think that Jameis Winston will have a breakout season and lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to first in the division.
Do you think it's likely that for the third time in three years, the NFC South will have an average quarterback come out of nowhere and dominate the league?
When you put it like that, it sounds unlikely. However, he has an elite receiving core with the addition of DeSean Jackson.
Jackson is an excellent deep threat and I predict that he will complement Mike Evans. However, the defense worries me.
What about Gerald McCoy? He's coming off his fifth Pro Bowl season.
True, although their defensive secondary leaves much to be desired.
It's probably their weakest element, but I'm still optimistic. Who do you think will win the NFC South this season?
I'd have to predict the Carolina Panthers.
Really? They had an awful 6-10 record last season.
Yeah, but I think that Cam Newton will bounce back. Furthermore, I'm very excited to see how they use Christian McCaffrey.
He should be an excellent player on offense. However, I'm worried that Cam Newton's propensity to run the ball will open him up to injury, which could hurt their overall offense.
I think that they drafted McCaffrey to put Cam Newton in better positions so that he won't run the ball as much.
Maybe, although Cam Newton is the type of player that does front flips into the end zone. I think that he will continue to put himself at risk for injury.
Newton's size definitely contributes to his fearlessness while playing. However, I feel that the combination of Christian McCaffrey, Greg Olsen, and a healthy Kelvin Benjamin will allow him to distribute the ball more.
We'll see. However, their defense is probably worse situated than Tampa Bay.
I disagree. Luke Kuechly is still one of the best linebackers in the league and they have many underrated players like Shaq Thompson.
But their secondary has never fully recovered since Josh Norman left for the Washington Redskins. Furthermore, their defensive coordinator just departed to become the head coach of the Buffalo Bills.
True. However, Ron Rivera is a former defensive coordinator himself, so I'm not overly concerned regarding a huge drop off in terms of defense.
We'll see. It's funny though that neither of us picked the defending NFC Champion Atlanta Falcons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch last years Superbowl?
Yes I did. What a rollercoaster of game.
Probably the craziest Superbowl I have ever watched in my entire life.
Oh yeah def. a top 3 Superbowl of all time.
I still can't wrap my mind around how bad the Falcons choked.
Blew a 23-3 lead after halftime, yeah I would say they choked pretty bad.
I despise the Patroits but you have to give respect were respect is due.
Couldn't have said it better myself. I hate Tom Brady with a passion but that man is very talented.
Brady's not even that good of a quarterback, it's Bill Belichick who deserves most the credit.
I think Brady is decent but he's not as good as like Drew Brees when it comes to executing passes. But yeah Belichick is a mad man.
Drew Brees has had like 6 5,000 yard seasons, you can't compare the two.
I agree but it was oddly satisfying seeing the Falcons crumble and burn live on television.
I was about to turn off the game at halftime, I'm glad I didn't.
Ha c'mon man it's still the Superbowl. I was going to finish watching it regardless.
Did you see the end when the entire stadium started to boo Roger Goodell?
That was probably the highlight of the entire Superbowl.
I hate that guy with a burning passion.
Same here and I think every other NFL fan does too
Do you know what NFL stands for?
The "No Fun League"
XXXXXXXXXXX
The draft picks are chosen.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.  I've been following Ivan Smith.
Is he good?
He was the best player at SMU, so they pulled him quick.
Oh ok, I've heard of him!
They're hoping he's strong enough for the league.
Why?
Because he only weighs 156 lbs.
That's small. Height?
I think he's about 6 feet.
Ok, yes that's kinda small.
He will beef up soon.
As he matures in the league.
I'm sure they'll up his dietary intake.
Lots of steak for him!
He has to gain weight.
Is it a requirement?
I'm sure it's not, but recommended.
Oh, I see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the jets will play.500 ball this year?
I don't think they'll win 5 games.
You think they're that bad?
I know they are.
Who's the starting quarterback?
I don't believe they even know.
Do you think josh McGowan will start?
I don't know.
He has the most experience.
That's about all he has.
Yea,he's a journeyman.
To say the least.
Do you think Bryce petty will be any good?
It's possible he can turn out ok.
Bad organization to start your career with.
I don't understand why they released Brandon Marshall.
He was their number one receiver.
The Giants snatched him quickly.
He'll do well with the Giants.
I think so too
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so excited for football this year.
Do you mean College or NFL?
NFL.
They are both fun to watch.
Yes but I prefer NFL.
What is your favorite team?
I like the Seahawks.
They are a good team.
I am a bit Russel Wilson fan.
He is a great player.
I like that he is a threat with his arms and his legs.
He must be one of the fastest QB's don't you think.
Yes, I think I have heard that.
He has been a great player since leaving Wisconsin.
He was good in College and has gotten even better now.
He seems to get along with Pete Carrol as well.
He does.
That is important for the QB and coach to get along.
Things don't work well if they don't.
No, it can be a bad situation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the winner of the first Super Bowl?
It was Green Bay.
Oh really?
Yes, there weren't nearly as many teams back then. They won the first two.
Do they have the most?
No, I think that's the Steelers with six.
How many does Green Bay have then?
Four I think. The first two, one in the '90s and one in 2011.
Who did they beat in 2011?
Actually, I'm pretty sure it was the Steelers?
Patriots have to be closing in on the Steelers right?
They have five, and all of them in the 2000s and 2010s.
That's really impressive.
I know. And from what I hear, I think they are favorites for next year.
Yes, but so much can happen in a season.
Very true. They need to stay healthy and with a 40 year old quarterback, that isn't easy.
It is pretty amazing to see how good Brady still is.
Well, he takes really good care of himself.
He definitely does. I'm looking forward to seeing what he can do this year.
Well, you are a Pats fan, so I guess you would be!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, a lot of people think football is young man's game.
That's because they end up getting hurt and can't play that long.
There was an article I read about ten NFL players who are over 35 and doing great.
You mean like Tom Brady?
Yep, of course Brady. He's 39 and won his fifth Super Bowl last year.
I know a lot of people were talking about the Cardinal's Carson Palmer last year, because he had a rough season.
Yeah, but the year before he was an MVP candidate.
And of there's Drew Brees. He's like 38 or 39, and still very much in the game.
He's really popular with the fans, and he has this great cancer foundation.
I think a lot depends on their postition. Quarterbacks and kickers could probably play longer.
This is true, linemen are going to get injured a lot faster.
There was some speculation about Brady's health.
Oh yeah, I read that. Where his wife said he had concussions, but the coaches or whatever backtracked that.
I could see Brady trying to hold out a couple more years though, hoping for another Super Bowl ring or two.
I saw in one of the gossip rags how those rings got him in trouble.
How's that?
H was flying on Ben Affleck's plane and let Ben's nanny try on his Super Bowl rings.
Brady's wife Gisele seems like a tiger, I doubt she liked that.
No, I think he was in the doghouse explaining that.
Brady seems to attract controversy like a magnet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Sure am, what do you think the Colts will do this year?
I hate to say it, but I think they'll be pretty bad.
I agree, it all depends on Andrew Luck though. He needs to carry this team.
Carry this team is right, they're awful if he's not playing well.
Yeah I agree, the Colts front office has really let Andrew down.
Yeah that cupboard is bare.
No help in the offseason for Hilton.
Nope none, plus they have a running back in Frank Gore who could be in AARP soon.
Yeah very little planning ahead by them.
I hate that Chuck Pagano is still coach too.  He is terrible.
Oh man, remember that fake punt play last year?
Oh yeah, Pagano should have been fired right there on the spot.
I couldn't believe that he wasn't.
Who is their tight end this year? Is it still the guy from Stanford?
No it's a new guy, I think they got rid of him last year. Some guy named Swoope.
Well I hope he's good.
Yeah me too. I think anyone will be better than Fleener.
Oh that's right, Fleener.
Well let's go Colts!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do yo like Cedric Thorton?
Yea he is a great defensive tackle.
The Cowboys do have a good team.
Do you know they signed him to a four year contract?
No I did not.
Do you know how much he gets paid????
No I dont know, how much?
17 million dollars!!
Holy Cow, that sure is a lot of money just to play football.
Yea some of those players get paid so much!
Yea and for doing something they love to do.
Can't be a very hard job.
I dont know about that..
Cedric only had 22 tackles in 13 games last season.
Not too great.
I think they are expecting more from him this season.
Well it is his second season so maybe he will do a bit better.
I hope so.
Well if he doesnt he won't be renewed after his contract is up.
Yes, that is true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We havent talked much about the Steelers.
Yeah, they havent been too exciting as of late.
The only reason i think of Pittsburg is because Bradshaw is on Fox Sports.
Ha, true.
Thry got to face the Ravens and Lions this season.
Lions suck, no problem there.
Sorry, i meant the Titans.
Yeah, there a bit more formatable than the Lions.
Haha, true.
They got the Texans and a New England game also.
Now the New England game may show some sizzle.
Hopefully. They play mostly afternoon games or night games too, i hate that.
Sprcially if it is on a sunday. i hate when the NFL tries to go up against The Walking Dead!
HA, i know, they have LOST ratings to the dead before.
I know, not last year but the year before it was like three times in a row TWD beat out the NFL.
Unless it's the Bucs i'll watch TWD instead of football.
Same here or FTWD.
Well, i'll bounce the DVR to record FTWD and Talking afterwards especially if it's the Bucs or Miami
I think Tampa only played 2 night games and like 1 afternoon game.
I think so too, we didnt have many steaks during NFL last season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Soon we get to see how good the SeaHawks have been practicing in the off season!
I know, I am extremely excited!  Are you?
Yes, Very excited to see the Hawks kick some butt!
You think so?  I am not sure they will be as good this year?
I believe they will be all the more better!
We shall see.  How bout Lynch this year?
Lynch is ok, but I will be rooting for a different team all together this year.
Really?  Which team?
I am going for the Packers this time around.
Really?  Any player in particular?
I am not sure.
I think Tim Tee-bow will do good this year.
Tee-bow really?
Yes.
Oh ok.  I was thinking maybe someone from the Chicago Bears, like Kyle Long or Zach Miller.
Da Bearz!  Haha.  Love that Saturday Night Live Skit!
The Bears is right.
Why do you think the Bears will be winning this year
They had a good track record last seas
ea
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to represent the NFC in the super bowl?
Well Atlanta looked pretty good last year and I don't see them getting any worse.
How about the Cowboys?
With Dak Prescott and Elliot there you can never count them out.
I never saw two rookies come in and make such a big impact right away.
Plus they have a really good o-line.
The Packers should be in the mix as well.
Well when you have Aaron Rodgers you can never count them out.
Did they finally get a running back?
They had Montgomery last year, he was pretty good.
Yeah but he was a wide receiver for a while first.
He didn't do that bad with his switch, plus they drafted a few new backs.
Seattle should still be pretty good too.
Yeah they have a lot of the pieces, but that defense isn't what it used to be.
Well any of those teams could win one game.
I know it should be really interesting to see who gets the BYEs in the playoffs.
Yeah homefield advantage is huge.
I wouldn't want my team going to Lambeau in January.
Yeah for sure, the cold is a really big factor.
Yeah for sure, the regular season is going to be important for all those teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you want to watch Sunday Night football next week?
At your house?
Yes, we can order some pizza.
That sounds good. I will bring some others snacks. Who else is coming?
Just the guys and their wives and girlfriends.
Oh, ok. I will bring my wife too.
Great. My girl will be happy to have the company.
Doesn't she watch the game?
No, she could not care less about the NFL.
Oh, my wife is a huge fan. She knows the game like any man.
That's cool.
Yeah, she loves her Falcons.
Oh, that cool. Too bad they suck.
Don't say that to her.
This is going to be fun. I love messing with you falcons fans.
Yeah, it will be fun. She can dish it too.
Awesome, I can't wait.
Me either.
Text me later and we can work out any details.
Sounds good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old was Gale Sayers when he was inducted into the hall of fame?
He was 34. That's 4 years younger than Peyton Manning.
Really? I did not know that.
Do you know who the was the only coach in NFL history to average more than one playoff win in 10+ seasons of coaching?
Wasn't that Joe Gibbs?
Yeah. The Washington Redskins, right?
Yep. Gibbs had 17 playoff wins in his 16 years, and 17 in his first 12 with the Redskins.
That's quite the record.
I know. John Harbaugh currently has nine playoff wins in seven seasons.
Yeah, I heard both Bill Walsh and Jimmy Johnson had 10 playoff wins in 10 seasons too.
That's consistently a pretty good team.
I agree. I'm Green Bay fan myself.
Really, they're okay. Their team logo looks a lot some college down south, doesn't it?
It should. Vince Dooley "borrowed" the look of the "g" for the Georgia Bulldogs.
Oh that explains it. I thought I had seen it some where else.
Yeah, they say it's the highest for flattery but it was our first!
Okay, okay. You Packers fans are die hards!
They don't call us cheeseheads for nothing!
Yeah you seem like a cheddar to me!
Hey you are what you eat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite team
Patriots, I grew up in Boston
You must get sick of winning?
No,because they stunk so bad in the 80's and 90's it was sad.
How do you think they will do this year?
Anything less than a Super Bowl win is a loss.
Who did they add this year again?
They added Cooks to the Wr core and Allen as a TE. They had small adds here and there on defense but the biggest is Gilmore.
They have like 5 running backs now?
I just was reading that they might dump Lewis,sad that he hasn't regained preinjury form yet.
Will Julien E fall off this year?
I don't know he's taken some huge licks over the years, look at Welker.
Will Cooks have over 1000 receiving yards?
I would say so,but who knows? He should be close or over unless hes hurt.
Will Gronk make it through the season?
That I can't answer. I would say it points to no more than yes..
When will Brady and Belicheck retire?
I think they go out together in 2 to 3 years.
Who do you think will be their biggest threat in the AFC?
If Denver has a qb this year. it will be them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win in the NFC this year?
I'm particularly fond of the Falcons to repeat.
Do you even think the Falcons will win their own division?
Well, that might be tough for them, but they should make the playoffs and they are as dynamic as anyone.
What about on the defensive end?
They might not be able to hold their own, but who else is going to score as many points as them?
That is true, but if the Seahawks or someone similar can compete on the defensive end, they might give them trouble.
I'm still putting my money on the Falcons!
Well, what about the AFC?
The Patriots clearly have the edge, especially after getting Cooks.
He might be as dynamic as any receiver they've had since Moss.
Definitely, and a healthy Gronk can only help them.
I'm personally very fond of the Raiders.
They should be pretty dangerous too.
If Carr hadn't gone down, they might have been playing a lot further.
But, does the team live and die with Carr?
They might, but as long as he is healthy, they will be dangerous.
Well, all I can say is I'm excited for the season to start.
Me too, should be a very interesting one.
Yep, about as interesting as any year we've had in a while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember who won the Superbowl last year?
The Patriots.
Are you sure it wasn't the Seahawks?
I'm absolutely sure.
I thought the Seahawks won?
No, they were in the Superbowl though but lost.
Not sure how I have that mixed up.
Easy to do it's been a long time.
Yeah it's been some months.
Who do you think will win this year?
I think it's going to be a repeat.
You think the Patriots will win again?
I think so, you just can't beat them right now.
You're biased though.
A little sure but their statistics speak for themselves.
Fair enough.
Who do you think will win?
The Colts.
Now who is being biased.
I can only hope.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Raiders moving to Las Vegas?
It is a bone head move.
Well, it just breaks down to the money for the owners.
The teams should just stop adding the city names to branding.
It looks like they have no problem moving teams now.
It is just too much.
Business is business.
But, you have loyal fan bases.  People love those teams and to see them leave town is tough.
The nfl is huge revenue, and really, people can still turn on the tv to see the games.
There is just something different about being able to be around the team.
Yep.  When your team is in the playoffs or going to the superbowl, it is different.
You see all the people around town with their nfl team colors on.  It gets really crazy.
When the niners went to the superbowl, you could see everybody in red.  People had flags on their cars and everything.
Having a team local is big.  Watching it on tv is okay, but there is something about having them close by.
The nfl teams moving is just the way of the future.
It just sounds corny to hear the Raiders playing in Vegas.
The Las Vegas Raiders does not just roll off the tongue.
It just does not sound right.
The nfl is betting that the fans will adjust and get over it.
Some fans are not going to like it.  I guess it is just the new way things are being done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the NFL season to begin?
Can't wait! I've been dying to watch my Packers play again!
Do you think they will make it to the super bowl this year?
I'm not sure. I know they will do well, but they have a lot of young guys on defense and have a lot of work to do to get there.
I hope the Broncos make it to the playoffs. It would be fun to watch them play the Packers in the Superbowl.
I don't mind the Broncos, but they haven't been the same since Peyton Manning left.
I agree. What do you think about their new quarterback?
I don't know much about him, but I heard that he has a lot of potential.
No one will ever be as good as Aaron Rogers, am I right?
Some people could argue with that statement, I however couldn't.
What do they call Packer fans again?
Do you mean cheeseheads?
Oh yea! That's right.
I love a good cheddar. Their fans are pretty serious.
Is Lambeau field enclosed?
No, it's an outdoor stadium. It gets incredibly cold in the winter.
Oh that's right, I've heard lots of teams hate playing there in the winter due to the cold temps. Must be really hard to catch a football when it's that cold.
Yes it is. And incredibly enough, I can't remember a single game ever getting cancelled due to being too cold.
Boy the Packers must be a pretty tough team to beat.
Yup, and I can't wait to watch them in August!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whoa! Look at that!
Look at what?
A shooting star! Make a wish!
Hmmmmm....
Hmmm.....
Okay.
What did you wish for?
I wished for a lot of things.
Like what?
One is to get a gambling win in Football!
What else?
To get some good football gear!
Okay
And?
Maybe some good luck for my game tomorrow?
Oh, yeah!!
Same.
Maybe, we can catch some fireflies after the game tonight?
Perhaps, we shall take a look see.
Agreed
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for this years NFL season?
Yes, I am are you.
Ohh yea, I cant wait.
Im really looking forward to see how the raiders do.
The move to vegas should be good for the fan and the team.
I bet it will breathe some new life to the franchise.
I sure hope so.
The raiders have been mediocre for awhile.
Im also very excited about Marshawn Lynch
Me too, should be good.
Do you think the falcons can get back to the bowl.
I do, they will be tough to beat this year.
New England got pretty lucky last year.
Yes, they did.
I hope the rams can pull out of the slump,
yea, they had a lot riding on them last year.
Its time to let the rookie QB shine.
Thats why they drafted him.
Goodluck this season.
You too as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Drew Bres is going to catch Peyton Manning's touchdown reccord?
What is he, like 74 away.
Yeah he would have to throw 37 in the next two years to get it.
He's 38 years old though, and he's going to turn 39 during the season. I don't know if he'll do it.
Plus his team isn't as good as its been in the past. It might take him three seasons.
Tom Brady isn't that far beind Bres either, maybe he will break the reccord.
Tom Brady is a year and a half older though, he would have to play until hes 42 to get it.
He doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.
Anyone else close to the reccord?
Eli Manning is the next closest whos playing, but hes pretty far behind. I don't think he has a chance.
What about Aaron Rodgers?
He is about three hundred behind. I think missing those years sitting behind Favre is going to cost him a chance.
It really improved his game though.
I know, he has the best QB rating of all time.
Rivers is right up there with Eli Manning, but he probably won't get it either.
It's crazy how many people on the TD leaderboard are still playing or just retired in the last 10 years.
Teams throw a lot more now though, some teams barely run the ball unless they have to.
Dan Marino played back before all of this and he's pretty high on the list.
So did Fran Tarkenton, he had a lot of TD passes.
Imagine if those guys played today how many they would have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about football
Sounds good
I love the parties
Foot ball parties or superbowl?
Superbowl
Me too
They are a big thing with my family
Mine too
Theres always so much food
I love the food
Last yesr we had barbeque
That sounds good
It was delicious
We had chicken wings
That sounds good too
It was
I love how everyone gets together
And bonds over the game
Exactly
Its so much fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the most emotional NFL moment you witnessed?
By the far the Saints return to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
I've heard about the game but I just moved to New Orleans and it seems like everybody talks it.
Yeah it was a Monday night game in the Superdome.
Who did the Saints play?
Only our biggest rival, the dirty birds.
The Atalanta Falcons?
Yes haha. We call them the dirty birds.
Gotcha, so was that Monday night game the game when that dude blocked the punt?
Sure was and the dude is named Steve Gleason, bascially considered a hero in New Orleans.
Yeah I see people all the time wearing Gleason shirts.
Steve was diagnosed with ALS a few seasons after his historic punt block and all the shirts you see are for his charity called "No White Flags"
Oh wow, that's heartbreaking.
It's very sad but Steve's a class act, he still supports the Saints and is always on the field at any Saints home game.
I'll for sure look for him next time you take me to Saints game.
Who says I'm going to take you to any games this season?
I hope you're joking rite now.
I am I am, don't worry you can actually come to the Monday night game with me this season.
Great! Who are the Saints playing?
Vikings in the Superdome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you read sports illustrated articles on their NFL predictions?
No I haven't yet.
It's pretty interesting.
Everyone claims to be an expert.
They'res a lot of so called experts.
What are they saying?
They think the steelers,patriots and packers are the top teams.
Well they're in weak divisions.
That's a big reason.
They figure they are the only teams that can win twelve games.
I'm not sure about that.
What about the patriots or falcons?
Or how about the Giants or chiefs.
Nobody knows for sure.
There is a lot of factors.
Of course there is,such as injuries.
Right. Every team will have injuries.
The teams that have good depth will survive.
That's why the draft is so important for the depth charts.
Teams need to draft smart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Antonio Brown last year?
Are you referring to the playoffs?
Yes I am.
Yes I saw him perform, he did well.
Yes, he is my favorite player.
Why do you like him?
I like watching videos of his unique training.
Is that interesting.
Yes, especially when combined with his outstanding on field performance.
Ok that does sound interesting.
Yes he is only five foot ten also.
Yes that is shorter than average.
Yes and yet he is a protype player with a perfect body.
Yes can move so well.
Yes I like the way he moves on the field.
Yes it is great to watch.
I really enjoyed his playoff performance.
Yes he fought hard.
Yes it was quite a battle that Pittsburgh fought.
Yes it was super entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is better, Peyton or Eli?
Obviously Eli.
How can you say that?
Because Eli had two rings first.
Yea but that alone doesn't make him better.
How so?
Peyton is taller, bigger, and has more experience.
To me that just means he's slower, easier to tackle, and older.
Peyton has more yards.
Yea but that's because he played more games.
That's bull. He more touchdowns.
Again, it's because he's an older player.
How many pro bowl nominations does eli have?
3 I think.
Peyton has 12.
Ok, but what else do you have? Eli is still better in my mind.
Yea, and only in your mind. Just admit it.
Look, they are both amazing.
Ok fine, finally we agree on something.
Yea, they will both end up in the hall of fame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the NFL! Are you a fan?
Of course, it is awesome!
What is your favorite thing about the league?
I love the hard hits.  It makes the game very intense!
Really? I like watching long touchdown passes. There is nothing better than a deep bomb for a score.
Yeah, that is pretty nice. Who is the best quarterback throwing the deep ball?
Matt Ryan, hands down.
Why is that?
Have you seen the chemistry between him and Julio Jones?
Yeah, they make a great pair.
Who do you think is the best?
Drew Brees obviously!
He hasn't been great recently.
Yeah but over the past six years nobody has done it better than him.
Yeah the Saints are a very dynamic team.
Exactly.  Every game is high scoring and exciting
I think Carr will be the best eventually.
I agree, he has all the tools for success.
He just needs a better offensive line and he will be unstoppable.
I wouldn't want to be another team in the AFC West any time soon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you have for MVP this year?
I got Matt Ryan repeating again, I think the Falcons are going to have another great season.
I can see that, it is hard to win back to back though.
Who do you have for MVP?
I think Drew Brees is going to win it.
Really, why do you think he's winning it?
I think Saints are going to surprise everyone and win over 11 games and make the playoffs, and Brees will put up 5000 yards again.
I can definitely see the the 5000 yards happening, but the Saints winning that many games, I don't know.
I just have a feeling, either way it could be Brady and Rodgers too.
Yes they will always be up there, especially Aaron, the Packers are going to be very good this season.
I think so too, they are my Superbowl favorites.
Can't believe that Rodgers only has one ring, he's been the the best player for the last five years at least.
I have to agree, put him on the Patriots and they win every year.
Yeah, anybody with top 10 talent can succeed in that system.
True, I wonder if Jimmy Garoppolo is even that good, or if it was the system.
Won't know until he gets a chance to shine, we'll see.
You think anyone is about to have a comeback season?
Cam Newton, he might get the Panthers back this year.
He might, but I think he just had that one Superbowl season, I think the new young Quarter Backs are about to take over.
Yes, I am so excited about that, hopefully this will be a competitive season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Pittsburgh Steelers play dirty?
Regardless they are a successful team.
Yeah six championships since 1974 isn't to bad
Some teams go through such long droughts.
Exactly that franchise has tasted success several times.
They must want to end the current nine year drought though.
They should just focus on getting better each year.
Sure they can win next year but progress is the first step.
It all starts with improvement game by game.
Even if they have bad chemistry at the start of the season that can change.
I can't disagree with that.
Ben Roethlisberger helps their chances of success.
Yeah he has been a good Quarterback for them.
He has led them to two of their six total champions!
Wow having started his career in 2004 that is impressive.
Exactly a third of their championships in the last half century are because of him.
If he wins them another one before his career ends that would be special.
It really would be special for him and the franchise.
Well I'm excited to see the Steelers play next season.
I am also excited about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about top ranked players this 2017 NFL Season!
How about we start with quarterback of the Falcons, Matt Ryan?
Matt Ryan had a great season, one of the best of his career.
He was a threat, passing for 4,944 yards and 38 touchdowns! Those numbers being with just seven interceptions.
Yeah, the Falcons exploded with those types of numbers and enjoyed the fruits from which were produced.
But all did not end too well there. Having made it to the grand stage just for the defense to collapse.
That is all too true, though he is ranked number 10 in the top 100 of players coming into 2017 season.
We will just have to wait and see if he can build upon this past season and continue strong.
Let's turn our focus to Le'Veon Bell, the Steelers running back.
The word patience fits the man to a t.
That it does, he really showed much patience last season.
Lets not forget Bell rushed for 1,268 yards and he peaked with back-to-back 150 plus yard games in the playoffs.
Yeah, one must watch for his sudden bursts out of the backfield. Very explosive and a sight to watch.
One of his most memorable performances was in a snowstorm! Getting the ball 38 times and had 236 yards rushing with 3 touchdowns on the ground.
I remember that game! Was a great game to witness.
I would put that in one of my all time favorites of his games.
Bell is without a doubt, a top 10 player to watch!
I agree, with you on that one.
There are so many greats out there to be on the radar this season.
Yeah, and we only named off two of them! So much great talent in this league.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch the NFL football?
Yes I try to watch every Sunday.  Do you?
Most games yes.  Do you do fantasy football?
I am in 2 leagues this year.
Who's your top picks?
If I get first pick trying to decide between Leveon Bell or Ezekiel Elliiott.
Two good choices, I think I'd go with Elliott.  Young and strong.
Yeah I hope so.  Who's your top quarterback choice?
Brady is always tops or maybe Rodgers.  But depending on who's left.
Yeah, Dalton always does well for me.
I like Dalton, he has good numbers.
I think Drew Bree's days are limited.  What do you think will be top defense?
That's a tough one.  Maybe Arizona or Seattle.
Don't forget Houston Texans. JJ Watt should be back and he's a killer
Yes I've always loved JJ Watt,  he's a good guy.
Yeah I just don't care for the Texans.
Me either.  Not many people like them.  Who's their quarterback?
I think some rookie Watson. Don't know much about him.
Me either I do know Weeden is a back up.
He was a joke when he was with the Dallas Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So football season starts in just a couple more months.
I know! Time flies. I'm excited.
I wonder how the Patriots will do this year.
Well, they've got new players. They signed Conor McDermott and nearly 20 rookie free agents.
Yeah, I'm psyched about McDermott. Also Derek Rivers.
I hope Jimmy Garoppolo stays healthy.
Is he replacing Tom Brady as quarterback?
No, not replacing, but I get the sense that they'll be playing him more often.
Who are they playing in their first regular season game?
The Kansas City Chiefs.
Oh, I think that'll be an easy win for the Patriots.
Yeah, maybe. Especially since it's a home game.
The Chiefs used to be the worst team in the NFL. Hands down the worst.
I know, but that was a few years ago. They've had at least two decent seasons since then.
Well, they lost the division title two years in a row.
Have they ever won a Super Bowl?
They won one, I think.
Back in the 1960s?
1970. They beat the Vikings, who have never won a Super Bowl.
Wow. I wish I'd been around to see that matchup.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have season tickets to NFL games?
Yes, we have season tickets to see the Pittsburgh Steelers!
Really - I didn't know you were a Steeler's Fan!
Yes, my whole family is, ever since the days of Terry Bradshaw.
They have a really nice stadium in Pittsburgh, don't they?
Yes, PNC park is great, and they have a great view of the city.
I hope that they have a good season - Roethlisberger is a great quarterback.
Yeah, I'm hopeful that this will be a good year.  Bell had a descent rushing record last year.
Their kick return yardage was OK.
Sure - there is always room for improvement, but I think that Toussaint will lead in that department.
When did the Stellers last win a Super Bowl?
They last won the 2008 Super Bowl - that was a great year.
Right - when they beat the Cardinals - that was a close game too.
Indeed - and the 100 yard interception by Harrison was fantastic - we were cheering on that one!
I think that the Steeler's offense needs to be more aggresive.
Yes, some years their defense is their strongest area.
Do you ever have tickets available for the games?
Yes, sometimes I have one or two Steelers' tickets available - interesting in coming to a game!
Yes - I would love to see an NFL game live - I have not been to one in a long time.
Great - bring your Steelers' jersey!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you feel that the NFL is still the best pro sport out there?
There is no doubt about it in my opinion.
How long have you been watching the NFL?
I have probably been watching for nearly fifty years.
That is about how long my dad has been watching as well.
I have had the opportunity to watch some great football in my day, that is for certain.
My dad and me always argue about the best NFL defense of all time.
You guys sound like me and my two sons now. Who do you think had the best defense ever?
I feel that the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the best defense of all time.
They were really good, but I have to disagree with you on that one.
Who do you think had the best defense of all time?
That would be the 1976 Pittsburgh Steelers. Hands down!
Was that the Steel Curtain defense?
It sure was! I have still never seen a defense like that in my life.
That is who my dad says was the best defense ever!
He must be a smart man! At one point that season, they went twenty two straight quarters without giving up a touchdown.
That is actually a pretty amazing stat. That Buccaneers team was loaded with talent though.
Trust me, they would not even touch that 76' Steeler defense!.It was amazing!
Do you think Tom Brady could put up some points against them?
Not even if he had Jerry Rice and Randy Moss to throw to!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the NFL season!
Me too, please start again soon.
I know! I so can't wait until the opener.
I miss hearing about Cutler's mom too.
Yes, she's hilarious.
Indeed, her & the Twitter are pals.
They sometimes ask Cutler about his mom during interviews.
I bet that never gets old.
No, he's a good sport.
All the player interviews have been the highligt of my summer.
Yeah, I was stuck on ESPN all summer. You would think it was not the off season.
Do they have any new football shows?
They don't have anything new, but they do have alot of guess NFL hosts.
Who has guess hosted so far.
Well last week they had Brown & Flacco, but they had far more interesting people in the begining of the summer.
Wait, Flacco cohosted?
He has hosted at least twice now. I missed his firt time.
Is he any good?
Yeah, he did really well.
I'll have to remind myself to look out for him next time he's on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking today about first round busts in the NFL.
There are plenty of them to consume your thinking.
Yes. For sure. Wonder how many first round busts there will be this year.
It will be interesting to see. I'm guessing that Trabisky player may be a bust.
I could see that. So many quarterbacks have been busts in the past.
Akili Smith, Tim Couch, Johnnie Manziel, and the bust of all busts Ryan Leaf.
Ryan Leaf. Wow. What a shame the way his career turned out.
He brought a lot of it on himself with his attitude and locker room conduct.
For sure, but I still feel bad for the guy a little bit. Remember the choice between Leaf and Manning.
Their careers couldn't have been more polar opposite.
Imagine if the Colts picked Leaf instead.
I think it wasn't as hard of a choice as the media made it out to be. A household name, Manning, versus a guy who nobody heard of till his final year of college football.
True. I think a lot of people believed they were equally talented.
I think the talent was there with Leaf, he just never adapted to the NFL game pace.
Unfortunate. There were other big quarterback busts in the 1990s that get overshadowed.
Akili Smith. Ha ha.
Akili Smith is definitely one of them.
He was another quarterback nobody heard of until his final year of college.
The Bengals really had a lot of busts in the nineties. No wonder they haven't won a playoff game since 1991.
That's part of the reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Cardinals are the best NFL team.
Really? Why is that?
Blaine Gabbert is a great Quarterback.
Really? I think  Carson Palmer is better.
Their coach is also Bruce Arians, and hes amazing.
Yeah, I think Bruce is really cool.
So you agree with me?
No, I wouldn't say having a cool coach makes them the best team.
Well, they have a lot of other good players as well.
Yeah maybe. I just think they were a better team when they had Kurt Warner.
I can't hang in the past crying about the loss of great players like Kurt Warner or Emmitt Smith.
Yeah, I can understand that.
They really are a great team.
Do you think they will make the playoffs this year?
I really hope they do.
With a coach like Bruce I think it's very possible.
I want them to at least make a good run for it.
What would you be satisfied with?
Hmm.. At least a conference championship appearance.
I think that's a good goal for this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the best kicker in NFL History?
Definitely Adam Viniatieri. The guy was clutch.
I would have to agree with Adam Vinitatieri. Guy made two game winning kicks in the Super Bowl and kicked a 40 yarder in a snow storm in New England.
He never seemed to miss.
The guy is ancient now and is still good. He's pushing 45.
Forty-five. I would have figured he was pushing fifty. Ha ha.
Funny. He just might kick till he is fifty.
Other honorable mention kickers would be Morten Andersen and Gary Anderson.
Gary Anderson. The guy probably still can't get over that kick in Minnesota.
The guy was automatic all year and missed a 40 yarder inside the dome. So sad.
Yes, definitely a sad situation. Gary Anderson is a good guy and sometimes bad things happen to good guys.
Unfortunately.
Morten Andersen was a great kicker also. He was a left foot kicker.
That is pretty unusual in the NFL. That guy was pretty clutch also.
He played for a bad franchise his entire career. So, he didn't get too many high-pressured situations in the playoffs.
He certainly did not. The Saints were awful for most of his career.
What are some other kickers that come to mind for you? I can think of Matt Bryant and Jason Elam.
I can agree with those two. They have field goal distance records.
Elam kicked a 64 yarder a few years ago. Right?
No, that was Matt Prater. Denver always had good kickers, so it's easy to get confused.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Rams' move to LA?
I don't like it.
Why?
It's a stupid money grab.
Why? They used to be there!
Exactly! And went back to St. Louis!
So you don't think the Rams should be in LA?
I don't think ANY team should be in LA.
Why not?
It's not a football town. What happens to every team that goes there?
They leave.
Exactly! LA just doesn't care.
Then why keep trying?
It's the second-biggest market in the country.
Ah. True.
And owners think people in LA will pay more than in St. Louis.
They have a point.
They don't care about fans. You know who's gonna pay for that stadium?
The fans?
The entire city.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think are the greatest NFL defensive players ever?
Well Reggie White is great.
Yes, I agree. Any others you want to list?
Well I think that Deion Sanders and Ed Reed are up there.
They definitely dominated their respective positions.
What do you think about Dick Butkus?
I was too young, but I heard he is phenomenal.
I think his name is hilarious.
Me too, but he could hit very very hard I hear!
This is probably true. The dude is a hall of famer.
Who are current players that will be in the hall of fame?
Defense or offensive players?
Start with defense.
Well JJ Watt is up there, and I think that Patrick Peterson will someday be up there, too.
What about offensive players?
Well obviously Brady.
Any more?
I think that Larry Fitgerald and AJ Green will eventually be there.
Any running backs?
Well, I think that Marshawn Lynch has a very good shot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Steelers are headed nowhere fast
Why do you think that?
Big Ben is going to break down more and more
Yeah but they take the pressure off him with Leveon Bell
I dont think he is going to perform well
I think so, he just got paid
And thats why I think we see the end of his career come quicker than you think
No he has shown he has the skills needed to produce in this league
What happens though if he gets injured
All guys deal with that
Running backs normally dont see big paydays
Yeah but you gotta pay the ones who are workhorses
I think you let them go in free agency
Someone would give them a job
Maybe, but you dont committ to it.
So you think the Cowboys are going to let Elliot go?
No but they should
How can you say that he was a rookie of the year could have been an MVP
They got McFadden to 1000 yards the year before. Its all about the line.
I dont agree. You pay an elite back because there are not alot of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
It's fun to watch!
I agree!
Do you have a favorite team?
Yea, the BIlls!
Oh?
Yea I'm hopeful for this season
They seem to have a better lineup
I'm hoping so!
Yea it's not looking to bad!
Did you see who their new coach is?
Yea, he's not looking too shabby!
Better than the last one!
I'm hoping so!
Well it's been great talking to you!
You too man
Talk to you later
Bye!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Browns will be improved this season?
I mean... they loaded up on draft picks. They should be better.
You would THINK they would be.
Yeah, it's hard to be confident in them though.
They always seem to do poorly every season.
It's because their old management staff kept messing things up.
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how their new staff does.
We shall see. They can't do any worse than the old regime.
Only way they would be worse is if they went winless this coming season.
That's hard to do.
Yeah. I feel bad for the Chargers losing to them last season.
Suprise of the season.
Chargers also need a reboot.
That team is literally up and down every season.
Philip Rivers is a gun slinger.
He reminds me of Brett Favre.
Yeah, he chucks the ball.
He makes a lot of mistakes too. I like his hustle though.
You can't teach that.
That's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pick a dark horse NFL championship matchup.
Ooooh, fun. The crappy teams making it.
No, the better-than-expected teams that are going to come through out of nowhere.
You mean only making it because of Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers getting injured?
Sure.
Hmm...
And don't say the Browns to be a troll.
Dang! How'd you know?
You're predictable. Go ahead.
I choose the Bills and Bengals.
Try again?
Excuse me?
They're in the same conference, so they wouldn't be in the championship.
You said championship, not Super Bowl. I'm assuming the AFC championship.
Fine, why those two?
Both have been somewhat solid teams the last few years but fell short.
They have such a bad history the last 25 years, though
Right? They're due. Bengals haven't won a playoff game since 91, I think, and the Bills haven't been to the title game since their 4-peat of being losers.
I'm going for the Colts and Eagles in the SUPER BOWL.
Eagles have no chance! They're irrelevant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the latest news on Ryan Tannehill?
I haven't heard anything.
You know he injured his knee in December?
Yes, but I don't think he had surgery.
Did he need surgery?
No, they did some rehab so he should be ready in the fall.
I saw the game where he was injured.
I missed it.
He was hit by Pace from the Jets.
That's no good.
Pace was uncovered he hit, Tannehill pretty hard.
It had to be, he was out for the rest of the season.
He's strong. The Dolphins training camp starts soon and I'm sure he'll be there.
I'm certain.
If not they got Matt Moore.
For another year.
Is his contract up?
This is the last year on it.
I'm sure he'll re-sign.
Sure he will.

Hard to believe football starts in less than two months.
It comes up quickly.
It seems like yesterday I was,watching the SUPERBOWL.
I hear you there.
What do you think of the packers chances of making the SUPERBOWL.
As long as they have Aaron Rodgers anything is possible.
He's something else isn't he?
That's putting it mildly.
I've never seen a quarterback throw so many successful Hail Mary passses in my life.
I know,usually if you do it once in your career it's good.
He's done,it several times already.
Everyone of them were in a huge game.
How is there schedule this year?
They've got some tough games.
Who do they open with?
They open at home with the Seahawks.
That'll be a good game.
They also have the falcons away,the Cowboys away,the steelers away and the saints at home.
That's not an easy schedule.
No it's not
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tom Brady is a very good quarterback.
The Patriots are lucky to have him.
His record is really good.
How many touchdowns has he thrown his whole career?
I am unsure there is a lot.
How many did he make last season?
He had 28 touch downs last season.
wow that is alot!
Yeah he had very few interceptions to though.
How many did he have?
He only had two interceptions all year!
wow amazing!
Ii am not sure who Patriots coach is though.
Bill Belichick is the coach.
Oh yeah, not I remember he is a good coach. I wonder how long he has been coaching them.
He is in his 18th season with the New England Patriots.
Wow. Amazing.
I agree and he has been involved with the NFL for 42 seasons.
That is awesome to be an NFL coach Consistency and wins is amazing.
It is incredible
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Chargers are going to win the west this year.
No way, the Raiders are by far the better team. I think they will win it all.
The Chargers are healthy and Bosa going into his second year is going to be a beast on defense.
I don't think the Chargers can stay healthy though. Look at the Raiders with Carr at QB they are just too good.
They aren't going to look that good when Bosa sacks Carr at least twice both games.
You're crazy! Also, the Chargers just moved to that tiny stadium in LA and most of their fan base jumped ship.
I think they will do better in a smaller place and those guys are hungry for a championship. They will have more than enough fans in LA trust me.
The Chargers have been hungry and they always choke.
I'm telling you, this is their year. Rivers finally has some protection from the line and great true receivers to throw to.
I think Rivers deserves a super bowl ring I just don't think the Chargers are going to get him one.
We'll see where they're at mid-season, I really think you're going to be surprised. Rivers is going to get what he's worked so hard for.
They aren't going to beat the Raiders though, they are just too tough. Look at that defense from last year they were beasts.
I think the Raiders are overrated and its going to show this year.
Overrated? Youu must be joking. Did you see we signed Lynch in the off-season. Beastmode!
He's old and should have retired. Hope he enjoys getting planted by Bosa and crew every game.
You'll see Lynch is going to put up huge numbers and run all over everybody.
I don't see it happening, not in this division. I think you're going to see Gordon put up bigger numbers.
Gordon got lucky last season. Do you not remember his rookie year?
Oh, I remember. He was awesome last year and he's only going to get better.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My Cowboys couldn't pull through last night.
I know, I saw it. It was a close game.
Yea, to lose by 1 measly point.
The whole game kept me on the edge of my seat.
Prescott will have to play better than that next time.
Yea, how many yards did he have?
Prescott had 227 yards.
What was his QB rating?
It was only about 60.2.
Yea, that may explain why they lost.
I think it came down to the Giants' defense.
Yep they kept the middle shut down all game.
It was really difficult for Elliott to get any rushing yards.
How many yards did Elliot have anyway?
He only had 51 yards on 20 carries.
Well, that's definitely not good.
Yep, and Dallas' top receiver only had 66 receiving yards.
That's crazy. What was the final score if you remember?
Giants beat my Cowboys 20 to 19. I'm sad now.
Well, I guess they will have better luck next time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how good is your NFL trivia?
Hmmm, I think it's pretty good. Test me!
Ok, How long do you think it would take for you to get Green Bay Packers tickets if you were on the waiting list today?
Those Packers fans are fanatics! Probably a very long time but I don't know exactly.
You would have to wait almost a 1,000 years! There are approximately 86,000 people on it. With under 100 people giving up their tickets per year!
That's insane! Okay hit me up again.
Wilson has been making the official foot ball since 1941...do you know how many footballs they make per day?
Oh I got this! It's about 4,000 per day or one for every Eli Manning interception.
Ah, good one! How about which NFL ever three-peated and never once in the Super Bowl Era?
Back to those Packers! Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers of 1966-68 won three NFL championships in a row, but no team has ever pulled off the feat in the Super Bowl era.
Right you are!
This is fun. Keep going.
Ok, what days of the week does the NFL play?
Sunday, Monday and Thursday?
Nope, they actually have played every day of the week. Games have been moved because of holidays and weather.
Really? I did not know that.
Ok, how much doest that Superbowl trophy cost?
It's a lot of metal. I'm going to say $20k?
Wrong again? It's $25K.
Dang, that was fun we'll have to do that again!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Leveon Bell will stay healthy this season?
I sure do hope so. He is my favorite running back.
You like him more than Adrian Peterson?
Yes, I do. I like and respect Adrian Peterson though.
I would really like to know who is faster between Leveon Bell and Antonio Brown.
My money would be on Antonio Brown.
I would have to give it to Leveon Bell.
Why do you say that?
In my eyes, running backs always seem to be faster than wide receivers.
That may be true. It is their job to run after all.
That and the fact that wide receivers are agile when it comes to cutting.
I wonder who some of the best downhill running backs in the NFL are.
Same here, I don't really pay too much attention to running backs.
Me neither, except for the new boss Ezekiel Elliott.
Yeah, Ezekiel Elliott is awesome both athletic and personality wise.
Have you seen his hit on Kam Chancellor after Kam Chancellor blindsided him?
No, I haven't what happened?
After Chancellor hit him, after a play, Elliott was running the ball and dropped a shoulder into Chancellor.
I bet that hurt, Chancellor is the bigger guy.
True, but Elliott sent him a pretty good distance backwards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you still a big NFL fan?
Yes, I am really looking forward to the upcoming season.
I am to, I can not wait to set down and watch some football.
What team do you cheer for the most?
I am a huge New Orleans Saints fan!
I have always been a big fan of Drew Brees myself actually.
Yea, I hope he never retires!
He has been great for the Saints in every aspect.
He sure has; he saved our franchise in my honest opinion.
I remember watching him in college when he played for Purdue. I could tell he was going to be special.
Yea he had a great college career as well.
I feel that him and Sean Payton have been a perfect match together.
They have great chemistry with one another. It reminds me of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady in some ways.
Do you think he will be able to win another Superbowl before he retires?
I sure hope so. I would love that for so many reasons!
Well, at least he has one ring to silence the critics.
Yea, I am happy that he does not have to worry about retiring without it!
I feel that if he had better defenses over the years he would have gotten a few more of those rings.
I agree with you one hundred percent about that!
Without a great defense it is hard to win in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?!?
Hell yeah!
What are you looking forward to the most this season?
Honestly, I'm more into the fantasy football aspect of it than anything else.
Oh really? Big gambler?
We don't even place money. Just general competitive spirit.
Oh that's cool. I'll occasionally play but I like to put a little extra money on it to keep it interesting - at least lose buys lunch sort of thing.
Ah I could get into that. Might have to play with you this year.
You should. Where do you play now?
One of the online communities I belong to sets up a league each year.
So you're not into it at all for the actual sport?
Oh I am it's just not my biggest reason for following. I used to watch college football and basketball almost religiously.
Oh? Who'd you follow?
University of Oklahoma, of course!
Really? Thought most from your town were Oklahoma State fans.
They are... but they don't know any better. Actually my whole family supports OU so I just sorta grew up into it.
Cool cool. My family were big Kansas State fans so I guess it's pretty much the same for me.
Gotta love family. I actually follow pro more now and the Kansas City Chiefs are on my top three teams.
Shouldn't be a surprise but they're my number one pro team. What's your other two faves?
Dallas Cowboys because of similar family reasons, but it's a close tie between Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about this year's NFL Draft?
I didn't watch a lot of it. It takes way too long.
I mean the picks.
Well, the first pick wasn't surprising. I expected Myles Garrett to go first.
From what I read, I think he did too!
I think you are right. The most surprising to me was that Mitchell Trubisky ended up going second.
That seems like a big risk for the Bears.
I think so. But clearly they saw something in him!
What do you think about Jabrill Peppers?
Personally, I recognize he is an amazing athlete, but I think he's overrated.
Really? He can play all sides of the ball.
Which may be great in college, but will that work for the NFL?
I don't know. I guess the Browns will find out.
The Browns need all the help they can get!
They've been so bad the last few years. How many picks did they have this year in the first round?
I think they ended up with three first round picks.
Their quarterback situation is still such an unknown.
That is the truth! They have Osweiler who himself is a big question mark.
I know and I don't know that their backups will offer much.
Well, I don't even think they know who their backups are yet. They haven't picked a starter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know much about the NFL?
A little, why?
I've never been much of a fan, but you seem like the type. What are some interesting facts about them?
Did you know that it is virtually impossible to get season tickets for the Green Bay Packers?
No, I didn't.
In fact, you would have to be on the waiting list for almost 1000 years to get your tickets.
That's carzy. Hit me with another one.
Okay, how many footballs do you think Wilson, the sporting goods company, makes per day?
I don't know, I would guess about 50 thousand.
Well, the answer is four thousand. A single cow yields only 10 balls.
That's fascinating.
Do you know that no football team has ever won the Superbowl three years in a row?
I believe that.
However, the Packers won three championships before the Superbowl era.
That's ironic for them.
Yes, it is.
How much is the NFL trophy worth?
The dollar value of the trophy is about 25 thousand.
That's all? What else can you tell me?
Carl Weathers, known as Apollo Creed from the Rocky movies, was an NFL player. He played for the Oakland Raiders.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to take my Dad to see the Browns this year.
Will you go to Cleveland?
Probably. It's nice there.
I've never been to their stadium.
They're playing Pittsburgh in September.
That would be a game to see.
Yes, but the Browns will get killed in that game.
Maybe they would surprise you.
I would hope so.
Hue Jackson really needs to lay in to those guys.
Yes, but seems the Browns just can't get into a game.
I know. Some of the games were pitiful last year.
Maybe the Browns will have a trun around like the Indians did.
Yes, they have been doing good.
Maybe Kevin Hogan will throw some outstanding passes for them this year.
I'll keep my fingers crossed for your Dad.
Their total rushing yards are pretty low as a team.
Their statistics aren't that great, are they?
Not really, but I guess they could be worse.
True. Well, I hope you get to go to the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win this year?
Well I think the Patriots are the top of the list. What about you?
Ehhh, I think that's an easy pick, but I'm going with a darkhorse, the Dolphins.
What? Why?
Look at what they did last year.
Like what? Lose in the first round of the playoffs?
After getting there for the first time in 7 years or so.
Yea, so what?
They did that with a rookie head coach.
That's not that impressive, that happens a lot.
Yea but then they signed all the core players that got them there and added on in the off season.
I still don;t see why you're putting them in Superbowl contention.
Well I said they were my dark horse pick, I think they will surprise everyone.
I think you're crazy and they won't even make the playoffs this year.
I think you're underestimating a good team.
They are not a good team.
So making the playoffs means you're not a good team?
No, losing in the first round after a wildcard berth does.
Well not every team cheats like the Patriots.
Cheat or not, they still win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Cleveland browns are as bad as everyone says?
Yes,I think they are going to be pretty bad again.
Who is the starting quarterback?
I think it's going to be Brock Osweiler myself.
I agree with you.
They have strengthened the offensive line.
Yes they did.
I'm thinking they only win 4 maybe 5 games.
That seems to be the general consensus.
They should be more competitive though.
They have to be somewhat better than last year.
If they win two games they are better.
That's a great point.
How is,their schedule?
It looks pretty soft.
Well they open at home with the steelers.
Well that's not a good start.
No,they should lose that one.
Then they have the ravens,colts,bengals and jets in a row.
Definitely some winnable games there
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best Quarterback of all time?
My favorite is John Elway, but best of all time is probably Tom Brady.
So you like Tom Brady?
No, I hate him with a passion.
But you say he is the best of time.
That statement is based on his merit not how I feel about him.
Why dont you like Brady?
Because I am a Bronco fan. Denver and New England have a lot of play off history.
The patriots also have the best coach of all times.
Yes that would be hard to debate against him.
He was way better than any Bronco coach.
Well the Patriots defensive coach was a Denver head coach and destroyed the team, so.....
Denver was just a horrible team.
We had some of the best prospects that he fired.
Brandon Marshall and Jay Cutler?
Yes, those two.
They were no good.
They are better than you could have ever been.
But im not a professional athlete.
Exactly, why are talking like this?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the top NFL teams will be this year?
The Patriots will definitely be one of them.
Yes.  I think so for sure.
They are coming off a big high in winning the superbowl.
Yes that is very true.
But you know what?  They have been one of the top teams for like the last 10 years.
Yes.  They are either in the Superbowl or the conference final to go to the Superbowl most years.
Yep the Brady and Belichick duo is pretty good.
They are pretty much a dynasty team right now.
I think they have most of the core players coming back for this season so I don't see their winning ways changing.
The only thing is they had a chip on their shoulder for the last few years.
Yes, with the deflategate scandal.
Exactly.  I wonder if they will have a little less fire now that they silenced the critics with a Superbowl win.
I don't know. I think Brady is so mad he will have a chip on his shoulder for the rest of his career.
I think you are right.  He probably will try to win ever year until he retires to prove a point.
He's like forty so he does not have that many years left.
He's in freakishly good shape but you are right.  40 is pushing the limit.
I am thinking 2 to 3 years max.
As long as he can play at a high level I think he should play.
Yes.  I agree he should play and win more championships as long as he can.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Patriots are going to do this year?
I think they will dominate the NFC east again.
Do you think Brady will play much longer?
I think the way he is going he has another five maybe ten years left before he retires
Wow he'll almost be old enough for Social Security by then won't he.
Maybe... like he would need it.
You got to love the guy
Yeah I'm jealous!
What's not to envy five rings and a supermodel for a wife.
The only thing I have over him is my wife lets me eat junk food
We all have to have one fault.
I don't know if I could do his diet and life style but it sure works for him
Yeah he's in better shape than when he was in his twenties.
Yeah and you won;t see him doing Papa John's commercials.
But you know Peyton Manning made a lot of money shilling pizzas and he owns a couple of those Papa John's franchises in Denver
They were great competitors and I always loved watching them play against each other.
I was happy that Peyton won his last game.
Yeah a Super Bowl win what a way to go out and retire.
Class... they both had class.
And they both spoke highly of each other.  That's the way it's supposed to be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think any teams that didn't make the playoffs will this year?
I think some teams have improved enough.
Which teams do you think are better.
I think the chargers will be better.
Really? The chargers?
They were 1-8 in games decided by a touchdown or less.
If they win even half of those games they're in the hunt.
Plus they started out 1-4.
It's always tough battling back from a bad start.
You're always seeming to try to climb out of a hole.
Philip Rivers is a good quarterback.
I agree with you.
Things have got to turn his way eventually.
He's overdue for some good luck.
The team bolstered the line in front of him for this year.
Two of their three top picks for the offensive line.
Forrest lamp and Dan feeney could wind up starting.
Yes they could.
Russell Okung from Denver might not be as bad as he looked with the broncos.
He provides depth.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What positions are in NFL football?
I believe the main positions are quarterback, running back, fullback, offensive line, tight end, and wide receiver.
Are there any other positions that are part of the game?
There is also the defensive line, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.
I thought each team would have a kicker for field goals.
Yes, there is a kicker, punter, and return specialists.
What about the scoring in NFL football?
The game is played in four quarters with a half time.
Why do the yard lines matter then?
It is based on a down system that gives a team four chances to get ten yards and then start again.
Now I understand the term "three and out" which I have heard at an NFL game.
Yes, this means the team advancing the ball did not make the ten yards and must punt the ball in the opposite direction towards the other team.
Is it true that many NFL commentators where once football players themselves?
Yes, I think it gives them a certain expertise when they are making calls and commenting on the game.
Speaking of making calls, what about the referees in the game?
I believe they have a tough job but are compensated well.
How many officials are part of the NFL for the 2017 season?
There are approximately one hundred twenty-four.
How many owners are there for the thirty-two teams in the NFL?
There are over forty as some have multiple family owners and one is controlled by a board of directors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season!
I know man. It is going to be awesome.
I just watched a video on some of the best receivers.
That's cool. Did Julian Edelman make the list?
He did, but I am unsure why.
What do you mean?
Well, I haven't really seen him make too many great catches.
But he had an awesome SuperBowl catch! A nearly impossible catch!
True, but that is one play and I don't feel as if a play defines a player.
You're right. I like him though.
I like Edelman too but Malcolm Mitchell is my favorite Patriots receiver.
What? No way. Why?
We went to the same university and I respect his work
Oh, okay. That's understandable.
Also, I think that it is amazing that he made it to the Patriots fresh out of college.
Yeah, it is pretty amazing. He is really good.
I like Amari Cooper, from the Raiders, too. He went to the University of Alabama.
Oh, nice! That's where Julio Jones went.
Yeah, they have an awesome football program.
Nick Saban, the coach, is awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think I am gonna miss Tony Romo this year?
With all the injuries I can not believe you just said that.
No really though I think he was the glue that kept that team together.
You think that is the reason everyone seems to be getting into mischief more now that before?
I think he was the glue that kept the locker room stable.
He was good to Dak on the sidelines last year.  He is a stand up guy that is for sure.
Dak is just so young at 23.  Those older guys are not gonna want to listen to him.
That is for sure.  I think the older guys are gonna laugh at the "kid" trying to play grownup.
Jones is not gonna help stablize the team it is up to the Quarterback.
The quarterback is always the strong leader of the team.
I can not wait to see him at camp this year.
I think I am more interested in watching Zeke this year and the chemistry those two have.
Pre season starts his year with the cardinals.
Starting with a team out of the West is starting it off with a bang!
I think the Cardinals will be a easy starting game.
I don't think so.  I think they will have a strong team this year and the Cowboys better be ready.
I think they have a good chance in making playoff's this year.
If they can carry the East I think it will set them up for a good chance!
Is it Sunday night foot ball time again?
I am ready for some chips and salsa and sunday night lights!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Falcon's chances this year?
I think they look good to win their division.
Do you see a possible Super Bowl run?
Possible, but I wouldn't bet on it.
Why not?
They have too many holes in their defense.
Makes you wish Deion Sanders could show up.
Only if "Prime Time" was in his prime.
I always thought he was a bit overrated.
He knew how to market himself.
What kind of record do you see them having?
Well, I'm thinking 10-6.
Wow, that's all?
There are some improved teams in their division.
I think they could win 12 games.
It's a possibility.
Do you think they will ever win it all in our lifetime?
I sure hope so.
You never know in pro football.
This is true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the upcoming NFL season?
I sure am. What are you most excited about?
I want to see how the Atlanta Falcons will be.
Why are they your favorite team?
They are not my favorite, but they blew a big lead in the Super Bowl last year and I want to see how they respond.
What happened to them in the Super Bowl?
They were leading 28-3 and lost to the Patriots.
The Patriots are my favorite team.
I enjoy watching them too especially Tom Brady.
He turns 40 next month, so it will be interesting how well he plays.
40 is an old age for a quarterback.
Yes and he signed a contract that will keep him active till he is 42.
Do you think he will break any records?
Maybe not this season, but I think he will break some records.
Who do you want to win the Super Bowl?
I want to see the Patriots repeat.
Are there any other teams you want to see?
I would like to see the LA Rams do better this year because that is my hometown.
I want to see the Jets play because they are my hometown team.
That is the one team I do not like to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Giants v Rams games last year?
The one in London?
Yes, that one.
I thought it was great.
I think the Saints versus the Falcons was my favorite of the season
that was a fun matchup
The saints V the panthers was a terrible game though
Oh I know.
They both only got like 900 yards combined.
both the giants and the ravens were fun to watch last season
they have great quarterbacks.
I like that the panthers gave the raiders a run for their money
what was the score on that game?
32-24 I think
The saints gave the raiders a good game too
maybe next year those teams will do better
we can only hope
the nfc south has been dismal
I think the Panthers are going to pull out a better season
me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My boyfriend loves the NFL!
Just about everyone I know loves to watch football. Do you like it?
Yes, I like it more now that my boyfriend has explained the game to me.
What team does he like?
He likes the Dallas Cowboys best.
Is that your favorite team too?
Yes, for now it is because that is the team I have watched the most but I may choose another team at a later date.
I don't really watch football much because I don't have live television.
My boyfriend says that games on television are better than live games because they show the replay in slow motion.
I understand that but wouldn't a live game be really exciting?
I suppose so but it's so expensive I don't think I'd ever really go.
You could get tickets to a Cowboys game for your boyfriend for Christmas. He'd love that!
That's a good idea. He has all kinds of Cowboys memorabilia.
Like what?
A steering wheel cover and floor mats for his truck, shirts, and even a seat from the old stadium that his Dad bought him for his Birthday.
What in the world does he do with that?
Honestly it is just sitting in his closet collecting dust.
What a silly waste of money!
No, it means a lot to him that his Dad thought to buy him something he would like. They aren't close but he wishes they were.
Well I guess that is nice then, but I wouldn't want that old thing in my house!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't understand your obbession with the NFL.
I don't have an obesseion.
You watch every game you possible can.
Yes, I like the game.
You more than like it. You are crazy about it.
It is fun for me to watch. It is my release.
Well, I think it is dumb.
You are entitled you your opinion.
I thikn you need to back off of it for a while.
Well, I am not going to stop watching football.
I will leave if you don't.
You will leave if I don't stop watching the NFL?
Yes, I will.
That is what sounds dumb. I am not cheating or lying to you about anything.
I know, but I feel neglected.
Watch it with me.
I don't want to.
I don't know what to tell you.
Tell me that you will stop.
I will just help you pack.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Falcons this year?
It's a long season. But I think they'll get at least through the first round of the playoffs. How about you?
It's rough. Competition gets harder. But if Matt Ryan's healthy. I think they have a shot of getting back to the Super Bowl.
Yeah. He was on fire in the playoffs. No picks. What? Seven touchdowns?
Something like that. The problem may still be the D-line.
Yeah. Even with the off-season pick-ups.
No matter what, it'll be cool to play in the new stadium.
Mercedes-Benz?
Yup. I mean, that thing is going to be great. Retractable roof and all.
Yeah. I'm going to try to get to a home game, for sure.
What did you think about retiring Vick's jersey?
I'm okay with that.
Me, too. I feel like the haters who want to punish him forever. That's just not right.
Agreed. Plus, you know, he just electrified Atlanta. Outside the dog stuff, you know, he was good for football.
For sure, running QBs definitely make the game for exciting.
Yup. I cringe every time one takes off, because, you know, the risk of injury seems so high for these guys.
Yeah. But that's part of what makes it so exciting.
Then you've got folks like Roethlisberger who just sit in the pocket and take on all comers
He's a beast.
Funny. For sure, but I'll always judge him worse than I do Vick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the top prospect for Penn State this year?
I'm not sure but it's going to be an awesome season.
Is the Big Blue Band playing some awesome tunes.
You bet.
They must be ready for a great season.
They sure pump up the spirit.
Yep, what's football without a band?
It wouldn't be the same.
Wouldn't it be awesome if Penn State went undefeated?
You bet!
Has it ever been done?
I'm not sure but it would be incredible.
If any team could do it, it would be Penn State.
Yeah, or Florida State.
They both have rockin teams.
I know.
How did they get so good?
They have top talent.
Everyone wants to play for PSU.
Most people are really interested in PSU.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened during the Rams and Patriots game last night?
Oh, the Patriots won the game.
Did you catch the final score?
Yes, the Patriots had 26 points while the Rams only got 10 points.
Well, I'm not too surprised by the score.
Yea, the Rams appeared to be scared during the first half.
Why do you say that?
Because they didn't score any points at all.
Wow, not even a field goal?
Nope, they could barely move the ball down the field.
How many yards did the Rams get from running the football?
A whole 36 yards.
That's sad. Did they do better with receiving?
Somewhat, they had 161 receiving yards.
How many yards did Brady pass for on the Patriots?
Brady had 269 passing yards.
How did the Patriots do in running the football?
They did much better than the Rams with 133 yards.
Oh, I see. Later on, I'll check the highlights on the internet.
Yeah, you can but you didn't miss anything important.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, so you see how the deflated football incidents with the Pats, right?
Yeah.
What if someone paid the Pats to do that?
NO WAY. They debunked that stuff a long time ago.
Okay, sure. But what if there was someone behind it, and not the Patriots?
You're overthinking this a little bi.
I mean, come on! Sure, the Patriots wanna win the Super Bowl badly!
Yeah, but that doesn't justify how someone else could be behind the deflated balls.
Think about it, though!
Ugggh, I'm not so sure, man.
Well, who else could have done it, then?
Someone in the football team, obviously not among the players!
NOOO, dumb-nut! I meant the mastermind behind it all!
Uhhhh, I don't think there's anyone behind the incident.
Dude, why you gotta be so stubborn sometimes?
Well, that's me, man.
Whatever, so who do you think is an alright thrower?
Kaepernick's pretty good.
Who else?
Wanna watch Aaron Rodgers throw at practice?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you psyched about the football season coming up?
Yeah, not soon enough!
How do you think your team would do?
Well, I think they'll do good. You know, the titan's still a young team and there are lots of talents...
Yeah, the QB is good. What was his name?
Marcus Mariota.
Oh, yeah, didn't he get hurt?
Yup, he broke his leg, but he should be good now. He's a young one.
From Hawaii, right? Who'd have thought...
I know, right? He is good though.
Yeah, the Titans kind of surprised us all.
I think there's a good chance for us this season.
I hope the same for mine...I don't know though. We will need some new players.
What was your team again?
Cardinals. Our main players are kind of getting old.
Yeah, is Palmer still playing?
He is. He's okay but he always chokes though...
Haha...at least he doesn't cry like some of them.
Yeah, like Campbell...
No kidding!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's the deal with football anyway?
What do you mean?
Like, why is everyone so obsessed with it?
Well, it's a pretty universal game. I don't know why American Football has taken hold the way that it has, but football goes back hundreds of years and crosses all kinds of cultures.
Oh, right. They call soccer "football" outside the US, don't they.
Well, sort of. "Soccer" is short for "Associated Football", and it's the most popular football variant outside of the US, so everyone else tends to use the genericized term.
Wait, you mean they're actually the same game? Football and Soccer?
Sort of, but... back it up. There's a game called Football, right, and there are a zillion parallel versions of it that people play.
But which one came first?
None... of them? I mean, there must be a common ancestor, but all of the variant rulesets sprang up at around the same time in different isolated pockets.
So... okay, variant rulesets. So they really are all the same game; just, different groups of people chose to use slightly different rules for some reason?
That's what I've been saying, right. It's mostly a university thing, you know.
You mean different schools used different sets of rules for Football?
Basically, right. And different schools had different influence, so their variants spread more readily than others, until we reached a few standardized sets that most people recognize.
You say a few. What other kind of football is there?
Well, you know Rugby.
Right. Oh, right -- so that's actually football, then? I've always thought of it as, sorta, halfway between football and soccer.
That's more or less what it is... except, rephrase it for me.
Rephrase it? Like, it's a variant of football halfway between Associated Football and American Football?
By Jove, I think he's got it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
ready for your steelers
so ready, i need football
now it is time to go back to the field
yeah, i am happy for the penguins but i want football
i feel better this year
yeah, we are going to go all the way again
yes, it has been to long and ben is gettting old
may be time for a change,
agreed, anyone seem good to replace him
no, i want a new player
someone in college look good
i have not paid that much attention
same, lets keep ben for now
yeah, like it is your choice
sometimes i feel like i am a better choice than mike
no he is doing ok
not winning is not ok
you want too much
i want another ring
so does ben, hope it is our year
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the packers?
Yes i really like the green bay packers
Same, they are a good team
Their coach is pretty good too
Mile mccarthy?
Yes him
He is
I cant believe their last championship was in 2011
I know
6 years ago
I hope they win another superbowl soon
Me too
That would be awesome
It really would
Their last championship before that was 1997
So they are due for one soon
Yes
They usually win one about every ten years
Pretty much
I hope this is their year
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could play for any NFL team which would it be?
Keep asking questions to try and guess.
Is it a team in a warm place?
It is a team in a warm climate.
Do they play in the American Football Conference or the National Football Conference?
They play in the American Football Conference.
Is their mascot an animal or something else?
Their mascot is an animal.
Would you want to play for the Miami Dolphins?
Yes that is right!
Nice I got it on the first try.
Yeah I always wanted to live in Miami when I was a kid.
Is there any reason besides that?
I also love dolphins and the beach.
Wow so you chose your team for selfish reasons!
Why what team would you play for?
The Buffalo Bills because my family have been fans since they started in 1960.
Wow that is a long time.
Yeah it would be great to play for them and win them a superbowl.
Well we can only dream unfortunately!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big football fan?
I used to watch when I was younger but not anymore.
Who was your team when you used to watch?
I was a diehard Cowboys fan my whole life and still am even though I don't really watch it.
I grew up in Vikings territory so I'm a Vikings fan.
Oh man I am a Viking hater.
Really, how come?
I just got sick of everyone liking them because they are the local team even though they don't like football.
So kind of like how you like the Cowboys even though you don't watch football.
Not really, I used to like football and watch it every week and I just stuck with my team.
That makes sense I guess. Why don't you watch anymore?
When I watched I got really into it and it took up all of my time and I just needed a break.
So do you still watch occasionally then?
Once in a while I will watch a game, like on Thanksgiving or if I'm with friends who are watching.
Yeah it is always fun to go to the bar and watch with friends.
I don't drink anymore so I don't go to the bar and watch football. If I am going to watch it will be at a house.
Well we watch at my place every Sunday if you want to stop by you sure can.
I might have to come over and watch the Cowboys beat the Vikings.
Oh that will never happen.
We may have to make a friendly wager on it then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Bengals ever Fire Marvin Lewis?
I hate to say it but no
And what is your reason for that?
Because he is black.
Plenty of black coaches have been fired
Yes youre right but none in Cincinatti
So they are afraid of firing him?
No I think they just dont want to really win
I dont follow your logic
Think about it, he gets them competitive and hes a minority coach
Oh ok I see, so its semantics.
Absolutely and its pretty sad.
Yeah cant he see hes just a puppet?
Would you turn down an NFL job?
If I was just a puppet, yeah.
Wrong, youd keep it especially if there were no expectations
Yeah you are right about the expectations part
Think about it, as long as he shows up he aint getting fired.
So hes the black Bill Belichick
Without any of the successes hes had, yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hear that Ezekiel Elliot is ready to up his game this season.
That's scary. He is a beast.
Yeah, between him and Dak things are looking good for the Cowboys.
I think they'll be in the Superbowl this year.
Yeah, hard to see New England repeating but then again I said that last y ear.
Tom Brady still gets it done.
Crazy to think that the Pats did it in spite of all the injuries.
They just plug whoever into Belichik's system.
I think things get a lot tougher for the Falcons this year.
Yeah, they benefited from an easy schedule last season.
Who else do you see challenging?
Maybe Seattle?
Houston is an interesting team.  They have most of the parts
That's been true for Houston for several years though.
Who else do you think cou ld surprise?
My real dark horse is Miami, they just need to find a way to move the chains on offense.
I could see the Raiders breaking out this year.
True, solid team at every position.
Who falls off the most this year?
I think Denver continues to slide.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are the Carolina Panters going to turn it around this year?
What a difference last year was compared to the year before.
They were unstoppable until the Super Bowl.
I like Cam Newton but he takes a beating out there.
He sure does.  That is not good for longetivity in the NFL.
Look at Tom Brady he barely runs and has been around for years.
I think he is 40, or close.
Peyton Manning was the same way.
Well I can't wait for the season to kick off.
What teams do you follow?
I like the Dolphins and Arizona Cardinals.
I don't know much about the Dolphins, but I do like Arizona.
The Dolphins haven't been the same since Marino left.
They have had a hard time finding his successor.
That and they play in the Patriots division.
That's tough because if you have good season it's probably still not as good as the Patriots.
Well now Arizona's division has gotten tougher with the emergence of Seattle.
I like their defesnse it's old school.
I know they don't back down from anyone and are intimidating.
They remind me of the Bears defense in the 80's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the NFL season to start.
Me, too! It seems like the months between February and August have nothing else to watch.
What do you think about the St. Louis Rams moving to LA?
It really felt to me like a betrayal to their fans. I think they should have stayed in Missouri.
Who do you think will win the NFC West this year?
For sure it will be the 49ers.
You are crazy. Did you see them last year?
I think they're going to be starting Brian Hoyer this year as qb, and they'll be fantastic.
For sure the Seahawks will win the division.
No way. Since Russell Wilson got married and had a kid, he's slowed way down.
That's not true. He looked really great at the end of the season last year.
Hoyer is going to beat the socks off the Seahawks. Or the feathers!
How are you feeling about the NFC East?
Oh, the Cowboys are finally going to be able to pull through this year.
Are you sure? Once Jerry World was built, it seems to me they're too spoiled.
No way. I think they are going to take the East division this year.
Have you ever been to a game at Jerry's World? It's a madhouse there.
No, I've never had the pleasure. Someday I'd love to make the trip though.
I think Eli Manning will bring the Giants back to a division title.
Prescott will pull through for the Cowboys and beat those Giants into submission.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been getting ready for the new season?
What, the NFL season?
Ya man!
Of course I have! I just got a new TV the other day for watching with my friends.
Oh sweet man, are you gonna have football parties?
Oh ya definitely, and you're always invited man!
Sweet thanks man, who are you rooting for this year?
Normally I'd root for Patriots but this year I'm thinking the Falcons
Oh really, I've always thought of you as a Patriots fan for life.
They'll always have a special place in my heart but I just don;t think they can win this season.
Oh really what makes you think that?
Well for starts Tom Brady is starting to get pretty old.
Ya I guess you're right about that, he's definitely getting up there.
Ya, that's what I'm saying, you can only play well for so long.
What's making you go for the Falcons?
Well they had a pretty good season last year, and their games are always fun to watch
You're not wrong about that, I'll give you that.
Ya, especially on the new TV haha
Of course! I'm excited for some games.
Me too man, me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Detroit Lions next season?
I watched them a bit, but think they have a lot of issues.
Really?    What is the biggest problem you see?
Well, the rushing game was terrible last year.
True, but Theo Reddick seems to be healthy this season.
Yes, but both he and Ameer Abdullah need to be healthy.
What about the quarterback?
Matthew Stafford is good, but he does too much.
How can a good quarterback do too much?
A good offense should be balanced, and nearly 600 passes is just too much.
Isn't that a factor of the offensive line?
True, and unless Rick Wagner has a great season, that too is questionable.
Fine.      What about the kicking game then?
Well, it starts with Matt Prater.
That's what I'm talking about!
He is definitely a great kicker, although not necessarily the best in the league.
What about the punting?
I like Sam Martin.
Didn't he even get some team records last year.
Yes, he did a tremendous job in the first game in the Colts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Titans are stacking up on their receiving corp.
How's that?
They got Corey Davis AND Taywan Taylor.
Taywan was great at WKU. He amassed over 1730 yards his last year. Mariota should be able to target him pretty good.
They have just 3541 pass yardage with someone as accurate as Mariota.
He needs WRs and TEs. Which is why they're stacking up the receivers
Tenessee is actually not that bad from passing TD standpoint.
They're 8th in the league with 29 pass TDs
That's a respectable number
Yep. But Green Bay, man. 40 passing TDs. That's insane.
Aaron Rodgers is a passer. And he has Nelson and Adams who are both about the same in abilities
Randall Cobb was such a disappointment last year
Ugh. I played him in fantasy way too much. Regret it so much
He was expensive too.
I know. Never again.
We need to get preseason data for the rookies.
That's not gonna help much anyway.
Of course it will, it show cases the rookies
But they neve really show off what they can do.
Well, that's not the point, just seeing how they interact with the team says a lot about their potential.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any news on Big Ben Rothensberger?
Are you talking about the fourth of July accident.
Oh yes i did hear about that.
It was not true he did not blow up his fingers.
I find it hard to believe anyone would actually believe that story.
Some people did believe it.
The Steelers have won 6 super bowls correct
Yes they won four in the 70s and 80s durning the reign of the Steel curtain and 2 after that.
Who was your favorite player of all times
I would say Terry Bradshaw is one of my all time favorites.
He was pretty awsome durning his time.
He was playing durning the time of the Steel curtain.
As far as now i like Ben Rothinsberger
He is a great quarter back with a wonderful arm and he is fast for his size.
He is tall for a quarte back and he can take a hit better then most.
yes he can take a hit and he can run that ball if he needs to.
Wonder if we could make a game this year.
i would not mind seeing a preseason game. They are cheaper and less crowded.
That is a good idea.
Lets look into it today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think are the best NFL quarterbacks?
I think Tom Brady is very good.
He is but I feel he has a very good offense around him that helps him a lot.
That's true. I've also always been a big fan of Drew Brees.
I think he's a great player and a great guy.
I was glad to see that he plans to play another season.
Yeah I saw some questions arising about his contract extension.
He mentioned that he wants to win another championship. Basically confirming he'll continue to play.
That's good. He really is fun to watch.
I think Andrew Luck is great, too.
I always forget to consider him. He is very impressive.
You can't talk quarterbacks without talking about Matt Ryan, also.
His arm was so scary last year. He was throwing rockets.
Precision rockets at that.
Aaron Rodgers is really great too.
He's coming up on 300 touchdowns.
I saw that. He'll definitely hit it this coming season.
He'll be one of only 10 quarterbacks to do so.
Yeah, and he'll be the only one to have done it with less than 100 interceptions thrown.
Really? That's just shows how talented he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Patriots picked up Brandin Cooks?
From the Saints?
Yeah! They're offense looks ridiculous now.
The best get better.
For real. Cooks, Gronk, Edelman, and James White. Just to name a few.
What happened to Martellus Bennett?
They let him walk to the Packers, but they picked up the Indy tight end though.
Fleener or Allen?
Dwayne Allen, that's the guy.
Dang. He was pretty solid for the Colts too.
Not even to mention the fact that Tom Brady makes everyone play better.
No names to Hall of Famers. Brady can make a receiver great.
Think any one can stand up to them in the AFC?
Honestly, I'm thinking the Raiders.
Oooooo. That's a good pick.
Marshawn coming back to an already high-powered offense? Unreal.
Derek Carr just got paid, so he's looking to ball out.
Almost forgot about Khalil Mack on D for Oakland.
Dude's a beast.
That might be the game to watch this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you hear the Raiders are moving to Vegas?
Are you serious?
Completely, isn't that wild?
That is really interesting news.
It has to be the biggest story of the year so far.
I agree, when are they moving? This fall?
No, they said it will be a couple of years yet.
So what's the hold up you think?
They are building a new domed stadium for them and the UNLV team.
I see, so they will play there in 3 years. That gives us time to plan our vacation.
Right, I think a lot more people will want to travel to Vegas to see them than Oakland.
Yeah, I have no desire to go to Oakland at all but I will definitely go to Vegas to see a good game and gamble.
Yes, I think that will attract as many people as the football itself.
I wonder how the NFL will handle their athletes gambling while they're in Vegas to work?
That is what I've wondered about as well. It's legal, but doesn't seem like something an NFL player should be doing.
Well I see people like Gronk out there all the time partying though.
Yes but that's in the off season when they aren't working you know?
That is true, I never thought about it like that. And they will be the first pro sport franchise to be there, so there's no history.
It will be very interesting to see what the NFL rules about it.
Well I can't wait, I think the Raiders in Vegas is going to be pretty freaking awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you watch the NFL draft this year?
Of course, I never miss it.
What do you think about the 49ers picks?
I think the nailed it in the first few rounds. Solomon Thomas and Reuben Foster were excellent choices.
They need something. They have been terrible.
I know. Plus their quarterback situation is so different now.
Yeah, Kaepernick and Gabbert left and now all eyes are on Hoyer.
I hope he can do well for them, but there is still alot that is unknown.
You know, I am really hoping the Falcons can keep it together and make it back to the Super Bowl.
I am not really a Falcons fan, but it was a very disappointing loss for them this past year.
Matt Ryan deserves another shot at a ring.
I agree, I think he's been an excellent quarterback for many years, and deserves more recognition.
Yeah, but with Tom Brady still in the league, who knows.
Tom Brady has dominated for too long. I think someone else should get the spotlight.
Yes, he's won many rings. But if he's still healthy and successful, all power to him.
My eyes are on the Raiders. With Carr and Lynch, they are going to be interesting to watch.
There is definitely a lot of potential there.
I saw an interview with Carr after it was announced that he would get the largest contract in history, and he talked about tithing and living the same way. I thought that was really cool.
Wow, that is different. I hope he succeeds.
Me too. I think their team will go through alot of growth this year and in the years to come.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am in the mood for some good old fashioned football!
You will not have to wait much longer at this point.
It seems like it has been forever since the NFL has been on television!
Not really, every off season just feels that way for us true fans.
Speaking of the NFL, who do you think the best coach in the game is right now?
The question should be, who is the second best coach in the game right now?
What do you mean by that?
Well the best coach is obviously Bill Belichick.
That is what everyone says, but I see it differently.
Really? He has built a powerhouse in New England!
I know, but I think that might have a little something to do with Tom Brady!
Brady is great, but he has never won anything without Belichick.
Belichick has never won anything without Brady either!
I think we will just have to agree to disagree about this issue.
Do you want me to tell you who is really the best coach in the NFL at the moment?
I would be delighted to hear your opinion on the matter.
The answer is Pete Carroll. He is the best.
He is certainly a great coach, I can not argue that.
He has been great in college and in the pros's. Not even Belichick can say that!
Talk to me when Carroll wins a few more Superbowl's!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big fan of the NFL?
Yes, I watch a lot of games during the season.
Good. Who is your favorite team?
I am a big fan of the packers.
Oh, okay. I am a steelers fan.
Okay. They're pretty good too.
So how do you think your team will do this season?
I think we will be pretty good. Our division isn;t very strong.
Yeah, The bears, lions, and vikings all are okay, but not really top grade.
Yeah. What about you guys?
I think we will be okay. We are pretty solid at all positions.
Yeah, you guys are really deep at receiver.
Yeah we are. IT's going to be interesting to see what happens with bryant after his suspension.
Yeah, he looked like he worked hard with his time off though.
Very true, he looked like he was in really good shape. He also put on about ten pounds of muscle.
Yeah, but that high pick on a receiver put some pressure on.
Yeah, he will definitely be a starter i think. If he's decent him and bryant may fight for the two spot eventually.
Yeah. What about bell?
I heard they're still negotiating.
Thats interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the greatest NFL team of all time?
Easy, 1972 Miami Dolphins
Really, why do you say that?
Only undefeated team in NFL history
Did they win the Super Bowl?
Yes, they were undefeated.
Which Super Bowl was that?
Super Bowl VII
Who did they play?
Washington Redskins. Close game, 14-7
Wow, that was pretty close. Who was their coach
The legendary Don Shula
Did they have any other legendary players on the team?
Bob Griese is the big one.
Oh yeah, he was a QB right?
Right. Good one for his time too.
Yeah, I've seen him on TV as an analyst before.
Yes, that seems to be the traditional career path for former QBs.
He had a son that played too right?
Yes, Brian Griese.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the Saints signed Adrian Peterson this morning?
Dude yes!! Like holy cow, I would have never expected AP to be Saint.
It's insane. From the looks of it he seems like he is very healthy rite now.
Yeah I know and the Saints aquired him for cheap too.
How much was his contract for?
It's a 2 year $7 millon dollar deal.
Did the Saints give him a signing bonus too
Yup. AP is going to get a $2.5 millon signing bonus.
The Saints actually made a decent deal for once.
I literally was thinking the same thing when the news broke!
Seems like Mark Ingram is going to have stiff competiton this season.
I'm not entirely sure what role Adrian Peterson is going to have in the backfield, the Saints are already stacked.
Yeah I'm guessing Sean Payton is going to use AP in a smiliar role to like what Darren Sproles was.
Our offense is going to be unstoppable if that's the case.
Reminds me a lot of the 2009 Saints team.
Ah I wouldn't go that far, we still don't have a defense.
True but a very good offense like ours can pick up the slack left by defense.
I guess. But turnovers are always a huge problem for us.
Yeah I feel like we could have won way more games last season if it wasn't for turnovers.
My point exactly. You can't win games like if you're turning over the ball like we did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think Denver comes back this year?
Nope. No quarterback worth talking about...
What about Siemien? I thought he was good...
I have no confidence in him man, none at all
Come on man...don't be so negative
Can't help it, passing game was a piece a crap
WOW...coldblooded
They are wasting a good defense with this crap.
I think that Siemian was pretty decent though
It's OK for you think that...I don't
Who is his backup?
Lynch. Even worse...
Oh man, are you negative.
Shrug...if he was any good he'd be starting, right?
Right...
Ok, then.
I still think Denver will be good though
As good as their defense takes them
So wildcard spot, then?
Yep. One and done in the playoffs
XXXXXXXXXXX
So football season is coming up. Are you excited?
Absolutely!  Even after last year, when the Falcons chocked so badly
Oh yeah, that was one for the record books!
I doubt that will game will ever be forgotten
Do you think the Patriots are going to take it all again?
I think they'll make a good run, but no one is on top forever.
Good point, and no one is always a loser
And THAT'S why I'm still an Atlanta fan!
Haha!  Okay, but it's probably not their season this year either.
So who are you watching, other than the Pats?
The Steelers look very interesting this time around
Yeah?  Didn't their owner just die?
Yeah, but their defense this year is AMAZING
I'm looking at the Seahawks this year.  Their defense will also be very strong
Yeah, Seattle has really put effort into building
They're hungry for another bite of the apple after last year
Speaking about a comeback, Sports Illustrated has a lot of faith in Greenbay this time around.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, they've put a lot of work on their offense
Well, they have some ground to make up!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man, are you ready for some NFL?
I can hardly wait. When does training camp begin?
I'm not sure but soon. It's July, you know. Preseason'll start soon.
Who do you think's going to win the NFC South this year?
I like the Falcons again. What about you?
I can't decide, man. I want the Falcons to win, of course, but New Orleans is supposed to be much better this year.
Yeah, I heard that too. Drew Brees is tough.
He is, man. And he just seems to find a way to win if you give him the chance.
Yeah, I think last year was just an off year for the Saints.
I hope this year is too then. And I'm worried about Carolina.
What did they finish last year? Man, Super Bowl one year and wash outs the next.
Cam Newton is just so strong. He's like a pro playing with eighth graders sometimes.
I know. That arm is like a rocket. But he doesn't scramble like he used to.
I guess even Cam is taking some knocks that slow him down.
That's what they're complaining about, man. That the refs won't throw the flag on roughing.
I guess it isn't really fair. But Carolina definitely depends on him.
That's true. If Cam has a good year, Carolina will be tough to beat.
Like Brees and the Saints. When he's on and got a good team around him, I don't like to play him.
I hear you. But we'll see. What about Tampa Bay? They got anything?
Man, I haven't kept up with them at all but I think they drafted a pretty good QB maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know if Christian Ponder is still in the league?
Who that?
The dude from the Vikings.  Married a hot chick.  Took over from Worm-Killer McNabb.
Worm-Killer?
Used to bounce passes to the receivers.
Ok.  Well, never heard of him.  Don't know where he is and don't care.
You missed out; he was awful.
I really don't care.
Air balls all over the place.  Scared to take a hit. Just plain bad.
Maybe the line wasn't any good.
Don't you try to make excuses for him!  He stunk in high school, he stunk in college, and he stinks in the NFL.
What do you have against him?  Lots of QBs stink.
The NFL is a big boy league.  If you can take it like a man then you oughta quit.
Are we still talking football?  I'm sensing that you are drifting into some personal stuff.
I'm talking Ponder.  He's a stiff, a has-been, a never-was, a I'm-running-home-and cryin-to-mama kind of player.  Just like Jim Everett.
He made it to the NFL so he must have had some skills.
Blackmail was his skills.  He had something on something.
I just read that he's earned almost $11,000,000 in the NFL.
Not worth a penny!!!  He's a bum!
Keep in mind, that's $11,000,000 more than you earned in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! The NFL season starts in September!
I can't wait! Who are you following this year?
I'm  a lifelong Browns fan.
Aww man they never perform well! Why are you a fan of them?
I like to stay loyal to the home team.
Do they have any good players this year?
Yeah. They have a couple. What about Joe Thomas?
He goes to the Pro Bowl every year. He's gotta be good to make it there.
Who else do they have?
Well there's also Joe Haden.
How far do you expect them to go this year?
I'll admit they would be lucky to win five games.
Who do you think they may win against?
It depends which team shows up to play. Possibly the Bengals.
Oh yeah, the Bengals. Ohio really doesn't have much for a football team. Do they?
No we're not known for good NFL football. Who do you follow?
I tend to follow a couple teams. One is the Patriots.
Why because they won the Super Bowl?
Well, I do like my teams to win. They had to work to get there.
I like my teams to win also, but I don't like to jump ship just because they're struggling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you know when the NFL season starts?
I think it starts in less than 2 months.
I am so exicted. I can't wait.
Who is your team?
I like the Arizona Cardinals. How about you?
I am a Raiders fan. I think they will go far.
Yeah, that quarterback they have is pretty good.
And he is young too. THey were able to add some talent in the off season.
Yeah, the Cardinals were able to bring back a lot of their veterans.
Do you think they can get out of their division, though?
I think the Seahawks will be tough, as usual.
You are not worried about the Rams or niners?
No way. I think they are trying to figure stuff out.
Im worried about the Broncos, they are always our toughest competition.
Yeah, those Raiders Broncos games are always epic.
They can get pretty rough, too.
Yeah, but that's what football is all about.
True, hard play, hard hits.
I'm getting sick of all these calls protecting players. The game is getting soft.
Yeah, they should just let those guys play.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to any NFL games?
Only a few times and it was the Cowboys.
How is their stadium?
It is awesome.  Jerry Jones really put a lot of unique things inside.
I think the Falcons have a new stadium this year that looks really cool.
All these billionaire owners are trying to one up another with stadiums.
Don't forget the stadium in Los Angels for the Rams and Chargers.
Football in Los Angeles seems weird. Did you see any of those Rams games last year?
I did see some video of a few it was like no one was there.
There is too much to do in L.A.  I don't think the people are all in on football.
It's a shame that the Rams move from St. Louis.
It all came down to a stadium issue there.
It's hard for the small market teams in the NFL to compete financially.
Yes and the owners just want cities to pay for new stadiums because of the revenue the teams can generate for cities.
The NFL is big business for sure.  They get my money for merchandise and watching the games.
The Super Bowl is a must watch event now.
That last Super Bowl was one for the ages!
I agree, Tom Brady and the Patriots never quit.
These professionals really love the game and it showed through in the last Super Bowl when they could've given up.
Well Belichek alwasy has a plan and he made one for that comeback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what NFL team you rooting for this year?
Detroit Lions, I want to see them go to the Superbowl.
Their name came up in conversation because of some players that are being inducted into the Hall of Fame.
Oh yeah, who were they talking about?
The running back; Barry Sanders..
He's retired,  what did they have to say about him.
It was all good actually. Experts ranked him as the second greatest running back in NFL.
Wow, it's awesome to still be recognized for your talent after all these years.
Right. He retired back in 1999?
Yes in his early 30's.
He was smart, he got out while he was ahead.
You know it; football does take a toll on the player's body.
Yeah and we aren't feeling it, ha ha. We just feel the excitement while the endure the pain.
You got that riright. Who you looking at this year?
I'll be watching the Buc; they have potential.
They do, they also have some young players.
Yeah, they just drafted a 27 year old quarteback, named Sean Renfree.
Didn't he come from the Falcons?
I believe so.
Well I guess we will see how our teams do this season.  Good luck.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who is your favorite NFL coach?
Well, with no doubt it is Bill Cower.
Why is he your fav?
Watching him on the sidelines was great.
How so?
He yelled and scremed like a Northeasterner even when they were doing well.
Really?
He made me nostalgic for the Northeast.
Well, my favority was Rex Ryan.
Rex Ryan?
Yes, when he was fat.
Haha, why when he was fat?
He was more jolly then.
Jolly?
Yes, like he was having more fun.
That's funny.
He got way more serious when he lost all his weight.
Like Samson when he lost his hair?
Exactally! It was just a total 180.
Wow, i never thought of that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's an exciting player to watch?
I'd have to say Odell Beckham.
What team is he on?
He's a young receiver for the Giants.
Oh, I saw him before.
He's so explosive and entertaining.
His one handed catch was amazing.
He was falling out of bounds.
It's such a luxury to have him on your team.
He can easily catch a ball and go eighty yards for the touchdown.
I wonder how good the Giants will do this year.
They just signed Brandon Marshall.
He has a so so year with the Jets last season.
Their quarterback wasn't very good.
He should be good for the Giants.
He'll take some pressure of Beckham.
They have a lot of talent.
They also have Sterling Shepard.
Eli Manning should do well this year.
Yeah, even if he is pretty old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know American Football grew out of English sports such as rugby and soccer?
Yeah, it became popular on American college campuses in the late 1800s. The NFL was founded on August 20, 1920.
I did not know that.
Technically, it was the American Professional Football Association. 2 years later it changed its name to the National Football League, which would ultimately become the major league of American football.
You are just full of fun football facts, aren't you?
Yep.
Did you know the most watched television event in the United States is the Super Bowl?
That's not surprising. It's almost like a major holiday.
Did you know it takes about 600 cows to make one full season’s worth of NFL footballs?
Wow, that's a lot. I guess all that beef gets served during the game!
Seriously, Wilson Sporting Goods Company from Ada, Ohio, has been the official football supplier for the NFL since 1941.
That's a good gig to have.
Yeah, they make more than 2 million footballs of all sorts every year.
Crazy! They don't call it America's favorite past time for nothing!
Isn't that baseball?
No, football, especially the degree to which those NFL players play is so major.
Yeah, well think of the cow.
The cow?
A cow has only a 1 in 17,420,000 chance of becoming an NFL football that is used in the Super Bowl!
That is nuts, you would be better off playing the lottery. Though I don't think becoming a Superbowl ball would be a big win for that cow!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So the winningest QB for the superbowl is Brady?
Yes. He's gone to 7 and won 5.
Which ones did he lose?
He lost in consecutive apperances in 08 and 12. Both against Eli Manning and the giants.
That's gotta sting
A Giants and Patriots rematch in superbowl is a must. We have to see it
Who will win if that does happen?
Who knows, if it doesn't happen this year, we're talking Brady in his 40s.
Whoa. Brady is 40 already?
He's 39, but the superbowl will be next year, so he will be 40, but if it doesn't happen this season, we're talking about brady being 41 and older
I wonder who the oldest QB ever to win the superbowl.
Easy. Peyton Manning. The 50th superbowl last year. He was 39
Who's the second oldest?
Elway, he held thast record until Mannning took it away. Elway was 38.
That's funny Elway owns the Broncos.
Yeah, but it's a good your team won tough, so losing a record isn't really a big deal.
Yeah, Guess so. So, wait if Brady is 39 now, and then he was 38 uring the last superbowl?
Yep. He doesn't have too many years left.
I wish he'd go this year and at least tie Manning's record
That would be a sight to see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Cam Newton?
I love him. He's a great player
He is, and he's also a pretty snappy dresser.
Yes. He does have that going for him as well.
Do you think the Panthers will have a good season?
I don't know. They're all over the map lately.
I think Drew Brees and the Saints might be okay this year.
I think Drew is a little old.
True. The bears need to get their QB situation straight too
For sure. I think Mike Glennon will be good though
They only went 3-13 last year so anything is better
absolutely. I don't like John Fox.
He used to coach the Panthers correct?
Yes. He was bad with them too.
Who coaches them now
Ron Rivera is the coach.
Ah. Riverboat Ron.
He's a great coach I think
I agree hopefully he takes the panthers somewhere this year.
Anything is better than 6-10
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm ready for the football season to begin - the Pats are going to take it again!
I don't think so. It's way to early to predict a Super Bowl winner.
So if you don't like the Patriots, who do you like?
I've always been partial to the Tennessee Titans.
Are you kidding me!  They don't have any defense. I don't think they could even beat the Browns!
Hey, the Browns aren't so bad. And their fans love them!
Yeah, but have you even been to Cleveland? The Browns are about the only thing there to love!
Maybe, but when it comes to a football town, Dallas is the winner
I have to admit you're right. The Cowboys also have rabid fans, even when they have a bad season.
That's the Landry and Staubach legacy at work!
Landry was hands-down one of the best NFL coaches ever. He could take on any of today's teams!
He sure knew talent when he saw it. The Cowboys were THE team to watch back then.
Today, it's definitely the Patriots who are in the spotlight all the time.
Yeah, kind of reminds me of the Joe Montana days with the 49ers. He could do no wrong.
Or John Elway with the Broncos.
And today we're stuck with guys like Colin Kaepernick and Tom Brady.
Nothing wrong with Brady, my friend! But Kaepernick - I'll give you that one.
I just wish he'd stick to football and stay out of political issues.
Joe Montana must be rolling his eyes!
Well, at least Kaepernick's a free agent now. Interesting to see if anyone picks him up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the superbowl this year?
I would say probably the Patriots
Oh god are you serious
How can they not, Tom Brady is back and the team is the same pretty much from last year
I know but at some point they have to start losing
I doubt it they have a hell of a team and a great coach
A Cheating coach you mean
even with the cheating he is still great
True, they still find a way to win
Who do you think is going to win?
More than likely in my opinion the Steelers
Ewww.  Big Ben and company?
Yeah they always have that resiliance that a lot of teams are missing
yup you cannot deny that they have great drive
I mean you can knock that team down and beat the crap out of them and they keep on coming
I remember when they had Jerome Betis that guy was a beast
you talking about "The Bus"
Yeah that guy would plow right through the defense
I know Bill Bellicheck loved that guy
yup
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Chargers and Raiders both moving to new cities?
I feel sorry for the fans. The Raider fans have been through it before but the Charger fans must be crushed.
Yeah, I hope they have lousy seasons. That's just wrong.
I agree. And since I'm a Denver Bronco fan, I really hope they're lousy!
Did you see the Chargers' new logo?
Yes, I did. What a slam to San Diego. All the years they were there, they never added SD to the logo.
I wonder what the Raiders are going to do?
I haven't heard but I'll let you know if I see something. What do you think about John Lynch going to San Francisco?
I think it's great! I always liked John Lynch.
Me, too! I'm going to be rooting for them to do well. He's good friends with John Elway and he's been giving him tips
I'm just glad they got rid of Kaepernick.
Yes, I didn't care for him.
What do you think about Denver signing Jamaal Charles?
Oh, I thought it was fantastic. I like him and he's been a big Bronco fan his whole life.
You're kidding, really?
Yes, I even saw a picture of him as a teen wearing a John Elway jersey. It was funny.
Ha ha, I can just see the KC fans when they saw that.
Some of them were really mad. They had no idea.
Maybe he'll do good there.
I hope so. We need a good running back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw highlights from Superbowl VI last night.
Dallas versus Miami, 1972.
Yes, the first time Dallas won a Superbowl.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Roger Staubach for the Cowboys, Bob Griese for the Dolphins.
Where was it played?
Tulane Stadium.
Wasn't it cold?
39 degrees at kickoff.
Who scored first?
Dallas, on a field goal in the first quarter.
What was the halftime score?
10-3 Dallas.
Wasn't it a jazzy halftime show?
Ella Fitzgerald and Al Hirt.
What happened in the third quarter?
Dallas scored a touchdown, Miami, nothing.
What was the final score?
24-3.
Sounds like not much of a game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best player in the NFL?
Tom Brady, definitely.
I take it you're a New England Patriots fan then?
Not really. I'm just stating facts.
What makes Tom Brady so good in your opinion?
It's a fact. Who was the MVP at the last Superbowl?
Well it is true that Tom Brady won the the MVP in this year's Superbowl.
Not just this year. This was the fourth time he's won it.
Other players have won it multiple times though, not just him.
He's won Superbowl MVP more than any other player - four times. Joe Montana won it three times back in the 1980's
I personally think he's overrated.
I personally think you're being a snob. He has earned his accolades.
Don't you think it's time for him to retire?
To be honest I thought he would retire after he won MVP in Superbowl 2015. Yet he stayed playing, and came back to win MVP again in Superbowl 2017.
He's almost 40 years old now though. I think his career is coming to an end.
Yes, well it had to someday didn't it. He looks like he may still have some power left in him for another year or two though.
If he doesn't get injured first, maybe.
Yes at his age his body can't handle any serious injuries.
I couldn't handle that kind of injury at my age and I'm 22!
Thank goodness for all that padding and body protection they wear!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Von MIller will be the sack leader?
No Ricky-Jean will be.
Did you see that a few NFL players invested into a 12 y/o business.
Yes, but that news never gets broadcasted.
I'm just happy Trey Griffey is off the IRL.
Me too- he's going to have a huge impact this season.
Whose your next big  star wide receiver?
Courtland Sutton....easy
Do you think guaranteed contracts for NFL players are right?
Yes, with the risk of injury being the highest.
Hardest position in the NFL?
CB by far with the way these receivers are.
Whos going to win the superbowl?
I hate them, but New England.
Who's the best kicker right now?
Brad Wing.
How any games do you think the Saints win?
8
Does Drew Breese break the record?
Nope
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you going to be home Sunday for the game?
Which one, the 12:00 or 3:00?
The Cowboys vs Eagles game at 3.
Oh yeah, I have to run errands in the morning. But, I'll be there for that for sure.
Man Cowboys gonna whoop up on some Eagles.
You know that. Man Prescott is going show them what Texas ball is.
Yeah and Eagles defense is Whack!
I don't know. They grabbed up some defense during the draft.
We'll see. But, Dallas is got that offense, yo!
Yeah they do. Man Elliott is a beast.
The Eagles got a good rookie quarterback though.
Yeah but do they have anything else on offense?
I guess we'll find out tomorrow.
Yeah we will. Dallas got that crazy offense.
Yeah man, defense isn't too bad either.
No, but hopefully some of that they picked up in the draft will strengthen it.
Heck yeah.
Man, this going to be a pretty good game.
Yeah, sure enough. You watching on the big screen?
You know it. I got that mancave set up for NFL,yo!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright, who's your pick for Superbowl this year.
Ha, ha we haven't even started pre-season yet.
Yeah, well still.  You must have some idea about who will be the best.
It will probably be New England again.
You think?  I don't know.  They are starting to get old.
Are you kidding.  That don't seem to affect that team. They just find a way to win.
That's the truth.  Well I think it will be Denver for the AFC and Dallas for the NFC with the Cowboys winning.
In your dreams. Denver might get there but the Cowboys?
Hey, they were supposed to be there last year but had a couple bad snags.
Yeah, like loosing their QB.
Well, we found a diamond in the ruff though and this year he will be even better.
Well, we'll see.  I think that Carolina and Arizona will be tough to beat this year.
Can't count Green bay out either.  Ever.
That's true.  Rogers is still at the helm so anything can happen there.
Yeah, it's getting about time for him to retire too ain't it?
Yeah, he is probably getting close.  I think over the next couple of years there will be several greats that will retire.
I know.  It's hard to believe that some of these guys have been in now for 12, 15 years now.
Yeah, like Rothlessburger and what's his name down in New Orleans.
Drew Breeze.
Yeah. Him too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL is getting closer and closer!
I know, I wish it would just get here already!
What is your favorite story-line heading into the season?
I am looking forward to seeing if the Oakland Raiders can continue to improve.
Yea, it seems like they have been bad for a very long time.
Now they have some nice young talent and the franchise is finally starting to look good.
Don't they have a pretty good receiver?
Yes, they have Amari Cooper and he has been very good for them.
He and Derek Carr seem to have something going with one another.
Yea they have excellent chemistry on the field together.
Do you think they will make the playoffs this year?
I really feel that they will get there this time around.
Any other story lines that have your attention?
I am very interested in Cam Newton Actually.
What about him exactly?
I just want to see if he can return to form and play like we are used to him playing.
He did not have a good year at all last year.
No, he just seemed off last year. So I think this is a big year for him.
Do you feel that he is an elite NFL quarterback?
I really do, but he has to prove it on the field.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everyone asks about favorite teams, but what I want to know is what is your most despised NFL team?
Personally, I really can't stand the New England Patriots.
I feel like that's a common response to that question.  Why don't you like them.
I don't like them because of their known history of cheating.
I think they were cleared the last time something like that happened.
I don't think they were cleared.  Usually when someone receives a punishment it's because they did something wrong.
Good point.  I'm not much of a Tom Brady fan myself.
He's another reason I don't like the Patriots.
A lot of people like him, but something about him just makes me very suspicious of him.
Agreed.  I do think Bill Belichick is one of the best coaches in the game right now though.
Even though there's been accusations of play stealing?
Even with that I think he's one of the best coaches.
What do you think of Sean Payton?
Anyone that offers a reward for injuries in a game like this should be banned from the game.
There have been a few incidents of obvious intent to injure in the last few seasons.
But there's a difference between losing control of emotion on the play field and offering players compensation for causing injuries.
I suppose you're right.
Ever since that incident I've completely hated Sean Payton.
Do you feel the same way about Drew Brees?
No, I think he's a decent enough person and definitely a good enough player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the youngest NFL player that you know of?
it's got to be Ezekiel Elliott if I am current on my players.
How old is he?
He's only 21.
That is pretty young.
Yeah he was the butt of a lot of jokes in the media.
Really? How so?
It wasn't anything bad, just poking fun at the guy about his age and being on the Cowboys.
What would people say?
I can't really all of them to be honest but the best one I'd say was a lion king reference.
The lion king?
Yeah, they joked about him being like simba except he took over as king as soon as he was born.
Doesn't sound very funny to me.
I'm bad at retelling jokes to be honest.
I would agree with you.
Why did you want to know who the youngest player was anyway?
Well I thought Amari Cooper was the youngest so I figured I'd ask you to confirm.
How old is cooper?
22 years old.
He's one year early.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Since the NFL season was coming up, I randomly had a question come to mind.
What is it?
Do you think Terrell Owens was snubbed of the Hall of Fame?
Honestly yes. His stats match up with the greats.
Isn't he top three in Touchdown receptions?
Number 2 or 3. I think Moss is 3, while he was number 2.
How can you not put that in the hall?
Not only that, but he had over 1000 catches and 15000 receiving yards.
The man was a freak of nature.
He proved that during the Eagles Superbowl run.
Didn't he break his ankle late in the season and still was amazing in the Superbowl.
I don't even get how he did it. His documentary showed he was hobbling mightily like a week before that game.
And people want to say he has no heart and is only about himself.
You can't be selfish if you are running on an ankle that is basically on the brink of breaking at any second and still trying your hardest.
That game would have been a Pats blowout for sure.
It's a shame him and McNabb Loathed each other.
Seems like every team, but the Cowboys hated him. For the most part
He had a big mouth. The man talked too much, but my goodness he backed up that talk.
Back on the overall topic even Polian said he shouldn't be in, because he was a team killer. Like come on man attitude isn't a tangible thing.
The hall is about what did on the field not off of it. Even if he did spike a ball right on the Dallas Cowboys' star.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are the Browns ever gonna be good?
I hope so. I bet my friend they would.
How much did you bet?
About 20 bucks
Okay, not too bad
They need to get their team together
I don't know if they can
They can. I don't care if they have been last place forever
You need to cheer for a new team
I am not going to. I am from Cleveland
I'm from Baltimore and I am a Vikings fan
Hey, I like the Vikings too
Really?
Yes. I love their purple colors
Yeah, they are very unique
They might win it one year
They have a good squad.
Not as good as the Patriots
You know, I do not think they will repeat.
Me neither
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah sure.  You?
Yeah I love it.
That's cool.  I think I like college a bit more than the nfl.
Why is that?
I don't know, I guess it seems to mean more.
Like what school spirit or something?
I guess.
I can sort of see that.
Why do you like the NFL?
I like how good the players are.
That all?
I also like how, for the most part, teams compete with each other equally.
I can see that.
Yeah, sometimes in college you don't get that.
That's true.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is going on here?
Well, it seems that the Rams are getting their asses kicked by the Broncos!
Well, darn it! I thought they were gonna do better than that!
Not with Peyton Manning as their Quarterback.
Who's your favorite team to win this year's season?
Maybe the Colts?
Nahhh, they don't got anyone.
The Buccaneers might have a chance!
Do they now?
I don't see why not!
I agree, they used to be really bad, until their most recent QB came in!
Who else are we talking about?
Not sure, don't have anyone in mind.
What about the Dolphins?
The Dolphins are okay.
Yeah, that's right!
But they don't stand a chance against the Packers.
No, they don't.
What about the Jaguars?
Not so sure about them, not after Jessica Namath slayed them in her fox fur jacket!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the jaguars improve this year.
Yes I do.
I do too.
I think to coughlin will help the team.
He's a smart man.
Yes,and he's tough.
He's a disciplinarian.
They have some good talent.
I know they do.
They added Leonard fournette and Dede Westbrook.
Very good additions.
Fournette will help Blake bortles.
Yes he will.
A.J. Boule and Jalen Ramsey are great corners.
Yes they are.
Cam Robinson adds power in the run game.
I forgot about him.
Run blocking should be better.
I think they have a shot it .500
I have to agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the incoming rookie quarterbacks do you think will have the best season in 2017?
I would say Patrick Mahomes, but I'm not too optimistic about him.
This is not a great rookie quarterback class. I'm still surprised you chose Mahomes though.
I don't necessarily believe that he has the highest ceiling of this rookie class, but I think that having Andy Reid has his head coach positions him well for success.
I like Andy Reid a lot, but Mahomes never ran a pro-style offense at Texas Tech. Why do you think he'll be able to pick it up quickly in the NFL?
The good thing for Mahomes is that he doesn't need to pick it up too quickly because the Chiefs have a reliable veteran in Alex Smith.
Fair point, we'll see who's right once we're in the season.
Yeah, who do you have as your top rookie quarterback going into the season.
I know that this is unusual, but I think that DeShone Kizer has the most potential of anyone from this rookie class.
Are you serious? The rookie quarterback for the dumpster fire that is the Cleveland Browns?
Hear me out. He has size, arm strength, and an offensive-minded head coach in Hue Jackson.
Yeah, but he plays for the worst football team in the NFL in a very tough division.
I totally agree that Cleveland isn't a model franchise, but Kizer will be stepping into an offense with a decent running game and a good offensive line. Give him a chance.
I don't think Cleveland has held on to the same quarterback for more than two seasons since they got their NFL franchise back in 1999. I wouldn't hold my breath.
It's only Hue Jackson's second year. Again, please give him a chance.
Their 1-15 record from last year is more than enough evidence for me to make up my mind about Hue Jackson as a head coach. In fact, I would say that DeShone Kizer is in a worse situation football-wise compared with Mitch Trubisky.
I agree that Mitch Trubisky is a pretty bad situation in Chicago, but at least he has a veteran quarterback in Mike Glennon that he can develop behind.
The Chicago Bears are an organizational mess that over traded to move up to second in the Draft to take Trubisky. I am worried for him.
I wish I could disagree with you more, but with the loss of Alshon Jeffery in free agency, I don't see him having any offensive weapons.
Yeah, and the issues are only compounded by their defensive-minded head coach John Fox.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the season?
You mean the NFL season?
Yeah, do you have a team?
Actually I'm from St. Louis
Oh, that SUCKS man.
I know. I'm trying to figure it out.
Why don't you become a Chiefs fan?
I'm not gonna go over there just because it's Missouri
Just a suggestion.
Yeah, I was a Packers fan growing up.
You mean before the Rams came?
Yeah.
So are you gonna go back to the pack?
Eh. I think so. They are pretty good though.
Isn't that a good thing?
Not really. I want to buy low.
Buy low?
Yeah I don't want to look like a bandwagoner.
Well that's tough man.
I'll figure it out before the start of the season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XI.
Which one was that?
Oakland Raiders over the Minnesota Vikings.
The Vikings?  I heard they never won.
This was their fourth appearance.
Who quarterbacked?
Fran Tarkenton for the Vikings and Kenny Stabler for the Raiders.
Who scored first?
No score in the first quarter, but the Raiders scored 16 in the second.
What was the score at halftime?
16-0, Raiders.
Who was in the halftime show?
The New Mickey Mouse Club.
That was lame.
Oakland scored a field goal in third, while Minnesota scored a touchdown.
So it was 19-7?
Yes.  The Raiders scored two touchdowns to make it 32-7.
Not 33?
There was a missed PAT.  Minnesota scored again but it was too late.
The Vikings had not luck in the Superbowl.

I was so surprised about this info on NFL players.
What are you talking about?
t’s become almost an expected norm that close to 78% of NFL players become bankrupt barely 2 years after ending their careers.
You would think they would have financial advisors to help them be a little smarter with their earnings.
This is an interesting fact that when I first heard it I couldn't wrap my brain around it at first.
What are you talking about?
The Arizona Cardinals are older than the state of Arizona.
Huh? How is that possible?
Exactly totally confusing until you know the Cardinals were founded in 1898, while Arizona was granted statehood in 1912.
Okay that makes sense now.
This one will crack you up! Brett Favre's first completed pass was to Brett Favre.
Say what?! How is that possible?
The longtime Green Bay Packers quarterback completed his first pass to himself for a loss of seven yards. (Favre's first attempted pass was a touchdown ... for the other team.)
That is funny ! It's a wonder they didn't fire him.
You know there are some crazy things about helmets that I didn't know about.
oh wait I know one the Philadelphia Eagles are the only NFL team with a logo that faces left.
That is a good one. But I found this fact(not about helmets) to be confusing.
What is it about? Or what team?
Since 1971, the Dallas Cowboys haven’t had a game in Dallas. In fact, their stadium isn’t even in that city. It’s in Arlington, Texas!
That's just weird to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, only a few more weeks and football season is here. Are you excited?
Yes! What team do you think will win it all this year?
I'm rooting for the Texans this year.
Yeah they have a superstar young quarterback Deshaun Watson
Yes, they also have an amazing defense.
This year, hopefully JJ Watt stays healthy.
Do you think they can beat New England?
I think the Texans have a better team.  Hopefully, the coaching is good.
Yes, there have been issues with O'Brien but he is a great guy.
O'Brien needs to be more aggressive this year.
I also love the Panthers.  What about you?
The Panthers are good.  Cam Newton didn't have a great year last year though.
I know, but this year should be better if he's healthy.
Everyone was after him last year.  He kept getting sacked.
Yes, the offensive line needs to do a better job.
I agree with that.
However, between the two, I want the Texans to win the superbowl.
I'm with you, the Texans deserve a chance to win.
Yes, they've given up a lot for Watson.
We will see as the season starts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Love it!
Oh? What's your favorite team?
The Bills
The Bills!?!?
Yea man.  My hometown.
Well I can see liking them as a kid.  But after you get older how can you like them?
I dont know.  I guess I just never stopped cheering for them
I see.  But they haven't been to the playoffs since like... the 90's!
Very true.  But I'm hopeful!
That's all you can be with a team like that!
Well our roster is looking pretty mean this year
The thing is, it has several other times in the past as well
True.  But this year it will be different
People keep saying that every year!
Yea but you gotta keep the faith alive!
I gotta run
Yea, we'll talk later
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this season?
I like the Cowboy's
Really? I think Dak and Zeke will have the Sophmore slump
Nah. Cowboys have a great Offensive Line and the sophmore slump is a myth.
I like the Patriots
Yeah, can't bet against Belicheck and Brady
Brady really is timeless, it is amazing
I think they will win the AFC for sure.
Who is your dark horse pick?
I'm thinking the Jags.
What? you're crazy, why?
I like the rookie Fournette, and I think Bortles takes a big leap forward
Come one. Bortles has shown he is mediocre at best. I do like Fournette he was a beast at LSU
Yeah, who is your dark horse?
I like Cam and the Panthers to bounce back
Hm. Seems like a solid pick.
Yeah, I think last season was just a one off
I worry about Cam getting injured
Me too, but he is versatle
Yup, he can beat you with his arm or his feet
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Yeah, I like the NFL.
Have you ever been to a game?
No.
Me either.
I have been to a couple stadiums.
Which ones?
I've been to the one in Nashville and Atlanta. I also saw the one from the road in Cincinnati.
The stadiums are so expesive.
They are.
I read about the one in Seattle, which was $200 million.
Most of the time they are empty.
Yeah, it's hard to see how they turn a profit.
I guess the ticket prices add up since they hold so many people.
Yeah, but if you have a bad team, you might not sell so many tickets.
Right, or you might have too small of a town.
It's interesting that in New York the two teams use the same stadium.
Yeah, but it's a big one.
Right, they sell plenty of tickets.
There are plenty of sports teams there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you going to go to Latrobe to watch training camp?
I am, and I am excited.
What is going good for the Steelers this year?
Well, Martavis Bryant is back for one thing.
Man, that's great, I'm glad he got reinstated.
Yeah, some of the rules in the NFL are pretty arbitrary and outdated.
Seems like they would work more with the guys that have problems instead of ostracizing them.
I agree, but that's over for him. He is back in the black and gold and I think he is going to have a breakout year.
That would be fantastic. Who else is back?
Cam Heyward for one, he's recovered from that chest tear and will be back to take over leadership on defense.
I heard one of the Steelers say this week that your best ability is availability. So true isn't it?
I could not agree more. Staying healthy is completely the name of the game.
Do you think Ben will stay healthy this year?
Oh my goodness, I certainly hope so. I'm planning on watching him take this team to the super bowl.
So you are telling me there is a chance.
Definitely.  Martavis Bryant, Antonio Brown, Leveon Bell, Ben, all of those guys are top of the heap competitors.
Really just one team to beat then.
Don't even mention their name.
O.K. I definitely will not say the name of the team that has Tom Brady as its quarterback and that is the team the Steelers must be able to beat.
Good.  I don't want to hear it.  And anyways, this is the year that the Steelers D learns how to shut them down. Hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey
Lets talk about football
Sounds great
Its one of my favorite sports
Mine too
My favorite team is the Vinings
They are a good team
Who do you like
I like the dallas cowboys
They are okay
People either love them or hate them
Exactly
I love them though
They arent a bad team
Just not your favorite?
Exactly
I understand
Its a sports thing
Pretty much
XXXXXXXXXXX
So give me your favorite NFL memory.
Well, I'd say The Catch.  When Frisco scored on the Cowboys in the NFC Title.
Oh, yeah.  Montana to Clark.  Great one.
How bout you.  What's your favorite NFL memory?
Hmm.  The Fogbowl at Soldier Stadium with the Bears against the Eagles.
Yeah, that was a weird game.  You could hardly see the game as it was being played.
Then there was the Icebowl.
Was that the Thanksgiving game between Dallas and the Eagles?
No, it was Green bay against Dallas to see who was going to go to the first Superbowl
That's right and GB went on to beat the Colts.
Yeah, Baltimore Colts back then.
Did you see that one I was talking about on Thanksgiving where there was ice on the field at Dallas.
Yeah, against the Dolphins.  I think they call that the snowbowl. It was snow on the field.
Right and Leon Lett did the "Lett factor" again and Dallas lost the game.
I also loved the Superbowl moment when John Elway flung himself sideways over the endzone line for a TD.
He had a pretty good run those last two seasons to end his carrier that's for sure.
He sure did.  I wish that Manning had gone out that way.
Yeah, he was kind of like Montana in that he should have retired a year earlier.
Never want to see the legends decline.
Nope.  Rather see them go out on top like Elway did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Chicago bears?
Not since Singletary, Tomzack and Perry were on the team.
When was that?
Probably mid 80's I think.
That was a while ago. How old were you?
I think somewhere around 12 or 13 I think.
Why is that time so special?
My dad lived outside of Chicago and he would take me to go see the games sometimes.
That would be a good reason to like them if you see them play in person.
Yes but it was more than that.
What do you mean?
Well in truth I loved watching the three of them play.
Tomzack was an amazing quarterback but certainly not the best.
Maybe not but he was fun to watch play.
What position did Singletary play?
He was a linebacker and is now a coach.
Who was Perry?
William Perry was a defensive lineman.
Wait I remember him. He had a cool nickname right?
They called him Refrigerator Perry and he was a force to be reckoned with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite part of an NFL gameday experience?
Oh that's a tough one, I love a bunch of things.
For me, it's the tailgating and the food.
Okay, that's definitely my favorite thing too.
There's just so many foods and drinks that I enjoy before I go into the game.
Yes, but I try to take it easy so I can still enjoy the ballgame.
One time, I ate so much at the stadium that I spent the whole game with a stomach ache.
Oh no, that would be no fun at all.
It wasn't fun, and it was an overtime game, so it lasted even longer and I couldn't go home.
I have to say that my second favorite thing about going to an NFL game is the crowd.
You really enjoy all those people?
Oh yeah. Why wouldn't I love being in a big crowd?
It takes a long time to park, drive, and get to your seat.
Yes, but it feels great to be a part of 70,000 people cheering or booing.
I guess it is cool and unique to be among a crowd with that sheer size.
You're not going to experience that feeling in a lot of other places, so you might as well enjoy it.
I went to a New York Jets game last year, and the crowd was rowdy and rude.
That can happen at certain NFL stadiums, but for the most part the people are really nice.
I guess when I go to a game this year I will have to learn to appreciate the people around me more.
Try it, because it creates a great sense of community and togetherness while cheering for your team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are your thoughts about LA this year?
Oh man. I don't know
I know people are in love with Goff but I think its too soon
I totally agree
He is good but so raw
Did you see him last year play? Ugh.
I never understood the learn on the job idea.
Exactly. Whether it be football or day to day live, it rarely goes well.
In football it will get you killed and injured
Valid point
I guess LA is under such pressure to win now
At least the defense is good though.
For sure! They are lights out when they are on.
I just worry about the lack of depth
Well they are a young team. Maybe in the future it will be better?
I would hope so
For the fans sake
Ugh, no kidding. There were some real stinkers last year
Its never good when the coach gets fired either
True enough
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about them Cowboys?
The expectations are going to be high this year.
They have a good young core of players and teams will be ready for them this year.
Dak played solid last year, but it will be interesting to see this new season.
It just seems like the Cowboys have a problem getting over the hump.
They really looked good last year.
Dak and Zeke are a good combo.  If they can run the ball and chip away at teams like last year, they should be okay.
The other nfl teams now have the tapes.  They are going to study up on Dak.  They are going to make it harder on him.
For him to step in last year and lead them was huge.  Not having Tony Romo looking over his shoulder could be good and bad.
People loved Romo, but for whatever reason, he couldn't show up when it counted.  I just hope Dak can get them over the hump.
Dak plays smart.  He is not throwing a bunch of interceptions.
Being safe with the ball got them lots of wins last year.  They just can't get behind.
Dak being the man now in Dallas means carrying all the weight.
He is a talent.  Dallas had to move on. He just has to win.  If he starts losing, the people will turn quick in Dallas and start talking about Romo.
Running the ball and controlling the clock is going to be their way forward.
It is hard to mess it up with Zeke running the ball.  Just hand it off and let him go to work.
I just think Dak is going to focus on hitting those open tight ends and wideouts to keep the chains moving.
They don't have to be complex.  Just keep it simple.  Chew the clock and put up points in the red zone.
The schedule for Dallas is going to be harder this year.  Dak and Zeke are going to have to rise to the occasion.
The Cowboys have a talented young group of players that should be good for years to come.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what is this - football?
Yeah, wanna watch it with me
um..no thanks.  i can never understand it.
Huh?  its so easy ::Screams::
see?  you just screamed and nothing happened at all
A lot happened!  did you see that!  wow!
No, i didnt see anything.  One guy ran, the clock stopped and now everyone is screaming
well, you just dont appreciate it. ha!
well, you know that football in other countries is soccer, right?
yeah but were not in other countries.  we are here
Well, isnt it backward we are the only country that watches this?  300 pound men slamming into each other?
its more than that and you know it.  let people be.  You still enjoyed the superbowl party last year
well yeah, to drink and eat and the commercials.
and you said Tom Brady was cute
well, he is.  Is he playing?  Maybe I will watch football, ha.  Hes the quarterback right?
yeah - see you know more than you think you do
didn't get get in trouble for deflating balls?
Lets not go into that...
OOO....Tom Brady.  scoot over, I wanna watch now, ha!
told you you'd like football eventually
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you got your Seahawks going to the big game again this year?
Man, after what happened in 2015, I was pretty let down.
They've had a good run lately though! I think Russell Wilson's still got it in him.
Yeah. I also feel a bit bad about CTE and the brain injuries.
What do you mean?
I mean, the evidence strongly suggests that playing football in the modern way leads to chronic and irreparable brain damage. Is that ethical to watch?
I mean, I don't hear many of the players complaining about the risks. They make good money.
I don't know if you can pay someone enough money to make it acceptable to give them a brain injury. It makes it more of a blood sport than I want to watch.
I'd trade jobs with any of the players in a heartbeat, brain injury or no brain injury.
Well, they're adults. They can do what they want.
But it still bothers you?
I guess I just don't want to contribute by watching, you know?
Well, you're going to be missing out on some good stuff if you skip SuperBowl LI.
Superbowl LI? I thought they'd given up on roman numerals.
Nah, I bet they just thought L looked strange all by itself. They'll probably go back.
Whatever. Guess we'll find out.
Hey, if it bothers you we don't have to talk about it.
Thanks, I appreciate you saying that.
I take it you're out for fantasy this year too?
Yeah man, I think that's for the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, Marshawn Lynch is a Raider now. Isn't that something?
Yea, they have a team and they all seem like tough guys.
Yea, well that fits the city of Oakland, doesn't it?
It sure does and they do have a great team.
Yea, in any city, they would be good. They have some playmakers.
Yea, well they have Carr throwing to Cooper.
Yea, that already is a great start.
Yup! Add Lynch to the mix and you really have something.
Yea, well their defense isn't too bad either.
Yea, hopefully they will improve this year, but they have been okay.
I agree! They need that to go along with good quarterback play.
Yea, well with the contract that they gave Carr, they let him know that he is the leader.
Yea, I agree. Its time for them to take the next step.
I truly think that they will this year and veterans like Marshawn Lynch should help a lot.
Yea, he should. He can really run the ball.
I agree and that is something that they didn't have much of last year.
They didn't but they do now and it could be something special.
Yea, definitely. We will just have to find out as the season goes on.
Yea, it should be an interesting year.
Yea, both the AFC and NFC stack up nicely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which league is better, the NFL or the NBA?
It is the NFL without a doubt in my opinion.
I agree with you about that. Television ratings feel the same way!
Yea the NFL always draws great TV numbers.
Have you been able to check out any Chicago Bears games lately?
I watch them on TV every Sunday, but I have not been able to attend a game live in a few years.
Me and my dad went to a few games last year for the first time in a while.
Did you guys have a pretty good time?
We had about as much fun as possible watching the Bears play!
I sure know what you mean about that!
I just wish we could get back to the playoffs at the very least.
Do you think John Fox will do a good job?
I do not know, I am just hoping at this point.
Well, he did take the Carolina Panthers to the Superbowl before.
I know; I am going to be patient and hope for the best.
At least we finally got rid of Jay Cutler!
I know but I am not sure if that will help us in the long run or not.
What do you think about our draft pick?
I could not believe that Mitch Trubisky was the pick!
Who knows, maybe he will be the franchise quarterback we have been missing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
None of those teams have any chance of going to the Superbowl anytime soon.
Dallas maybe.
It's a big maybe.
i think it's more important to look at the point allowed compared to points made.
I mean obviously. The Saint no 2 in terms of points scored per game with 29.3 points/game, but they give up 28.4 points/game
And look at Partiots. They give up 15.6 points/game while scoring 27.6 points/game
I wonder how did Falcons do last year
They gave up 25.4 points/game, but got 33.8 points/game
which explains why they were able to lead the Pats in the superbowl by 25 points initially.
yep. It's an offense powerhouse, but defense wise, they need work.
Obvioiusly. otherwise, Brady woldn't have been able to mke the biggest comeback in history
We should watch that game again. It's on youtube.
The full game?
Yep.
Huh. Guess the NFL learned a valuable lesson of allowing full games tobe viewed on youtube.
Revenue from youtube is better than no revenue from youtube. It IS a valuable lesson.
You know this points against vs points for is meaningless.
Well, it's at least something to go on.
But look at the total, Pats are no 2, and Falcons are no 1, with Cowboys not far behind. I think win percent is a better marker
Not really, because divisions have different strength of schedule. Win percent depends on that also. Pats have the highest win percent and Cowboys are the second. Anythgin can happen in the post season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it football season yet?
No you got a few more months.
I cant wait I got a new fifth wheel.
Why?
I am going to every AFC East game I can?
Is your wife ok with that?
Doesn't matter does it? I am going to see my teams.
Ok the bills and patriots I get, but why the dolphins?
You forgot the jets, and because I like them.
No I didn't I just didn't want to mention them.
Josh McCown, how bout that?
Ok, hes a decent player.
Actually I can't believe they are going to bench Hackenberg.
Gee, I wonder why.
You know why, don't judge.
Look if a football player can't hold it together, he should be removed.
Why?
If they make that much money, they should atleast be playing.
You try playing football.
You try picking different teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright my man, let's talk about the NFC North.
Alright, but first we need to acknowledge a mistake we made. When we talked about the NFC South,  we left off Tampa Bay and included the Rams!!!
Oh man ! What a mistake! Ivery get to revise my picks!  Winston is good enoughere to get them in the playoffs this year!
Agrees!  Revised standings for the South NO, TB in a wildcard, ATL then CAR in last.
Okay, on to the North. We already know the Bears aint going to do nothing,
Yeah 3-13 if they are lucky.
GB is the standard bearer there. Aaron Rodgers can not be stopped.
I know that's right! GB will be the number one seed for the NFC.
So we got #1and #4 figured out.
So where do we put Detroit and Minnesota?
I don't know man. Who is going to start at QB for the Vikings?
That's tough! Bridgewater or Bradford? Two qbs equals no qbs.
And AP gone to New Orleans!  I can't see them co.peting this year.
I dont know you might be right.
Detroit is still a threat as long as they have Matthew Stafford.
Yep. I dont care who they play. I'm always happy to watch them on Thanksgiving Day
Its a tradition for sure.
So I'm going GB, DET, MIN, and CHI way back
Way back indeed! Cutler gone and they don't know if Glennon or Trubisky  will start.
It doesn't matter! They are still the Bears!! Hahaha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you have making the playoffs this year?
For the AFC or NFC?
Either one works. What teams will dominate in the NFL this season?
I think the Raiders, Patriots, and Seahawks will be the dominant teams.
What about the Ravens, Steelers, and Bengals?
They all reside in a tough division and they don't piqué my interest.
I think they might surprise you this year.
I think the Dolphins will surprise us.
The Dolphins look like they might be alright, perhaps this will be their year.
I love how the NFL has such high parity.
Well, except for the Patriots.
Of course, they are good every season.
Tom Brady really is a mastermind.
I heard he is coming out with a book about his fitness and mental health.
It looks interesting - might reveal how he has been so successful.
Yes, I think so. What do you think of the Revis situation?
I bet it is driving Belichick insane.
Yes, I bet it is.
He seems like a guy that worries over every detail.
He is meticulous and sly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder who the oungest QB to win the superbowl is...
You and your questions
I'm curious, Curiosity is good
Curiosity killed the cat, anyway, Roethlisberger was 23, when he won it for the steelers.
Who's the youngest QB, period?
Mariota and Winston are both 22.
They have no chance of being the youngest QBs to win the superbowl, then
Nope. There is no way Titans or Buccaneers will be a superbowl winning teams within this year.
Haha, yeah. Huh. I think being the youngest QB to win the superboal is more impressive then.
It's a rare thing, but not more impressive, it's mostly luck.
Why do you say that?
Because you have to be a good QB, and happened to be drafted by superbowl winning caliber team.
Oh, right, you sort fo have to be in the right place at the right time.
Yep. But given good enough QBs, it takes time to build a superbowl caliber team around him.
Huh. what do you know.
But, they are getting younger on the average
How so?
Well, the average age of Superbowl winning QBs from 1998-2012 was around 28 or so
That's kinda similar to the average age of the superbowl winning team.
Yep, which happens to be aroudn 27 or so. it just take time for these players to develop into that caliber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is going to win the AFC west this season?
Kansas City for sure.
What about the NFC South?
The Saints will easily win that division.
You don't think Brees is getting to old?
No, and Matt Ryan is good but he doesn't have a super bowl winning team around him
What about Cam Newton in Carolina?
He's ok, but he doesn't have the receiving corps to catch the ball.
Who has the best defense?
Probably Atlanta.
Who do you have winning the NFC East?
The Giants, Eli has got everything in place to win
But they have no defense.
They don't need defense, their offense is that good.
No, man, defense wins championships.
You can't score points on defense, you need points to win..
Yes you can, its called a pick-6 or a fumble recovered in the endzone.
Oh, yeah, i forgot about that... and safeties too
Exactly.. to build a great team you have to start with a good defense.
I can't wait for the pre-season to start.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Dolphins had a pretty good year, don't you think?
Yeah, they weren't bad.
Didn't they make the playoffs?
I think so, but got bounced by the Patriots or something.
I sometimes forget that Suh is on their team.
That guy is a menace.
He is, but I'm not sure he's worth the money.
Yeah, they paid him a truckload.
But he's not really producing a whole lot with stats.
He's probably freeing up some other defensive players more I think.
Yeah, like Cameron Wake.  He's underrated.
I like him, but he's on the wrong side of 30 now.
On the offensive side, Tannenhill seems like he's doing okay.
He was pretty solid last year.  Had some trouble with accuracy.
I think he always has.
But he's got young legs and that keeps them in some games.
I really like their running back.
You mean Jay Ajayi?  Yeah, great pick.
He's speedy, makes good cuts, just a good player.
He was a good example of drafting running backs low and getting maximum production from them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best TD in NFL history?
The Packers wide receiver Max McGee back in 1967.
Whoa!! You went way back with that one.
Yeah I did. But he did a one hander in 37 yards. I never seen nothing like that since then.
No I think when Odell Beckham Jr made a TD with 21 yards. No that was a TD!!
I remember that. That was actually a few recent years ago.
Yeah it was actually back in 2015 when his team played against the Redskins.
You sure it was 21 yards?
Oh course it was. He is one of my favorite player so I certain it was 21 yards.
Oh ok. But I got one even better than Odell.
Oh yeah. Tell me about it.
Do you remember when AJ Green of the Bengals did a TD with 48 yards?
No I actually don't remember that one.
Yeah it was incredible.
But I do remember when he scored an 80 yard TD when they played against the Ravens.
No that TD was even better. Now I did watch that game.
Yeah and the 66 yard TD when AJ Green played against the Steelers.
I think I almost pissed in my pants during that game out of excitement.
I was watching it at a friends home and it was the highlight of the night.
Now I can agree with you on that one. AJ Green is one of the best WR of the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how stoked are you about the NFL fotbll this season?
Oh I am so ready!!!
Me too, I wish the season was longer!
Yeah now that would be great!
I am really looking forward to seeing what the 49er's are going to do this year.
You and your 49er's, come on Joe Montana has been gone for many years.
So you don't give up on your team just because the best quarterback ever retired!
Oh OK best ever right, WRONG!
Oh I forgot you are a Brady fan.
Look all the great players San Fransisco had are gone. Rice, Montana retired.
So what they still have a lot of great players and I know this is going to be their year.
Especially since they are getting a new starting QB
New talent is always a plus, it is about who plays well and who has the desire to win.
Your right, and with that I can say MY team is going all the way and you will be crying again.
Yeah Yeah I hear you trash talking, but the season hasn't started yet and you will see.
Ya I will see you crying when they do not make the play-offs.
Well we will see the Patriots do have a good team, but I think you are going to be surprised by a few teams, not just my guys.
You say that every year and every year my guys are Superbowl bound.
Well we will see, first game is at your house this year.
I know and I can't wait ti you see the new "sports room" with a new HUGE TV so we can see every play up close!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready?
For the upcoming NFL season? You know it!
Well, yeah but ready to see some OU Sooners getting some pro action?
Always! It's really great to see these kids get an opportunity to follow their dreams beyond high school and college football.
Yeah, that's always great though... not a fan of any teams that picked them up. Dede Westbrook made it on Jaguars then Samaje Perine  made Redskins and...
Then the two that went to the Bengals. Joe Mixon and Jordan Evans.
Ugh, definitely not a Begnals fan in the slightest.
Same though I did catch a few of their games last season. That October game against the Redskins was intense!
Okay I will agree that was a fun one to watch. Can't believe they tied in overtime.
Yeah, don't see that too often. Think it was... 27 to 27 if I remember correctly.
Really looking forward to seeing the Broncos in action this year. They had a great season last year... as always... but will be interesting to see how they do without Peyton Manning.
It certainly won't be the same without Manning but he should have retired a few seasons back don't you think.
Maybe... but if it was me I would have wanted to stay in as long as possible. Enjoy it "just one more year" y'know?
I guess. Was a real shame that Marshaw Lynch retired also.
Actually, I heard he was coming back.
Really?
Yeah. I think the Raiders picked him up.
Oh wow, that was unexpected. Had him on my fantasy team last season but that injury killed me for a few weeks.
Same here. Hopefully he's back in 100% beast mode this season.
Definitely following the Raiders a lot more closely this year to find out. Been a few years since I've kept up with them so should be interesting.

Hi.
Hi.
Do you watch a lot of football?
Yeah I do.  Do you?
Yeah.
Do you watch college or nfl or both?
I usually watch both.
Same here.
Who is your favorite player right now in the NFL?
Hmm tough question.
Sure take your time.
I like Odell Beckham a lot.
The Giants wide receiver?
Yeah that's him.
His hair is great.
Yeah and he can catch just about any pass you throw to him.
Yeah that too.
I like the seahawks quaterback a lot.
Russell Wilson?
Yeah that's him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Love it!
Oh?  Who's your favorite team?
Dolphins
The fish!?
Yea man!
Why them?  They're terrible!
Dude I'm from Florida
But still!  Terrible team!
Oh?  and I assume you're a Pats fan?
Of course!  Gotta love them!
Don't you mean hate?
Nah, way better than Miami
Better yes, but unfair
Haha!  So much hate for them lately
Well what do you expect when you cheat?
Not proven
Rigged...
XXXXXXXXXXX
aside from Tom Brady, who do you think the best quarterbacks were in the 2016 season
I think you definitely need to include Aaron Rodgers on the list
I would agree with that. he had like 40 touchdowns in 2016
Matt Ryan obviously deserves to be on the list, even though he lost the big game
yes, he put some monster numbers. he averaged something like 309 yard per game
that is insane. most quarterbacks would kill for those numbers
who else do you think should make the best of 2016 list
this might be controversial, but Dallas Cowboys Dak Prescott had an excellent rookie year
lets see if he can repeat that performance now that there is some game tape of him
he had about 23 touchdowns and only 4 interceptions. he does a really good job of protecting the football, and found ways to help the cowboys win games
plus he is a rushing threat. he racked up close to 230 yards per game
another quarterback to watch based on his 2016 performance is Derek Carr
he made the Raiders look really good last year. Their offense was pretty high power all things considered
he completion rate was pretty solid at 64%, and his 28 TDs were pretty impressive
If the Raiders get a few more offensive weapons next year they could be really dangerous
back to QBs... another one that makes the 2016 list is Drew Brees
Oh for sure. he really spread around the football among his receiving core. it feels like he was always finding different targets in the endzone
ha. so true. he would throw 5 touchdowns in a game, to 5 different receivers
an honorable mention should probably go to Ben Roethlisberger as well. he put up 29 TDs and about 272 yards per game
Go Big Ben!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you know when the Steelers first game is?
Let me look it up.
Awsome.
Yes it is September 10 at 12:00.
Does it say who they play?
Yes Cleveland Browns.
That should be an easy win for us.
I hope but i have seen them struggle before.
I hope not it would be awful if we lost our first game to the Browns.
I know it rarely happens.
I remember when the mayor of Pittsburgh and Cleveland would bet something for the games as a kind of riverly.
I remember that it was a fun thing to do.
Is the game at home or Cleveland?
It looks like its at home.
When is the next game
It is September 17 against the Vikings and it is also at noon.
I would like to go see the Pittsburgh Cleveland game.
Maybe we could go up for the weekend.
Yes a weekend vacation for us girls.
Good lets start getting things in order.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like the Patriots and Seahawks could meet in the superbowl if everyone stays healthy.
Yea, I agree, but I would bet more on the Seahawks.
Yea, I think you might be wrong about that one. The Patriots are still at their peak.
I mean, you are right, but Seattle is too.
Yea, Seattle just has been in the news for more bad things lately. Like Richard Sherman's antics.
Yea, he has a to just chill. He is smart, but needs to tone it down.
Yea, but he hasn't to this point and I doubt he ever will.
I agree, but he is still a great player.
Yea, well both teams should have good years.
Yea, I'm not sure if anyone can challenge the patriots in the AFC either honestly.
Yea, I feel like there are more good teams in the NFC this year.
It does feel that way. More competition too.
Well, maybe some teams will step up.
Yea, like Tennessee and Miami. Its about time they both show up.
Yea, they both have good young quarterbacks.
Yea, but one may not actually be good.
I am not sure about Tannehill. Maybe this is the year he really shows what he can do.
I hope so! He has a lot of receivers around him.
Well, we know what Mariota can do.
Yes, we found that out at times last year. I want to see more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Sure do!
Cool, cool!
What team is your favorite?
The Patriots.  You?
The Bills
Oh, man.  Why the Pats?
They are winners, man!
Well, true.  But any other reason?
I like Tom Brady
Yea, he's a great athlete
I agree!
But he cheats
I dont know about that!
Well there's a lot of evidence
Yea, there is a bit!
Good talk man!
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Almost time for the NFL season!
Indeed! Training camp starts soon, doesn't it.
Yes, July 22nd. And the first preseason game is August 3rd.
When does the regular season start?
September 7th. First game of the season is the Chiefs at the Patriots.
That should be a good game. The Chiefs have been surprisingly good the last few years.
Yeah, they went 12-4 last season. Lost the divisional playoff to the Steelers.
I'm a Packers fan. Who do they play week 1?
They're at home vs the Seahawks for their first game.
Man, I have hated the Seahawks ever since the Fail Mary game.
Which was that?
It was a 2012 Packers-Seahawks game played with the replacement refs.
Oh, right! They didn't call pass interference so the Seahawks won.
Exactly. The thought of that game still makes my blood boil a bit!
That's understandable.
This week one Giants at Cowboys game should be interesting too.
Man, I am so curious to see how the Cowboys do this year.
Yeah, putting all their chips on Dak Prescott.
I hope for their sake he doesn't get a case of the sophomore slumps!
If he does, you can bet Tony Romo will be laughing all the way to the bank.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a season ticket holder for any NFL teams?
Yes, I'm a big Dallas Cowboys fan - I go to most of their games.
Hey, how about that - I live in Austin and I'm a Cowboys fan too - great franchise.
Yeah, it's a family affair with the Cowboys - we've been going since I was a kid.
AT&T Stadium is a great venue for them to play in.
Yeah, I preferred it when they called it Cowboys stadium, but I guess you have to have corporate sponsors of some kind.
I really like the dome - makes the games fun to watch in any weather condition.
True, and the screen is enormous - I think that it adds a lot to the Cowboys experience.
It will be interesting to see how Kellen Moore performs as Quarterback.
Yeah, too bad Tony Romo left, but I always have high hopes for the Cowboys.
Terrance Williams is a great wide receiver and I think the new contract was a smart move.
Jason Garrett is a great head coach - makes great decisions for the team.
Did you know that Kellen Moore is the only left-handed quarterback in the NFL?
Really - how about that?  I wonder if that has an advantages for a quarterback?
Which match up are you looking forward most this season?
I think Cowboys versus Packers will be a great game.
Yeah, I will have friends over for that game - they are die-hard Packers fans!
That will be a fun day!
Super Bowl XXX in 1995 was the last time the Cowboys won the championship - I hope they can do it again.
Me too - I will be the first in line for Super Bowl tickets!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you excited that its almost time for the NFL season to start?
Yeah, July is the last month there isnt any football on for the rest of the year, I think!
I know, what is your favorite team?
Mine is the Green Bay Packers.
They are pretty good, I am partial to the Redskins.
That must be difficult.
Yeah, believe me, it seems like they destroy everything good they touch.
Oh yeah, whatever happened to RG3?
He was injured like every 5 minutes and then left for the Browns.
The Browns? Thats like the Titanic of the NFL, there's no escape.
Tell me about it. If I were Kirk Cousins I would be planning my escape 24/7.
Does that one guy who everyone hates still own the team?
Daniel Snyder? You bet, he's micromanaging the team into oblivion.
How's the new coach working out?
He's pretty good, he's the brother of the guy on Monday Night Football.
Oh I like him, Jon Gruden?
Yeah - I'm hopeful this year maybe we can make the playoffs.
I'm hopeful we can win the Super Bowl.
Well you have Aaron Rodgers, so anything is possible lol.
Yeah he's one of the best quarterbacks I've ever seen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about football?
As in NFL football?
Yea, the NFL.
My favorite sport to watch!
Why do you like it best?
I guess tailgating
Haha!  That's awesome!
Yea me and my bros do it up before the games!
Sounds fun to me!
Oh, it's a blast!
Lots of friends?
Probably like eight or so of us depending.
A good sized group
It is.  Lots of beer
Oh I bet!  Anything worth mentioning?
Nah just Natty Ice
Natty Ice!?
Yea I know, water beer but it's cheap
Can't deny that1
Definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Are you kidding?  Less than two months til pre-season--can't wait!
Me neither, man.  I've been to a couple of open training camps.
Yeah, I've been to the Cowboys training camp in Oxnard myself earlier this year.
Autographs, cheerleaders and everything?
You bet. Man, you should see Dallas' passing game in practice.
Impressive?  With Romo gone, you gotta wonder will Prescott start.
You gotta wonder.  He reminds me of Theismann.
Those were the days!  Remember when NFL players were paid like regular people.
Ha!  My dad got Jethro Pugh's autograph at a sporting goods store where he worked in the off-season.
Times were sure different then.  I remember ol' 88 on the Cowboys Drew Pearson...
... was a sportscaster on a Dallas radio station!  Said he sure as heck wouldn't be doing that if he got paid like the kids today!
Speaking of old NFL players, I met a old dude yesterday whose dad sold cars to Doak Walker and Bobby Lane.
That IS speaking of old NFL... the golden age of the NFL.
Dandy Don and Hollywood--
Henderson?  You know he won the Texas lottery twice after he retired.
Do you always think of Dallas?  I was referring to Hollywood Joe Willy Namath.
Well, you mentioned Don Meredith so I thought you were still talking Cowboys, yo.
I could, you know. I could go on and on about any team in the NFL.
But the Cowboys are your favorite! Have a good night.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How good do you think Denver will be this year.
I think they can bounce back this season.
Think they can win 10 games.
I do,but it might not get them into the playoffs.
They have a tough schedule.
Yes,very tough.
They start out with chargers and then the cowboys.
They should beat the chargers and they're home with the cowboys.
Then buffalo and the raiders.
Could be a 2-2 start.
Week five is a bye.
That's an early bye week.
Yes it is.
Then the Giants come to Denver.
Another tough game.
Then the chargers again and then the chiefs,eagles and New England.
Wow,they do have a tough schedule.
They finish with Cincinnati,Oakland,Miami,jets,colts,redskins and chiefs again l
Ten wins will be tough.
Yes,very tough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did they before the Superbowl?
What do you mean?
Did they have national championship for the NFL?
Well, they didn't really have a national championship, per se. They had the National Football League and the American Football League
They had the championships individually?
Well, it's a little more complicated than that. The merger required some kind of championship.
When was the merger?
Merger was announced back in 1966, then they had their own seasons until 1969, and merged completely in 1970. That was the first superbowl season.
And the reson they merged?
They were competing aginst each other for college players, and the salaries went skyrocketing. They raided other conferences for players too.
Always it comes down to money.
Of course, so once they merged under the same rules, the raids stopped, they still traded players, of course.
I see. So the championbship between the leagues is basically what superbowl is?
Yes
Hm. I loved last years superbowl,. It was the biggest comeback win in history
25 points. That's Brady forya
Which is amazing because he wasn't drafted until round 6, pick 199.
Yeah, pick 199 out of 254 players picked that year. There was a reddit post while back about his resume
Haha, yeah I saw that.
He was an intern at Merryl Lynch. Good thing patriots picked him up,. otherwise, we woulnd't have our second 5 times Superbowl Champion
XXXXXXXXXXX
Say whatever happened to Tim Tebow?
I think he went and tried out baseball
Oh, how is he doing on that?
I really have no idea
So what are your predictions on which teams are going to be on top this year
I think it's going to be Pats, Ravens, Colts, Chiefs on the AFC
I agree, that sounds about right
For the NFC, I think Eagles, Packers, Panthers and Seahawks
Really, I disagree about the Eagles, I think it's going to be the Giants.
Maybe, way to early to tell though
Who do you think might end up being MVP
I have no clue, a few good quarterbacks to chose from, anyone can surprise you
It just better not be Brady, I am so sick of hearing his name
I 100% agree
How long do you think Mike Mcarthey will be coaching
I don't know, seems like he has been coaching the Pack forever
I hope he stays, he is a good coach
So do I
What about Ted Thompson
He has been around ever since I started watching the Pack many years ago. I don't know if he should stay or go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you excited for the new NFL preseaon?
Yes, I can not wait to see new player and teams.
Me too, I want to know of the new trades.
I hope my favorite teams get some new talent.
Same here, the Patriots last year had the best season so far.
That's true they did. I hope my team the Chargers have a great year.
I know right. I really want Tom Brady to take the team to the superbowl again.
That would be nice but I would prefer to see the chargers there.
Do you think your team will get any new players?
I really hope so. The draft gave the team some fresh talent.
Same here for the Patriots.
Yeah, but as always we will have to see what the seasn brings.
Of course. I reall cant wait for the preseason to begin.
Yeah, it will be nice to visit San Diego to see what changes the team will be making this year.
Yeah I reall enjoy traveling to Foxborough to watch the preseason games.
Yeah, there is something about just my team work out the team kinks before the regular season.
Thats true. Previous years Tom Brady had used diffrent recievers and running backs.
Every year he always has a new go-to guy.
It will be great to see who he uses this years.
I fee the same about Rivers and the Chargers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They both should be pretty good, but the Patriots have shown no signs off slowing down.
You are right about that. They just don't quit.
Yea, well they some how seem to make the right trades and just moves in general.
Yea, they clearly know how to build a team.
They are consistently picking at the back of the draft, yet consistently find players that make plays.
It seems like every week, they have new players step up and make plays.
Yea, that could be due to how their pratice.
I agree, but whatever it is, it works.
I'm with you on that one. I just can never count out the Patriots.
Yea, I know what you mean. I just feel like eventually age will catch up.
Well, it always does at some point, but I'm not sure its ready yet.
Yea, we will find out.
Hopefully they Steelers will challenge the Patriots this year.
Yea, there aren't too many teams out there that can challenge them.
Yea, but they are one.
They sure are, but they have to stay healthy as well.
Yea and avoid suspensions. Both have been tough for them.
Yea, especially for Leveon Bell. The kid can't stay on the field.
Yea, he needs to learn to stay out of trouble.
I agree! He's too good to be doing silly stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man! Did you see where the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Tim Tebow to replace Bortles?
What?! What are you talking about?  They did not!
Haha! Naw, they didnt! I'm just messing with you.  But they should have.  Jacksonville I'd going to bad again this year.
Ha! Quite true. They will be the worst team in the NFLs worst division if you ask me.
Yeah, the Jags, Colts, Texans, and the Titans. Who do you see winning that division?
Well starting at the bottom, as I said will be Jacksonville.
And working your way up?
Argh! It's tough. I'm torn between Houston and Indy.
What? You don't trust Andrew Luck?
Oh I trust him! But he has absolutely nothing to work with!
That's true.it's such a shame to see him wasting away there. Imagine him with Houston or Denver!
He is one of the very best and is being wasted. I think Deshon Watson will start early and lead Houston to 9-7 and a potential playoff spot.
Interesting. You think he's already ready?
I do. Out of Watson , Trubisky, and Mahonnes, I think Watson will prove to be the most field ready
Yeah but our boy Mahonnes in KC will be the first to win a Superbowl! !!
Word! But not this year. He will lead KC to glory in a about 3 years.
Well, who is going to win it all this year?
Calm down. I'm getting there. The team that will lose the Superbowl this year is the Tennessee Titans.
Wow! You think they will make it that far?
I do. It's Marcus Marriotas 3rd year, and the have made all the right off season moves. They will make it only to lose to...the Green Bay Packers
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Super Bowl this year?
Sort of. I went to a Super Bowl party but I mostly just pay attention to see the commercials when the Super Bowl is on.
Are you not a football fan?
No, I'm not a huge fan. Are you?
I am! I love football!
Who is your favorite team?
I really love the New England Patriots.
They seem like a pretty good team.
Yeah, Tom Brady is one of the best players of all time.
He's one of the few professional football players I know of, so he must be!
Which other players are you aware of?
Hmm, I've heard of Colin Kapernick, Peyton and Eli Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Tony Romo, and Tim Tebow.
Yeah, they're all famous but not all of them are active players right now.
What do you mean?
Well, Tony Romo actually just retired this year, and Peyton Manning retired last year.
Is Eli Manning still active?
Yeah. He's on the New York Giants right now I'm pretty sure.
What about Tim Tebow?
He's not officially retired I don't think but his career in the NFL seems pretty much over.
Wow. I guess I don't know a lot about the NFL at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What NFL team is your favorite?
The New Orleans Saints
Never really been a big Saints fan.
What team is your favorite?
I'm from San Diego so I've been a Chargers fan my entire life.
How do you feel about the Chargers moving to Los Angeles?
Man I hate it, it really pisses me off how easily an NFL team can be rooted away from a city.
Yeah but the NFL is in it for the money. They really could care less about their fans.
Oh you're 100% correct. Look what happened to the St. Louis Rams and the Oakland Raiders.
I actually feel pretty bad for Raiders fans, they have a very loyal fan base.
Yup but at the same time it's pretty cool Las Vegas is getting a NFL team.
I guess so but I think fans should have a voice in these type of decesions.
Weren't the Saints about to move cities a few years ago.
Mhm rite after Hurricane Katrina.
What happened with that?
Basically the owner Tom Benson wanted to move the team to San Antonio after the hurricane unless certain demands were met.
What demands did Benson have?
He wanted the Superdome to undergo some serious renovantions and wanted a high tech new practice facility built for the team.
Well I'm assuming he got what he wanted.
He sure did and I'm very satisified with all the upgrades in the Superdome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the Raiders ever win a Super Bowl?
Yes, back in 1977
Oh for the 1977 season?
No, for the 1976 season.
Oh, but they play the Super Bowl in 1977 because it's in February.
Yes, but it was in January back then.
I see. Who did they play back then?
The Vikings.
Oh man, the Vikings lost a lot of Super Bowls back in the day.
Yes, they did.
Who was the coach of the Raiders back then?
The legendary John Madden
Oh wow, he's been around.
Yeah, that was his only win as well.
Well he's sure milking that win
Yes he is. Parlayed it into a great broadcasting career.
I never was a fan.
Really? I thought he was great.
I thought he was too goofy.
Oh no way. Loved his euphemisms.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite sport?
I would have to say the NFL without a doubt.
Yea that would be my pick as well!
Do you follow any particular team?
Yes, I grew up as a huge fan of the Philadelphia Eagles.
My uncle used to be a big fan of theirs back in the Buddy Ryan days.
My dad did as well, we love Ryan to this day!
What did you think about Chip Kelly?
I had high expectations,but they came crashing down pretty quick!
I thought Kelly was a home run hire when I first heard the news.
Me to! He was so great at Oregon that I just knew he was going to do the same for my Eagles.
How do you feel about the hire of Doug Pederson?
I am not sure just yet, he seems like a decent fit; but I thought the same about Kelly as well.
Where did he coach before the Eagles made him their choice?
He was the offensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs.
I thought he was an offensive coordinator for someone.
Yea, I guess we will see what this upcoming season will hold for him and the eagles.
What would have to happen for you to define the upcoming season a success?
I would at least like to see us make the playoffs. I would be happy with that.
We will see soon, the new season is not to far away!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So Ryan Tannenhill is returning for another season for Miami.
So i see, looks like he's got some  good 2nd and 3rd string players as well.
Who are they?
Well, there is Matt More.
Oh yeah, he covered Tannenhill a lot last season.
I remember, Then there is David Fales.
He's new, right?
I think so.
Brandon Dourghty is trying to make a play for third string.
Is he any good?
I don't know, i never heard of him.
hm.
Well, if they let Moore play even more this season i think getting to the playoffs won't be a problem.
I know. They got there last season but was shut down early.
I remember. I was bummed out after seeing Jacksonville and Tampa not making it.
Yes, it's hard for Florida teams to make it to the playoffs and hold it.
Hopefully it will be different this year.
Well, i dont see Jacksonville making the grade.
Yeah, hoping Miami makes it to the playoffs again this season
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How have you been doing lately?
I am just keeping myself busy until football season rolls around.
Do you still follow the NFL?
I sure do! It is my favorite!
I remember when you were little you used to love the San Francisco 49ers.
I still do! They have always been my favorite team.
I can remember us watching that Superbowl they won together.
Me to, that is one of my fondest memories!
What year was that when they won the big game?
It was in 1995, that was the last year they won the Superbowl.
I thought they had won it a few years ago when John Harbaugh was the coach.
No, they got to the Superbowl but lost to the Baltimore Ravens.
That sure was a great team they had back in 95, huh?
I think it is one of the best teams of all time; even though most people underrate them quite a bit.
Was Joe Montana still the quarterback at that point in time?
No Steve Young was the quarterback for that particular team.
That is right, he turned out to be great in his own right however.
He sure did! He could hurt you with his arms and his legs.
Then of course you also had Jerry Rice on that team as well.
The best receiver to ever lace them up in my mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do think of the controversy over the Washington NFL's team's nickname?
That gets political and I don't like to talk politics, but I do get a kick out of team names.
How so?
Well, like how they don't always make sense--like the Utah Jazz.  Utah and jazz?
Well, that's because the team moved from New Orleans--I don't know why they didn't change the name, but that's basketball.  Any NFL names that amuse you.
Well, most of them make sense, but what about the Buffalo Bills--are the named after Buffalo Bill Cody?
And the Houston Texans--what creative genius came up with that?
We could have the San Francisco Californians.
And the Seattle Washingtonians.
And then there are the New Orleans Saints
Whats wrong with that--maybe related to music and New Orleans and "When the Saints Come Marching In".
I don't know--are you intimidated by a team of Saints?
I guess you wouldn't be too fearful of the Dolphins either.
Well, they are big and they relate to Florida, so I'll give that one a pass.
What about the New England Patriots?
Well, a patriot seems more like a concept than a mascot, but that's not what bothers me about that team name.
What does?
New England--that's not a city; it's an area.
You're right--every other team belongs to a city.
Yeah, I'm going to the game; where do I go; oh I don't know--New England.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey - I can't wait for the new NFL Season - how about you?
Me too - I am a NFL fanatic - its the best sport for sure.
I really love the early fall when it all gets going, the hype, the info everything.
Yes - I am pretty glued to Sportscenter once the season gets underway.
Yeah, Im the same its the only time I watch sports on TV - the NFL season.
Do you ever go to any games at the stadium?
No - if the Broncos came to town I might try to get tickets though
Are they your favorite NFL team?
Yes the Broncos and the Redskins.
Thats funny I love the redskins too, watch as many games as I can.
They are a huge disappointment though every year.
Thats for sure - I still watch though and hope and watch Patriots games too since I live up near Boston now
Well you have one great team there as long as Brady and Bellichek are together!
Yeah - every year its seems they have a shot at the post season playoffs.
I always love watching my Broncos play against them - normally a great game
Yeah those few Brady - Manning games recently were classics.
Yeah the NFL had to love those matchups and what that did for fan attention.
And you know you couldnt find two better representatives of the NFL than those two - Brady and Manning
You think so - despite deflategate. That didnt affect Brady?
No that whole DeflateGate thing was all hype and BS - it happened all the time. The NFL just made a big deal out of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi

For sure I am ready
This games gonna be tight
Yeah it will

Makes sense they are expensive
Indeed they are
But your here now
And excited
Let the tail gating commence
Let's do

What football scandals do you remember?
Oh, there's been so many....
Aaron Hernandez being like, the top one.
Yeah, it's such a shame what happened to him.
I don't think we've ever seen anyone in the NFL get life and then kill themselves.
Nope, definetely a first.
Rest in peace to him, but overall.....he shouldn't have done what he did.
Agreed.
I think another crazy scandal was obviously the Deflate gate.
I don't recall that one, what was it again?
The Patriots were accused of deflating their balls a little to affect how they were thrown.
Oh thats horrible, did they do it for real?
Oh, definetely. I'm pretty sure they got suspended for a while.
Brady must have been pissed.
Yeah, but they all deserved it.
True, you would just have yourself to blame for that.
I'm sure they weren't the only team to ever do something like that though.
Sure, football has been around forever, honestly.
I just know that rulebreakers like that always get caught eventually.
Yep, can't hide from nothing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team is your favorite?
I'm a fan of the Chargers.
Cool, Im a big fan of the Packers.
I don't like the Packers very much. I do respect Aaron Rodgers though.
Yeah we would be pretty bad without him.
We would also be bad without Rivers. Any players that you're looking forward to watching this year.
Yeah I'm excited for Martellus Bennet. I was amazed we signed a new free agent.
Yeah he will go well with Rodgers. I'm really hoping Melving Gordon can have another good yeah.
I'd like to see him do well, I was a fan of his on college. How do you think the Chargers will do this year?
I think they'll play really well but fall short of a wild card. How about you?
I think we should be able to win the division again. It's too bad your team's conference is so tough.
Yeah, that makes it hard for them to make the playoffs. Yours doesn't seem too bad does it?
No, unless one of the other teams surprises everyone, then we shouldn't have it too tough.
So who do you think will win the Super Bowl?
Thats tough but I have to say the Patriots. I think they'll end up playing us.
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they won. I'm not sure who I would pick in the NFC.
Do you ever bet on football at all?
No I don't, but I know a few people that do.
I like to. Last year went well for me.
Thats cool, most people seem to lose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you like football?
Yeah sure do.  Big NFL fan.
Oh cool.
How about you?
Yeah I like it a lot as well.
Do you have a favorite team?
Not really, I just like watching exciting games.
Oh okay.
What about you?
I like the Giants.
Cool.
Yep.
I watch a lot of games on Redzone, that is the most fun.
Yeah I love Redzone when I'm just flicking around.
Or when the Giants aren't playing.
Yeah exactly.
Good talking to you.
Likewise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Soon enough the 2017 NFL season will start!
Are you going to get a jump on it and go down to Mankato for the Vikings training camp?
I never thought about it.
You should, I'm not even a fan but I hear it's fun.
You know anyone who has gone?
Yes, I have a friend who goes every year.
Does he like it?
Yes. Tickets are so expensive now that the only way to see the players play for free is at training camp.
That makes sense.
Plus, you can get close enough to ask for a selfie or autograph.
Now I have to go!
Yeah, he takes his nephew and the neighbor kid along so they can see their favorite players.
Are they big NFL fans?
Yes, Of course they both want to be professional football players when they grow up.
So did I.
Of course they won't make it.
You never know. Remember you know some pro players since you were young before they made it and you didn't think they would make it either.
That's true. Even after they made it I look back to when they were saying one day they'd be pro football players and I STILL don't think they'll make it.
So cynical.
Yes, I am.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been getting ready for the new Fantasy season?
Not really, I've got a lot of studying to do still.
You should get on that! Everyone's been getting really intense with it.
Ya, everyone usually does haha.
I'm still not sure who I want my first pick to be, There's so many good choices.
Ya, I'm not really sure either, I was thinking about maybe getting Gronk or Brady.
Those are good players, but I'm not sure if that's the route you should go.
What makes you say that?
I'm just not sure if they're good first picks ya know?
I guess so.
They just might not get as many points as some other choices.
Ya, you're right, I definitely need to do some research.
Ya, we're going to have a draft party in about 2 weeks.
Oh really? Is everyone going to be there?
Ya of course! We got a nice 4K TV just for this season.
Oh that sounds awesome! I guess I'll have to start doing some research, huh?
Ya, I would get on that, we're upping the stakes this year too.
Oh really? Are we putting in more money than normal?
Ya, everyone is thinking about putting in $50 so there's a huge prize pool.
That sounds cool, I'm definitely game for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Superbowl last night?
Yeah, that was an insane game.
I can't believe the Patriots came back from from that deficit.
I know! Tom Brady really had to carry his team to victory in the second half.
At the same time though you have to feel for the Falcons.
Yeah that must have been rough to lose that.
How do you throw away a 21-3 lead though?
I know right. All you have to do is play a really conservative defense and you should be fine.
I actually stopped watching at half time because I though it was over. But then my brother called me back in after the 3rd quarter.
Well it's a good thing you dint miss the fourth quarter!
I know! It was crazy to watch the Patriot score 19 points in the last quarter.
I guess Brady just really wanted it.
Yeah. I'm not a huge fan of Brady, but credit where credit it due. That guy is insane.
He completely took over that game that last quarter.
Not just the last quarter! The entire second half!
He was playing really well in overtime too.
Yeah he really just outclassed Matt Ryan.
I think outclasses everyone in the NFL at the moment.
Lets hope the next Superbowl is as good as this one.
I wish every game was as good as this Superbowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you say is the best player in the NFL?
Can I pick a non-Quarterback?
Sure, if you think that's truly the best player.
Then I'm picking J.J. Watt.
He had a down year last year.
I know, he battled an injury. But I think he's the most dominant force in the game.
He's a game changer.
What about you? Who would you pick?
For me, it has to be a quarterback.
It's the most important position, but I don't think it necessarily means the best player plays there.
I see your argument, but I'm going with Aaron Rodgers.
Not Tom Brady?
Brady is great, but I think he benefits greatly from scheme and overall talent around him.
Hmm, I'm not sure I agree about the talent. The Patriots tend to mix and match a lot of teams' rejects on offense.
Gronkowski isn't anyone's reject!
Gronk was hurt a lot last year, and the Patriots still rolled.
Look, I'm not saying Brady isn't an elite QB, just that I'd take Rodgers over him.
I'd take either Brady OR Rodgers over J.J. Watt, but I think Watt is the superior player.
Huh? How does that make sense?
He plays a less important position.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for football season?
Yes my son has been so excited since he kinda understands it now and he can watch with his dad.
My kids are ready for the Sunday football partys the guys have.
Are your kids rooting for any one special?
Definatly everyones with the Saints and i want the Steelers to go to the play offs.
My husband wants the Saints to win every year.
Do you remind him how bad they are.
I remind him how sad his quarter back is.
That is true i dont care for Drew Brees eigther.
My husband and kids think he is the quarter back god.
They need to see Peyton Manning or Tom Brady theres a quarterback for them to admire.
Oh no my husband hates Tom Brady and the Patriots.
I dont care for Bill Belicheck the coach but i think Tom Bradys a very talented player.
I have heard that Bill Bellicheck has been accused of cheating before.
Yes i remember hearing about that before something about playbooks or something.
I have heard my family complain about it but Bellicheck never got in trouble from the NFL so i assumed it didnt happen.
I dont know i just like to watch and rub it in when my team is doing great and his cant even make it to the playoffs.
I know that is the best part and the kids hate it when my team wins.
Maybe we can get both familys together for a game.
That would be fun for us and the kids lets make a weekend of it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Steelers are gonna win it all this year!
They'd better, Ben ain't getting any younger.
I think he's got one more in him, just like Bettis.
I miss Jerome Bettis.
I miss Terry Bradshaw.
Those were the days!
Swann and Stallworth were the greatest.
I think both of them are in the Hall of Fame.
Mean Joe Greene was awesome too.
Do you remember his Coke commercial?
Yes! And Jack Lambert was a force!
The steel curtain was dominant.
Neil O'Donnell years were fun too.
Yes, we still have the most Superbowl rings.
What's your favorite Steelers game.
It's a loss actually, but it's funny.
What is that?
The Thanksgiving coin toss loss game to the Lions.
Oh my god I remember that!
Jerome's facial expression is priceless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL team do you think is going to turn it around this season?
I think the Baltimore Ravens had a bad season, so they're going to make it back to the playoffs this year
Too bad Steve Smith won't be with them this time around
He retired at a good point in his career, and I agree that he deserves to have gotten a Superbowl ring
A lot of great players go without rings, like Larry Fitzgerald if the Cardinals don't win in the next season or two
They did pretty well a couple of seasons back, so what happened last season?
The Seahawks ruined their chances at the post season, only to lose to the Falcons in the playoffs
And the Cardinals lost to the Panthers the season before, didn't they?
Yep, there's something about NFC West teams losing to eventual Superbowl teams
But how awful was the Superbowl this year?
It was terrible, probably the worst Superbowl I've seen, if not the worst game overall
It would have been amazing if the Falcons had just stuck it through until the end
I'm not even a Falcons fan and I'm still reeling from that game
That's why I try not to get too invested in teams I don't follow regularly
What other teams do you think will turn it around?
The Browns picked up a lot of great players, so I think they're going to be set for the next few years
I'm always rooting for the Browns to turn it around, but I don't know if getting Myles Garrett will be enough right now
Maybe not, but they've built up a ton of draft picks for the next few years, so we could be looking at a resurgence
How great would it be to finally see the Browns in the playoffs?
It sure beats seeing the same two or three teams winning the AFC championship every year
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the best sport of all time?
probably football
really, you like soccer
no silly I mean good old american football
oh lol sorry I thought you mean football like kicking the white and black ball around
Nah that is great for people overseas but I like my good old fashioned full contact NFL
Yeah me too really love to watch the NY Giants
Oh no doubt Eli Manning is a great quarterback
Yes and the team is a good role model as a whole
yup the Bengals could learn a thing or two from the GIants
I know, did you see that Pac man Jones was arrested again?
Honestly?
Yeah I think either a DUI or fighting in public
Not sure why these millionaires have to still act like thugs
I guess you can take them out of the bad ends of town but still cannot get the thug out of them
I blame the coach
Yeah Marvin Lewis is a real pushover
Ha you can say that again
Marvin Lewis is a real pushover
I didn't mean that literally you dofus
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite team this year?
I always like the Redskins!
Why do you like them?
I don't want great-grandma rolling over in her grave!
That's not a bad reason, but what about the players?
My favorite player is Kerrigan.
What position does he play?
Linebacker.  He's really good.
Isn't he the one that signed a picture for you?
Yes.  It's hanging in my bedroom.
Do you think he'll start this season?
Absolutely.  Unless he gets hurt in training camp.
We don't want anyone getting hurt before the season starts.
Junior Galette got hurt last year.
What was his injury?
He had an achilles tendon tear.
Did he have to sit out?
He was out the whole season.
Do you think he will be back this season?i
I hope so!  He'll be at training camp.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea buddy!
I love the sport!
What's your favorite team?
Patriots
They're definitely the best!
Your favorite too?
Nah, but I can recognize talent when I see it
Fair enough!
What are you guys going to do when Brady retires?
I have no idea!
Scared?
Nah, we'll just get a clone of him 20 years younger!
Fingers crossed for cloning!
For sure, man!
How long do you think he'll play for?
At least a couple more seasons
Yea he's still looking good!
Very true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read the other day that Zach Orr might be coming out of retirement and coming back to the NFL.
He used to play for Baltimore Ravens, didn't he?
Yeah, he was a great linebacker.
Why did he retire? Wasn't he injured or something?
He retired in January because he had a spinal condition.
Did he have surgery or something that made it better?
He's had some new opinions from doctors that he might be okay to play.
Wouldn't a spinal problem seem permanent?
He had a condition he's had since birth, where one of his vertebrae never fully formed.
And the doctors told him he had to retire for something he's always had?
They told him at first he was more likely to have an injury.
Back problems can be scary. Even normal people can end up sidelined from work from them.
Well, he had a lot more doctors examine him, and they are saying he's not at any more risk than anyone else.
So he's thinking about coming back?
He said when he first announced he was retiring, if there was anyway he could return that he would.
He's still pretty young, isn't he?
He's only 24, so yeah he still had some years left to play.
I would be tempted to come back too.
At first they said he could be paralyzed or die. But now they said the main concern is not playing with herniated discs, and his have subsided.
I think all NFL players risk injury, it's part of the game. I could see how he would be tempted to come back if he could.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
You a fan of the nfl?
yep sure am.  You?
Yeah same here.
Who's your team?
I like the Bills.  you?
I like the Rams.
Did you like them before they moved to LA?
Not really.
Oh that's interesting.
I saw they were moving back to LA and wanted to give them a shot.
Rough first season out there.
Yeah I knew there were going to be some growing pains.
It's a shame they fired the head coach.
Yeah I like Jeff Fischer a lot.  Was too bad.
Who is the new coach?
I can't remember.
Well good luck this season.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Cowboys VS Rams opener.
What about it?
What are your thoughts on it?
Well, i think it's going to be a very uneventful game.
How so?
Well, nomo Romo for starters, the Rams arent that great so.....
So you think it's gonna be a non excitement game?
I think it will be so stereotypical that it will be tied at the end and whoever recieves the ball will win it.
So a coin toss will determine that game?
Pretty much.
Wow, that's hard to hear.
Sorry, but both teams need a serious reboot.
Any other teams in the same boat or worse off?
Well, Jacksonville always.
Yeah, they are gonna get clobbered in the Pre-Season opener.
No doubt.
Giants and Jets are gonna struggle Pre-Season too.
Giants?
Yeah, there not bringing the excitement.
I was thinking more like The Browns.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Mark did you hear that they will play an NFL game in Toronto again?!
Oh yes???
Yeah you remember the last game?
Yeah that was way back! In 2013 !
It was the Atlanta Falcons vs Buffalo Bills
yeah I know.. I'm such a fan of the Bills
But they are not doing so good any more.
Yeah the Bills need a major overhaul!
I'm glad they are coming to visit Toronto again
Do you think we will ever get an NFL team here?
I'm not sure we been talking about it for such a long time and I feel we really deserve a team
I know! I have been having to drive down to Buffalo to watch the games!
Wow that consumes a lot of gas!
Yeah, I do not think I will do it any more-- we would go shopping and watch the game also
So this game in Toronto is like a God send
Yes!
Lets keep wishing that we can get an NFL team
Yeah I will!
See you at the Bills game in Toronto
Ok See you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went to the game two weeks ago and the stadium was packed to the hilt
Who was playing?
The home team you know, the Patriots against the Steelers
Did you get a good parking space
Actually since we knew it would be crowded there, we took the bus
Good idea
You know the Patriots won though
Naturally, they are a pretty good team
Well I have seen the Patriots lose a few times
I was not wasn't saying they have never lost
Yeah because they lost last year
To whom ?
To the Bills  then the Seahawks
Yeah but that record was pretty impressive last year
Two losses
What could be better than that?
I don't know I guess you have a point. As I was saying the tickets sold out and the stadium was really packed
Did you all get good seats though?
Yes, though they were way up in the stands
Cool. Glad you all got through that okay
XXXXXXXXXXX
This upcoming NFL season should be awesome!
I can not wait to watch my Colts have a great year!
Do you have high expectations for them this year?
I sure do, I think Andrew Luck will really have a strong season.
He has all of the physical tools to be great, that is for sure.
The bad thing for him has been the lack of consistency among the offensive line.
Yea, this year may be the best line that he has played behind in his career.
I am excited about Le'Raven Clark at right tackle. He seems to be a good one.
He is young still, but he certainly showed potential last year.
Yea, hopefully our line can at least stay together and avoid serious injuries this year.
Playing behind a bad offensive line will make even the best quarterbacks look bad.
That is true, I feel that it is the most important unit that there is in football.
I agree with you on that one. The offensive line is crucial for any team to be successful.
What team are you most excited to see this upcoming season?
I have always been a big fan of the Green Bay Packers. So I can not wait to see what they will do this year.
Arron Rodgers may be the best quarterback in the entire league.
I sure think that he is, we are so close to being a great team that it drives me crazy!
What do you think is missing?
I really wished we could improve on the defensive side of the ball a little to be honest with you.
That would probably do it because the offense is in control for years to come with Rodgers running the show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready to watch my Giants dominate this year?
No way! The Eagles are definitely going all the way this year!
You say that every year! Last year you didn't even make the playoffs!
That was then, this is now. We have Alshon Jeffrey, Torrey Smith, and LeGarrette Blount. You're going to see a brand new offense this year.
But we have Odell Beckam Jr, Sherling Shepard, and we just got Brandon Marshall. You can't compete with that.
Okay, if you're so confident let's see you put your money where your mouth is.
I should be asking you that question. I'm always confident in my team.
Okay, so let's bet. $100 says the Eagles will make it further than your Giants.
Okay, you have yourself a deal. Be ready to pay up!
No way man, you're the one that's going to have to pay up.
Okay. We'll see what happens.
Trust me, it's going to happen. And we're definitely dominating the Cowboys this year too.
We beat the Cowboys twice last year, I'm not worried about them.
That last one was a close game, I wouldn't get so cocky if I were you.
I'm not being cocky, just being confident. Dez Bryant had a great year, there's no denying that. But he's still a rookie and has a lot to learn.
I can agree with that, he definitely has a lot to learn.
I'm interested to see how he performs this year, but like I said I'm confident in my team.
So am I! I can feel it, this is going to be the year for my Eagles.
You really do live in a fantasy world.
We'll see about that come September.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how do you think the Pats will be this year?
Outstanding.  Already were the best team in the NFL and just got better.
Yeah, they are the gold standard in all of American Sports.
Yes, year after year they just win and win.
I know, Brady old as he is, still the best.
Plus don't forget Jimmy G is pretty lights out himself.
Yeah, watching him play last year was awesome.
I know, it wasn't game managing either.  He made big time NFL throws.
He also shredded some good defenses.
Yeah, people overlook Miami is a good team.
They are.  Too bad he got hurt.
Yeah, if Brady still looks good Jimmy could have good trade value.
Or as much as I hate to say it so does Brady.  Could be like a Montana to KC thing.
Yeah, I don't know what San Fran got for that though.
Neither do I.  But I do know Steve Young turned out pretty good.
He sure did.  One of the only lefties to be lights out.
Yeah, most lefties struggle.  But if you can find a good one it poses problems for the defense.
So you think the Pats will repeat?
I think they certainly can.  It's just a matter of doing it.
I know what you're saying.  To many x-factors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Marshawn Lynch is back, though!
Yeah, and so is Tom Brady.
How many Super Bowls you think the Pats are gonna take?
Most likely 10 or more, depending on Brady's health and performance.
But what about that incident with the deflated footballs?
Well, that was over a long time ago, so that ain't gonna slide this time.
Yeah, you're right.
I think the Giants can win another one, though.
Of course they can!
Eli Manning's a reliable QB.
He's one of the best out there!
Of course, he is!
Well, who else is better than him?
His brother, Brady, Kapernick.
Oh, him.
He's pretty good, right?
Yes, indeed.
Oh yeah!
Now what?
Now we wait for the Browns vs Chiefs game to begin!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name some greats?
Sure! I'll start, John Elway.
Nice, he got them to the Super Bowl.
Yes, your turn.
Well, Dan Marino.... always a good choice.
True, i'll counter with Joe Namath.
HA! Broadway Joe! Good one.
Thought you would like that.
I'll pick Howie Long.
Oh well, if we are going there, Terry Bradshaw.
Geez, fine Michael Strathain.
Is he a legend?
Probably not, i'll retract that.
Mike Alstott... the A Train.
Good one. Here's my next pick, Johnny Unitas.
Wow, he IS a legend.
True, here's one for you, Ken "the Snake" Stabler.
RIGHT ON! Good pick.
Joe Montana, he's a legend.
Very good pick, definately a legend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Bill, you watch the game last night? The 49ers performed like a high school junior varsity team compared to the Cowboys.
Hey James, the 49ers were not doing so well I agree, without Colin Kaepernick the team seems to be really suffering
Bill you are being ridiculous, Colin Kaepernick and his political protest have nothing to do with the success or failure of the 49ers. The team is altogether busted.
James you are too much, how can you deny the fact that the recent political protest turmoil did not effect the teams overall moral?
Bill I believe the Cowboys are a strong model of good sportsmanship and talent.
James do you think the Cowboys will make it to the superbowl next season?
Bill if the Cowboys make it to the superbowl its because their defensive and offensive strategies are being refined through their preseason practicing techniques
Yeah James I heard that the Cowboys practice year round and that they travel to many different stadiums to get a sense of how each field is unique and must be mastered according to the terrain, weather, and stadium setup.
Bill that is very interesting information, I did not know the Cowboy's team leadership is studying environmental impact on performance
Yes James, did you also know that the Cowboys use extensive statistics and data collection on player movements to optimize individual player and collective team performance
Wow what kind of statistics are they performing Bill to understand player performance?
Well James, I heard they look at a variety of statistical indicators including number of fumbles, time of possession, yards rushed, number of concussions, number of contacts with opposing team players, and much more
Wow that is fascinating that the Cowboys and the NFL are utilizing big data to study player behavior and improve their performance
Yes these techniques were learned from Sabremetrics in baseball. The movie Moneyball wit Brad Pitt does a great job illustrating the power of data to optimize team configurations and strategies. These same principles are being applied to the NFL
Speaking of collect player data, have you seen the movie Concussion with Will Smith?
Yes that is an excellent movie that presents the effects of head injury on football player performance, health outcomes, mental health outcomes, criminal behavior, and mortality rates.
Yes I was shocked to see in that movie that some of the players who have history of repeatedly being tackled and sustaining head injuries beginning to abuse drugs and engaging in self-harmful behaviors
Yes it is true the movie Concussion is a well crafted non-fictional account of the development of the diagnosis for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy due to amyloid plaques building up in the brain after concussion. The plaques cause significant neural cell death which causes a decline in cognitive function, memory, judgement, and decision making in NFL football players
The movie does an interesting job of highlighting the role of the NFL in trying to censor and ignore the problems of head injury in football.
I believe the NFL is a great business, but sometimes its bottom-line priorities may interfere and conflict with protecting the health of the players. More research and treatment must be provided to NFL football players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you know that football season starts soon?
Yeah I cannot wait for the NFL Draft
I know i'm hoping my team picks up some good players
oh yeah who is your team?
The Cincinnati Bengals, and yours?
Same I'm a huge Bengals fan
Awesome I knew that there was a reason we got along so well
So what position do you think we need the most help in the draft for?
I would say Quarterback but i'll give Dalton another chance
I think we need another wide receiver
Defintely AJ Green needs some help
agreed he doesn't get a lot of throws because he has no help on the other side of the field
Yes being double teamed every game makes it tough for sure
I also think Marvin Lewis needs to be let go
for sure, he is mediocre at best
Mike Brown should probably get rid of him this year
He wont though because Marvin works cheap
yup half what other coaches get
guess we will have another mediocre team
sadly yes I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do yo remember some of the all time NFL greats?
Oh yea, I remember all of the old Dallas Cowboys of the 1990's.
Those teams from the 90's era NFL were great.
The player I miss watching the most was Troy Aikman.
Yea, Troy was great he had so much heart and he put so much of himself into those teams he was awesome.
I think he was a real field general back then.
I also like the cowboys offensive line, remember Larry Allen?
Yea, Larry Allen was also a beast he was a new breed.
All these linemen now owe him a thanks he changed the game.
He sure did and he was a game changer in a big way.
I hope the cowboys make a push this season.
I think they will, Dak is an amazing QB it's going to be awesome.
Dak is good and so is Zeke Elliot, those two are going to change the league for awhile.
I agree I have my hopes on them this season.
I like the Patriots but they win enough.
I do to but they have to pass the torch at some point.
I felt bad for the falcons in that superbowl but wow.
Yea Tom Brady wanted it more for sure.
Who is winning it all this year?
I would say the Dallas Cowboys, they are due for a big year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready to watch the Dolphins lose again this year.
Hey, my Dolphins are still the only team to go undefeated for an entire season and win the Super Bowl.
That was way back in 1972, they haven't even been to the Super Bowl since 1985.
They lost it in 1985 and also in 1983, but at least they made it.
I guess they were a good team back then, but they have been struggling ever since.
Dan Marino was a great quarterback, but he never got them to the Super Bowl.
I think the real reason they were undefeated back in '72 was because of Shula.
Yes, Don Shula may have been the greatest coach ever.
I think Bob Griese was the quarterback the year they were undefeated.
He was, but he broke his ankle in week 5 an was out for most of the season after that.
I didn't know that, who replaced him?
It was Earl Morrall that helped them to remain undefeated for the season.
Well hopefully Miami will one day be as great a team as they were back then.
I hope they will within the next few years.
It must be hard watching them struggle to even make the playoffs every year.
They have to get good enough to beat the Patriots, or they will never make it to a Super Bowl.
The Patriots are a hard team to beat.
I will still be rooting for the Dolphins every year, even if they can't seem to make it to the final game.
I understand team loyalty, I wish the best for you.
This is going to be the year that Miami finally makes it to the Super Bowl again, and wins it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so upset with the transgressions of last years Superbowl.
You are still thinking about that B?
It's been eating me up for months, it was just so unreal that the Falcons lost on such a big lead.
On the bright side the Falcons are the younger squad with a legacy to protect, they will be back.
I agree with you, Devonta Freeeman is still my favorite player right now.
He was incredible for my fantasy league all year too!
He really covered good yards and made solid catches throughout the year for Atlanta.
Falcons have always had a great run squad, and always a great quarterback the land those kill shots.
Someone told me that Matt Ryan just might be the greatest of all time!
That is absolute tomfoolery man, how can he be the best when he gave up a lead like that?
He gave up a lead to a better team, but against Brady his stats and skills match up well.
If we are talking stats we can go far back, my dad still thinks Joe Montana is the best.
Well the game has evolved, and arms nowadays are incomparable.
I completely agree, and Matt Ryan is no chump my man.
He was one of the most entertaining quarterbacks of last year.
He can get those completions, but I was really a Cowboys fan last season.
With Dak Prescott things were looking incredible early in the season.
Yeah but he was a bit young and took on too much.
Maybe it was all thrown at him a bit early but he will surely come back better!
I agree bro, we gotta catch a Cowboy's game some time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved Superbowl 49.
I bet you did.  You're from Boston, right?
Yes.  A great victory.
Brady didn't do that well, with two interceptions.
They were down by ten points in the fourth quarter.
It looked pretty scary.
I felt better when they scored a touchdown to be only three down.
Then they got the ball back.
A quick pass to Edelman and they had a four point lead.
But still some time on the clock.
Yes, with a Russell Wilson getting hot.
I just cannot believe Kearse's catch.
I thought the ball had fallen to the ground.
It did not look good for the Pats.
Everyone was thinking Marshawn Lynch would punch it in.
The beast mode.
But then, the miracle.
The Malcolm Butler interception.
I loved the look on Richard Sherman's face.
He shook Brady's hand as a measure of good sportsmanship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was one of your favorite NFL teams?
Do you mean franchise or a certain year of a team?
How about a certain year of a team.
The 1999 St. Louis Rams were one of my favorite teams.
Who was on that team?
They had Kurt Warner as quarterback.
Who was the running back?
It was Marshall Faulk.
Those are two hall of fame players.
They also had Tory Hold and Issac Bruce.
That's a really good offense.
It was called the greatest show on turf.
Why the greatest show on turf?
Because they played in a dome on astro turf.
That's pretty funny.
They were a fun team to watch.
Why were they so fun to watch?
They would score all the time.  That offense was dominate.
Who did they play to win the Super Bowl.
The Tennessee Titans.  It was a close game the Titans lost by 1 yard on the final play.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, when does the football season start?
I think it starts September 10th.
Awesome. Who are you excited to watch?
I'm most excited to watch the Patriots. What about you?
I'm most excited to see how the Cowboys play.
The Cowboys were great last year. Think they can keep it up?
I do think they can do it again. Do you think the Patriots will make it back to the superbowl?
I'm not sure. It would be awesome to see Tom Brady win another ring.
I think Dak Prescott may challenge him this year.
He did play great last year. But we will see if he can keep playing at that caliber.
I think he is an excellent QB and the Cowboys got lucky drafting him.
Yeah. Its not often a new QB can come and play that well in the NFL.
Yeah. I'm positive he will do it again this year and they will make the playoffs.
Wouldn't it be cool if the Patriots played the Cowboys in the superbowl?
That would be fantastic. Think it could happen.
I think the Patriots have a good chance of returning but can the Cowboys win a playoff game?
They are bound to win some with this team. Its only a matter of time.
I will wait and see. But I think this will be an amazing season.
Same here. Can't wait to watch.
Me too. September cant come soon enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You stoked to see how the Cowboys will do this year without Romo?
Yeah, I think Prescott will be an amazing addition.
Hopefully he doesn't choke like Romo.
Yeah, he had a knack for that. I mean when he was on, he was on, but he would kill it so fast you didn't realize what the hell happened.
Think they have a chance at the superbowl?
For sure, with a new quarterback, and the defense line from last year I definitely see them having a shot. I'd really like to see the Cowboys and Panthers in a superbowl this year.
Yeah, frankly I'm just tired of seeing the Patriots get in, in spite of all the cheating scandals. I love Cam Newton so I'd love to see the Panthers get in there.
Yeah, I think it's time for Tom Cheating Brady to hang it up. How many balls can you deflate before you find a different career?!
Right?! I think Cam Newton deserves a superbowl win, even though Dallas is my number one team.
He does for sure. If the Panthers could ever get past the crappy ref calls.
I know it's ridiculous. I've watched too many Panthers games won by the refs, not the other team.
It seems like as much gripe as people make about it the NFL would have a better system to ensure fair games.
Well it looks like the Patriots are "set to win" the super bowl again this year, per predictions right now.
With the refs on their team and deflated balls, why not!?
Well, the cowboys are predicted second in line, so maybe they can blow those predictions to pieces this year. Not really lining up great for the Panthers though.
Yeah, I saw that Cowboys were number 2, and Panthers didn't even make the top 10!
Well we know stats are everything, just look at the Panthers having an almost perfect season, then blowing it at the Superbowl. Maybe the Boys will pull through this year.
They seem to have a better chance than my poor cardiac cats.
Haha! True. Well maybe we can make a gentleman's bet on the cheatriots and the cowboys this year.
You're on! Lets make a Superbowl pool at work and win some money!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a football fan?
Are you talking about NFL or soccer?
NFL not soccer.
Not really but I have watched a few Falcons games in my past.
The Falcons new schedule is out for 2017 and their first game is August 10 in Florida.
Is it on TV?
Yes they are all televised.
Do all NFL teams get all their games televised?
I don't think so.
Then how do they figure it out?
Well that first game I mentioned for the Falcons was one of 4 preseason games. They are all televised.
How many regular season games are there?
Their schedule says 12 games and 1 bye. All of them on are on TV.
I guess it depends on what their ranking is going into this season  to who gets  televised maybe?
No it usually  gets played on local networks but sometimes it depends on the large net work if they are going to play it.
Sounds too confusing to me.
Whatever is going to make the most amount of money for the large network is probably the way it works for the most part.
oh yes it's all about the money and not for the love of the game.
I am glad i am not a football fan because it always made me mad when a game wasn't televised.
I can see how that would be very annoying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
HI! Are you ready for the NFL football season to start?
I'm ready. How about you?
I'm ready as well. Will you go to the Cardinals team practices before the season starts?
Yes. Those are open to the public, right?
Yes. I'm not sure where the open practices will be this year.
They'll be at University of Phoenix Stadium like last year.
Oh! I didn't go to them last year.
You probably thought the San Diego Chargers would stay in San Diego.
Should I go to the Chargers practices in Los Angeles?
No. I've heard the actual Chargers games will be held in a soccer stadium.
Do you plan to get season tickets for the Chargers games?
I've heard Chargers season tickets are already sold out.
Will the Chargers play the Cardinals this year?
No, I checked the schedule. The Chargers will not play the Cardinals, but the Los Angeles Rams will.
I'd hoped to see Philip Rivers and Antonio Gates.
You'll have to see them when the NFL games are broadcast.
Will you keep your Chargers jerseys?
I think I burned the number 17 jersey, which is River's, at the protest.
I may have to pick a new favorite NFL team.
I've heard the New England Patriots or Cleveland Browns are available.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best team name in the NFL?
Titans
I like that name too
It is better than the Oilers
Who are they?
They were the Tennessee team before the Titans.
Titans is a much better name
I agree
Did they do good last year?
They went 9 and 7
That is a decent record
They tied the first place team
Who was in first?
The Texans
They are from Houston right?
Yes
Do you think the Titans will win the Super Bowl next year?
No
I think they can win the division though
Me too, but there are better teams that will defeat them in the postseason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think are the best quarterbacks of all time?
Easy, Tom Brady is number one.
What? No way, you're crazy.
Who is better than Tom Brady?
Tom is greay, but Peyton Manning crushes him.
Oh yea, I forgot about Peyton.
How can you forget about Peyton? He's not the only one better than Tom Brady either.
Who else is better?
Brett Favre is better.
No way, not even close.
What are you talking about? Favre has like 72,000 yards completed.
How many does Tom Brady have?
Maybe 60,000.
Oh wow, that's a big difference.
It's a huge difference.
What about Eli Manning?
Tom is better than Eli.
Ok good.
Yea Eli has like 50,000.
That's still amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The patriots?
They're my favorite team.
Why?
Tom Brady and the patriots are just the best team for the past ten years.
That's interesting.
How many superbowls did Brady win?
I can't remember exactly but three or more.
I think it was a little more.
That's an incredible amount.
Do you think they can win more.
I think so but what do you think.
I think Brady will win two more.
Do you think anyone can stop them?
The broncos.
Why?
Peyton Manning has a lot to prove.
Do you think he can still bring it?
I do.
He is intense isn't he.
Yes he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the Dallas Cowboys this season?
I dont know, Tony Romo wont be playing.
Oh that doesnt matter, Dak Prescott will be great!
Yea but can he lead his team?
Of course he can, didnt you see last season? He was great.
Yea but that was only 1 year, he might have a softmore slump?
No way he is a born leader.
How do you know?
Look at his college experience, he was great.
He also had a great running back in Ezekiel Elliot
Yes Elliot is awesome, he will be great again
Of course, thats if he stays out of trouble
Yea thats true
How is their defence this year?
I think its gonna be better than last year?
No way, they lost so many cornerbacks to free agency
Yea but they will just replace them
That does not give me confidence
You might be right about that
Well their offence will probably make up for it
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey, football season's about to start
yeah, i'm really looking forward to this season
my kansas city chiefs are going to beat your raiders for sure
are you kidding me?! our quarterback, derek carr isn't going to let that happen
i still can't believe his the brother of david carr.
yeah, me too, david was never as good as derek
wasn't david chosen number 1 in the draft a long time ago?
yeah, it was back in 2002.
who selected him again?
the houston texans, the where a new team in the nfl, they messed up big time
i know, he had a lot of potential too. i was routing for david
well, i'm just happy that his brother is a much better quarterback, that sounds harsh but its true
either way, you cant beat my chiefs and then they will win the super bowl!
in your dreams, the chiefs always lose in the playoffs. they cant ever get passed the first week of the playoffs.
yeah its sad i know, but this time's is going to be different just you watch
you always say that and they always lose at the end
i can say the same for your raiders
no way, we are the oakland raiders!
aren't they moving to las vegas?
don't remind me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the Raiders situation this year?
In terms of the game, or their off the field issues?
I was looking at more of the off-the-field issues, but interesting to know what they will do on the field as well.
I believe they are still in Oakland again this year and are moving to Las Vegas the year after.
Is that a sure thing? The Las Vegas move?
I think so, last time I checked. Who knows, though, things could have changed.
Kind of sad to see them leave Oakland again.
Yes, that would be the second time they left. I bet the fans will be furious.
Their fans are furious and passionate to begin with. Wonder how they would handle this?
Probably with riots on the streets and inside the stadium.
Wouldn't surprise me. How do you think they'll do on the field.
They are still either the second or third best team in the AFC with Derek Carr back.
I could see that. They definitely have a good balance on offense and defense.
It was a shame that Carr got hurt last year. They had a chance to beat New England, I believe.
Would have been a good matchup. They probably would have given New England a better game than the Steelers did.
Anybody could have. Steelers went into New England and things went south quickly.
Wonder what would happen if they won the Super Bowl this year and then moved out.
Difficult to tell. Wonder if the fans would be more behaved and send them off on a good farewell or even be more infuriated.
I would guess infuriated. Those Raiders fans are crazy.
They are definitely the craziest in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
HEy what do you think about the San Diego Chargers this year?
I don't think anything about the San Diego Chargers.
What do you mean?
The Charger franchise moved to L.A. The Raiders are moving too.
The Raiders are moving? To where?
They're gonna be going to Las Vegas.
That's too bad. Marshawn Lynch just signed that contract with them, and he loves Oakland.
Yeah, but he'll be long gone before they actually move.
Why is that?
Well they won't be moving for a few years I guess.
Oh ok. What was the name of the running back they had before Marshawn.
Latavius Murray.  He was pretty good, I don't know why they didn't just keep him.
Yeah he was solid, I think he ended up going to the Vikings.
Sure did, then Adrian Peterson had to figure out somewhere to go.
Yeah it's funny how these kinds of carousels just happen.
I think ADrian was done anyway.  He looked way past his prime last year.
Yeah he looked slow. Still good, but slow.
I don't think these guys know when to call it quits, they think they'll be good forever.
Yeah like Brett Favre.
Yeah, I still hear his name come up sometimes with interest of playing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Rob Gronkowski?
Yes he is amazing.
How do you think he did in the Superbowl.
He is a complete player, he blocked really well.
Yes he does all the little things well.
Yes I couldn't agree more.
The Patriots are a fine example of a dynasty.
Yes they are amazing.
I can't say enough about Gronk though.
What do you like about it.
I like how he is one of the best tight ends to play the game.
Yes he can do it all.
He can run and catch like a wide receiver.
Yet he is big, tall, fast, and strong.
Yes he is the prototype for greatness.
The Patriots are so strong, they will probably win it next year also.
Yes I agree.
They are fun to watch too.
Yes they put it together so well and impart wisdom with their performance.
Yes I completely agree, they are great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe football is almost back!
Yeah, training camp starts soon, right?
In a couple weeks, I think.
That means fantasy football is coming back soon, too.
Yeah!  We'll have to schedule our draft.
I'd take TB12 first, personally.
Do you think the Patriots will repeat this year?
Definitely!  Brady is the greatest of all time.
Well, he is almost 40.
Must be all of that avocado ice cream.
Their secondary is going to be insane, too.
Malcolm Butler and Stephon Gilmore together sounds pretty intimidating.
I wonder what the Patriots are going to do about Jimmy Garoppolo.
It's gotta be tough to be backup to Brady.
Yeah, you just have to hope for an injury to the greatest quarterback ever.
Yeah, that seems weird.
The organization seems to like Garappolo a lot, though.
They should trade him and cash in now.
Then who will replace Brady when he retires?
Can anyone replace Brady?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?
I don't know, they were really good last year though.
They were!  I think they will finally make it to the Super Bowl again.
Really?  You sure are optimistic?
Why shouldn't I be?  Their core players are coming back, and they had a really good draft.
That's true, but I think their defense is lacking some.
Maybe, but their offense makes up for that.
Their offense is really potent.  Do you think Dak will have another good year?
I'm hoping so.  He had such a good rookie year.
He did, and so did Zeke!
I can't wait to see him with a year of experience.  He  is going to have a monster year!
I think so too.  What do you think their weakest position is?
I would have to say defensive line, but there is hope for them there too.
Interesting.  I don't see much hope there.
Well, they have some good positional players, and will have a good rotation.
That's an interesting perspective.
With some luck, they will stay injury free and do what needs to be done.
That's the key to most any team...stay injury free.
I agree.  I am so looking forward to the season.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the NFL to start!
Yep. Been too long without football.
The Patriots are going to go back to back!!
Nah, I think the Cowboys will take it all this year. The Cheatriots don't stand a chance.
Yeah, well, the Cowboys let their best corners walk.
No, the Cowboys let veterans walk, but they aren't the best. Everyone is really high on this new group and they look really good.
Yeah, maybe, but there's no pass rusher.
Between Taco Charlton and Charles Tapper, there's plenty of talent there. We'll see what hapoens and how they gel in training camp.
Well, I don't think they're that great. The rest of the NFC East has stepped up.
The rest of the NFC East has miles to go. This offense is potent and with Prescott and Elliott returning to form, they'll win it.
Who do you like in the AFC?
I think it's the Chiefs. They have a complete team, and Andy Reid is a fantastic coach.
Did't they draft a quarterback this year?
Yep. Patrick Mahomes from Texas Tech. I'm excited to see how he does.
He does have a good coach to learn from.
Yeah, and Alex Smith is better than people give him credit for. Mahomes will get his due.
What about the Texans?
The Texans won't go anywhere without a QB. Right now, their best bet is to see who gets cut in training camp....and pray.
Sounds like the Broncos.
Yep. They messed up with Osweiller. No QB. Hey, I have to go. Talk to you later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think had the best draft in the NFL?
I personally think the San Francisco 49ers had one of the best drafts.
I can see your point.  The trade they made with the Chicago Bears was amazing for them.
Yeah, that trade definitely helped their overall draft.  I was surprised to see Reuben Foster fall so far in the first round.
Agreed, wasn't he projected as a high first round pick?
Yeah, all the experts during the pre-draft process projected him to be a top 10 pick.
Do you know why he fell so far?
From reading various articles which speculated on his fall, it sounded like teams may have been concerned about his shoulder injury.
I see.  Well I personally really liked the LA Chargers draft, I'm really excited to see all their rookies play next year.
Yeah, I was a bit surprised by their pick of Mike Williams.
I really liked them picking up a couple of offensive linemen as well, I think that's really going to help them in the future and protect Phillip Rivers.
Yeah, hopefully that helps Rivers stay healthy and on his feet.  Who do you think is going to win the Superbowl this year?
I have to take the Patriots on that one.
Patriots for sure...they somehow won the Superbowl last year AND got better players in the offseason.
That was shocking!  I could not believe the Patriots somehow got Brandin Cooks AND kept Malcolm Butler.
That offense is going to be scary as long as Tom Brady remains healthy.
I hope so, but at some point age is going to catch up with Tom Brady.
How old is he now?
I think he's about 40, which is amazing.  I'm 40 and barely want to exercise.
Hopefully for Patriots fans, he's got a couple more years in him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When will the Dallas Cowboys get better?
I miss Troy Aikman.
Dave Compo was coach in 2002.
I liked when Tony Banks was quarterback.
Roy Williams was good in 2002.
Remember Walter Payton?
Then Bill Parcells was coach.
Who was quarter back in 2005?
I think it was Drew Bledsoe.
Remember Terrell Owens?
He got happy when he got a touch down.
In 2009 their practice field cover collapsed during a wind storm.
12 players were injured.
And some coaches also.
2010 Jason Garrett was interim head coach.
They have a blue star as the logo.
It represents THE LONE STAR STATE.
That would be Texas.
It is the best known logo.
Because they are the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who's your favorite football team?
Oh, I'm a huge fan of the Patriots.
Are you one of those recent Patriot fans or a life-long fan?
I've been a fan since I was a kid through the ups and downs of the 90's and all the Super Bowls.
I generally don't like patriots fans, especially the ones that have only been fans since they because a dynasty.
Yeah, I agree.  Bandwagon fans in any sport drive me nuts.
How are you still a fan even though you live in Texas?
I have the NFL package so I can see all the games and I read everything about the team online.
But why didn't you become a fan of one of the Texas teams?
How can I give up a life-long allegiance to my team just because I moved somewhere else.  That would be stupid!
Well, I think you should be a fan of the team local to where you live.
How can you be a true fan if you switch your allegiance just because you move somewhere else?
If you live in a particular place, you should support the local teams and organizations.
So, by that logic.  I loved the local seafood when I lived in New England but now I should just stop liking it and make BBQ my favorite food because I live in Texas.
I guess I get that.  I would be hard to just abandon all your heroes from growing up.
Yeah, I couldn't just decide that Brady, Grogan and John Hannah aren't my favorite players anymore.
Well as long as you have Brady, you'll probably still have the best team in the NFL.
Brady is the GOAT!!
Well, Montana might have something to say about that but you're probably right, I guess.
Go Pats!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL division?
I am partial to the AFC.
I am too.
It's really just because of the teams that I like.
Same here. Who do you think is going to be the best AFC team next season?
I'm not sure but I hope it's the Titans.
They very well could be. I thought they were the best team in the division last season.
I've felt that they have a really high skill ceiling for a couple years now.
I would agree with that. Their offensive line has been great.
They are great in the quarterback position, too.
Yeah, Marcus Mariota was underrated last year.
They've also had a great drafts both this year and last year.
It does seem like they're shaping up to be a powerhouse team.
They were averaging 30 points a game midseason last year.
Yeah, I remember them being explosive for awhile.
It would be crazy to see what that team could do with a top rated receiver.
Yeah, I feel they still have a couple roles to fill.
You never know, though. Sometimes people you wouldn't expect start performing at huge levels.
True, there have been some very surprising rookies that last few years.
Either way, I'm excited to start watching some AFC division football this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, do you watch the NFL?
Yes, what's up?
Who do you think is the worst team in the NFL?
Probably the Buffalo Bills.
Why do you think them?
They have no quarterback, and no defense.
The Bills defense was good, they finished above .500 last year!
Yeah, true, maybe the Browns then.
The Browns are never competitive, their quarterback draft pick was a bust too.
Who Johnny Manziel?
Yeah, he sucks, but Cody Kessler is way better and he isn't a bad guy.
Still, they have no superstars.
The Browns are probably the worst on a yearly basis.
I don't get it, what do they do with all of their draft picks?
They just don't assimilate and play as a team.
The Lions have been pretty bad since losing Calvin Johnson, and their quarterback is kind of weak too.
The Lions are decent, but not a great team.
Who else can you think of?
I think we have it settled, the Browns are the worst team in the NFL.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know anyone who played in the NFL?
Sadly no, you?
No, had a cousin who played ball in college but that's it.
Do you have a favorite NFL team?
That's a hard one I like a few of them but the Packers.
Are you a fan of Aaron Rodgers?
No I was a fan of Favre's so that has stuck with me all this time even after his retirement.
That makes sense.
How about you?
Mine has to be the Colts.
Even after Peyton left?
Yep, he was great and I loved him but not the reason I like the team.
Why do you still like them.
I like them because of the season the coach was diagnosed with cancer and the team fought against all odds to win games.
I remember that, that was inspiring.
Yes it was.
That's the best reason i've heard to like a team.
Against all odds they proved themselves.
I like them too.
That's great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready for the NFL season?
Yeah I'm getting pretty excited. Summer is so boring for sports
Yeah, The draft in April always gets me pumped for the season
Yeah! Training camp is going to start soon.
Are you planning on going to any teams' training camps?
No but I always follow each team's news
Yeah, me too.
Who you got this year in the super bowl?
I'm not sure. The Cowboys looked really good last year and then choked in the playoffs.
Yeah, I could see that happening again this year. I like the Raiders this year.
Yeah, Derek Carr is a beast.
Definitely. The Patriots are going to be contenders again this year.
I know! When do you think Tom Brady will retire?
Not sure. Probably never! That man is a machine.
I know. I think he'll definitely win one more super bowl before he retires
Yeah, for sure. He is the greatest of all time, by far.
Easily. Who do you think the next great quarterback will be?
I think Prescott or Carr. They are both looking very promising.
Yes, but the competition just isn't there. The golden age of quarterbacks seems to be over.
True. We will see what happens. No one can predict the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won the Superbowl last year again?
Oh gosh, I think the Falcons?
The Falcons? I'm asking about the 2016 game.
Yeah, Patriots versus Falcons, wasn't it?
I think the Patriots won that one.
Oh, well why did you ask then?
I don't know, I guess your wrong answer fueled my memory.
Ha ha, well if it was the Patriots like you said they are unstoppable.
Not really, I mean I'm sure they've lost before.
Of course they have, but they've won so much lately.
They have like 5 titles, don't they?
Something like that, I know other teams have more though.
I know for certain the Packers have won the most titles.
Since the NFL was created?
Yep, they've won 13.
And how do you know that exactly?
My family are huge Packers fans and bring it up every season.
Ha ha, well good on your family and the Packers.
I don't think they've won in a while though.
Probably not, but I'm sure they will again soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So when was THE first national combine, I wonder.
1982 is when BLESTO and National held a joint combine for the entire league.
That's kinda fun story.
yep. History is always interesting. Oh and then ESPN started televising the draft
In 1980. And in 1984, Mel Kiper started doign the analysis of the draft.
That's the best part, because it lets s know who's coming in, what value they bring, etc
Yep. All important imformation to have about your hometown team or your favorite team.
They even started televising the college picks.
That's just going to far if you ask me. They're just kids, barely 18 and talking about which college they will be playing for. That's silly.
Well, they form the base of the NFL draft picks in 4 years. It's pretty important
Maybe.
You know what irks me?
What's that?
Swapping drafts.
What's wrong with that?
Well it's misleading for one. And if you get a no 1 pick and get a star QB, you should stick with it, and improve the team
Oh yeah, that reminds me, that Eli Manning thing
Yeah, Manning told Chargers he didn't want to play for the Chargers flat out
But they picked him anyway only to swap with Giants for Rivers.
Well Chargers got more than just Rivers, they also got Nate Kaeding, Shawne Merriman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.  You excited about the upcoming season?  What's your team?
You betcha I am.  Packers all the way!  I can't wait....
Actually, I was talking to that gentleman over there.  But since you butted in like a typical Packer fan, I guess I'll talk to you.
Better off anyway.  No sense talking about anything other than the Pack.  Goin all the way!!!!
Typical response.  How's the weather been around your place?
It's great weather for a game.  I can't wait for the Green and Gold to beat down the opposition this year and bring the trophy back to Title Town where it should really permanently sit.
I see you've brought it back to the Packers.  So you are confident this year?
Of course.  Nelson is the best receiver in the league; Rodgers is the best QB; the defense will be much better because we have more inexperienced rookies in the secondary; and we have a brand new running back that hasn't yet been physically broken down by a full season of games.
And the best always rise to the top, don't they?
Heck yes.  That's why they always make the playoffs.
But don't necessarily win.  Did they rise to the top against the Falcons last year?
That was only because of the bad call against the fullback when he supposedly fumbled!
What about that Seahawk game?  Did they rise to the top when they were up by 9 with 4 minutes left?
That's not fair!  They were ripped off.  There were so many penalties that weren't called!
Didn't they lead the league in scoring in 2011 but got stuffed by the Giants?  And if I recall, the refs were looking for ways to get the Packers back into the game.
The Giants stole all of our signals!  They cheated.
Nope, that was the Giants vs. Vikings.  Nice try though.  What about when Favre threw that late interception to the Giants?
I don't talk about him.  He's a traitor.
So you still think that they're destined to win?
After they've been hosed so many times, how can I not?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your opinion on the Dallas Cowboy?
Ehh, I like them, though there are some people who just hate their guts.
Yeah, I don't understand why.
It's probably because of the stigma of them being arrogant and such.
I don't really see that in them, though.
Me neither. Seem to me they are very genuine and great players.
I love Tony Romo, it's really unfortunate that he's plagued with injury.
Yeah I feel really bad when he was injured in preseason.
But hey, if he wasn't injured, we wouldn't have never found Dak Prescott.
Yes! He was so good!
I love watching him play, such great arm.
And his running back too. Ezekiel is very explosive.
I just wish we had a better defense.
Well, we do though. We drafted a lot for our defense. After this year, I think we can be very good on both side of the fields.
Let hope so. I wish we can have JJ Watt on our team though.
Oh yes, I love watching him play. Such great plays and concentration.
Too bad, he's a player for our rivalry.
Haha but the Texans are not really good, let hope he'll switch teams
I hope so, too.
All this football talk makes me want the season to come already.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
American or European?
American
Dude I have season tickets!
No way!!
Yea man!
For which team?
Bills!
Aw man you're so lucky!
Yea I saved up for them!
Going to the home opener?
Nah, I have a vacation on the same date
That's a bummer
Yea you're telling me!
I'm looking to sell them if you know anyone.
You're looking at him!
Oh?  How much would you pay?
For those?  100 each?
Deal!
Awesome man.  I'll get them to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football? Training camp is only a month or so away.
Oh man, I'm still in baseball mode, but now that you mention it...
Next season should be pretty interesting. I still can't believe the Patriots managed to come back in the Super Bowl.
Yeah, as a Patriots hater I was shocked. There are so many things that had to happen for New England to come back.
That's their magic though, everything broke right at the end and they took advantage.
Who else do you think will be a contender this year?
I want to say the Cowboys because they caught fire last year. You never know though with young QBs.
Yeah, Prescott could take another step forward, or sometimes those guys have sophomore slumps.
I can tell you who won't be contending this year: the 49ers. I've grown up with 49ers fans, so it's kind of funny with the team being so bad.
The 49ers fans I know are pretty resigned to another bad season. How about those Raiders though?
Yeah, they were good for the first time in 15 years. Assuming Derek Carr is healthy this year, they should improve. Khalil Mack is a monster on defense.
I'm hoping they can do something memorable before moving to Las Vegas. The Oakland fans deserve it.
The Chiefs should be good again too. They're just so balanced between offense and defense.
That's a division I'm excited to watch next year. Any players you're looking out for?
Besides the usuals, I think Leonard Fournette could be a great rookie. He's on the Jaguars, so might not get blocking though.
He seems built to be a stud in the NFL. How about Christian McCaffrey?
Yeah, it's weird, you don't see 2 running backs drafted so high very often. I think McCaffrey is maybe too slight to be an every down back, but the Panthers should be able to get him the ball where he needs it.
He's so fast. Just get him the ball in the flat and let him work his magic.
On the lighter side, the Cowboys drafted a guy named Taco.
He should be a fan favorite, I already want that jersey.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how do you think the Green Bay Packers will do this year?
They did lose Eddie Lacey, but I think the rookie will fill in his shoes nicely,  I like them to get back to the Super Bowl.
You sound very confident about that. What makes you think so?
I think Aaron Rodgers will want to put another ring on his finger before he calls is quits.
Aaron Rodgers still has a lot of years left. Why do you think this is his year?
I like the additions they've made to the offense, especially Martellus Bennett from the Patriots
Yeah, they really need a playmaker at that position, I'm with you on that one.
I also really like the rookie running back they picked up in the draft
We need to have to have a good running back to make the passing game work.
Yes!  We have so many good receivers and if we can have any success in the running game, watch out!
What else?
I also think Aaron Rodgers is so good.  He gets frustrated not being in the big game.  He really should have been there more than once.
I know.  I felt bad for him the year he played injured for the whole playoffs only to be let down
I remember it like yesterday!  Up by 15 points with less than five minutes to play in the 4th quarter.  How do you lose that game?
Everything that could have gone wrong did.  A botched onside kick, a blown coverage 50 yards downfield.  It makes me sick!
Me too!  Forget I brought it up.  This year we will make up for it and get back to the Super Bowl.
I am with you.  Do you have tickets to any of the games this year?
I can buy some from my friend who has season tickest, but they're expensive this year.  over $100 a seat I think.
I will pitch in and we should go to at least one game this year!
Sounds great.  I will talk to my friend and see what games I can get!  Talk to you later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, which team do you think will be the biggest surprise of the season in the NFL?
I think the Browns have a decent chance this year.
They'er always so bad!!!
I know, but this year might be the year they get things together.
How are they going to pull it off?
Well, hopefully their off season acquisitions and new signings will help.
I think it will take much more than that, though.
I agree, their coaching staff will have to put in a lot of work.
Well, they do have some talent, but probably not enough.
I agree that it might be another building year, but they have some pieces to work with.
I can understand that, hopefully injuries will not be a problem.
All NFL teams have to deal with injuries, unfortunately.
Yes, and luck plays a pretty big factor in team success.
I agree, but given a clean slate of health - the Browns may surprise some people.
Well then I will be on the lookout for them then!
You heard it hear first!
I personally think that the Jets have a shot to make a splash.
Yes, they did shake up their coaching staff within the last couple years.
It will be another year of building on what they are now establishing.
This year - we may see many surprises in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Oakland Raiders be any good next season?
It depends on how Derek Carr plays next year.
He had a great season.
Yeah he seems to get better every year.
He kept his number of interceptions very low this season.
That is a good stat to focus on.
It can win you games if you limit interceptions.
Exactly especially if your team causes the other team to turnover a lot.
In that scenario it is almost a guaranteed win.
Do you think Derek will win a Superbowl before his career is over?
I sure hope he does.
I know he really deserves it.
A lot of players deserve it but not all of them always reach that milestone.
Yeah then meanwhile some players reach it five times or more in their career.
It really is all luck and chemistry.
I agree if a lucky talented team has good chemistry they have an amazing chance at winning the Superbowl.
Unless there is a good enough team to overpower any of the luck.
I am so curious how next season will play out.
Yeah I'll definitely be wanting to see how Derek Carr plays.
Same here we can watch together!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What excites you this year in the NFL?
I am excited about the Cowboys.
Me too
They have a great shot this year
I like their offense.
Their defense is good too.
Do you like Romo?
Yes, but I am not sure if he can bounce back this year
It will be interesting to see what they do.
I agree
So, are they your pick?
No
Who do you like in the NFC?
The Packers
They are good
Yeah I think this is their year.
Green Bay always puts out a good team
They really do
So who will the Packers play in the Super Bowl?
I think they'll play the Steelers
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Eagles are going to be so good this year.
Eh, not sure I'm buying that.
How about I school you as to why I feel that way?
Please, by all means.
Well first of, Wentz is going to dominate.
Anything will be better than last year.
He was good last year!
Good?  Don't make me laugh.
He did great for a rookie.
He dinked and dunked the whole year.  Didn't throw a pass more than ten yards.
They kept the offense vanilla for him to make it easier.
Exactly.  I thought he was supposed to be cerebral and smart.
He is, but it's not easy to learn a NFL playbook.
I get that, but you're overestimating him.
In any event, I think they can compete for the division.
Maybe.  Just depends on their defense.
See, I think it depends on the arm of Wentz.
To score points, yes, but they can't give up so many easy TD's again.
Yeah, their secondary was pretty poor last year.
We will have to see how they fare this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Browns are going to turn it around this year!
Really? You think so?
The  did really well in the draft.
Did they get some good picks?
Yes, the really strengthened their defense.
They for sure needed that!
They still need a quarterback though.
I agree, that has been their weakness.
They got a quarterback in the draft but he is not a premier player.
Well, maybe they could train him to be.
They probably wont win their division this year.
You never know!
It's been over a decade since they were in the playoffs.
Has it been that long?
Yes, but I feel like good things are on the horizon.
Maybe we should try and get some season tickets this year.
I think that would be a great idea!
I can't remember the last time I was at a game.
Tickets are not very affordable, but maybe we could see a few games.
Yes, season tickets might be out of our league.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL team do you think has the best uniforms?
I might be biased because blue is my favorite color, but the Broncos blue jerseys look pretty great
I prefer their primary orange ones myself, but they're pretty good
There's a lot of blue in the league, like the Panthers all-blue jerseys
Those ones look pretty cool with the black stripes, and so do the Lions' grey and blue
But if I had to choose who has the best uniforms overall, I might go with the Green Bay Packers
Right, the green and yellow is just so iconic that it's hard to ignore
I think when people think of the NFL, they think of the Green Bay Packers
Makes sense, they've been around for a very long time
They played the Chiefs in the very first Superbowl, too, even though it wasn't called that at the time
Speaking the Chiefs, their red and yellow stand out quite a bit too
Sure, but if I have to go with a red team, I'd pick the 49ers and their red and gold
Those are pretty cool, but I don't like their new all black alternate uniforms
Neither do I, but I think that's because they missed a good opportunity to outline the numbers in gold to include all the team's colors
So who do you think has the worst uniforms in the NFL?
Everyone hates on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' new uniforms, but I actually think they're pretty cool
I feel the same way about the Jaguars new multi-colored helmets
They do look odd, but when I look at their old uniforms I think the decision was the right one
I also don't like that the Dallas Cowboys almost always wear white at home games, but I hear that they're changing things around
Yeah, their blue jerseys look much better, and I'm glad we're going to be seeing more of them next season
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe it - the new NFL season is almost here.
I know I know. I love this time of the year...camps, signings, trades, new players...its all great.
Who is your pre-season super bowl favorite?
Of course I have to go with my AFC team - the Patriots.
Whatever - that's an easy no-brainer pick.  But they are a great team.
I am fortunate to live in New England where its safe to love the Pats.
Yeah - no matter where you live though you have to acknowledge excellence - Brady and Bellichek - doesnt get much better.
I agree and am thankful they are on my team.
I appreciate how great they are and yet my team the Broncos are probably their biggest rivals.
I agree they are - mainly because they are also good and play well every year and the game outcome is always up for grabs.
Not like the Bills or Jets - they are welcome mats - terrible and could never be called - a rivalry.
I agree I think for it to be a rivalry in the NFL - the teams must be on par - performance wise.
I agree back in the day when the Raiders were great - the rivalry couldn't get bigger than Broncos-Raiders.
Players hated each other, fans hated each other, coaches hated each other. the good old days!
Right and then the Raiders stunk it up... were terrible for the last 10-15 years and the Broncos moved on.
Add in the free agency thing and its no longer a league that has rivalries in the true sense.
Over all its ok though. I for one prefer the rivalry based upon competition, good play and outcome up for grabs.
Me too, but I miss the old my team above all and loyalty now and then.
Speaking of loyalty - Do you think Bellichek will trade Gronk this year?
I don't see how he could - despite injuries..Brady likes him and relies on him,
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, I think Tom Brady will still complete until he's 100.
Yea, him and Bellichek are one heck of a tandem.
Yea, I agree and I just do not see it changing anytime soon.
I agree! Sometimes age can catch up quick, but I do not know about this one.
Yea, they just build a team around Brady year after year.
Yea, they are the epitome of a team. They just win.
I agree. Hopefully somebody will challenge them in the AFC this year.
Yea, I think Pittsburgh should be able to challenge them.
Are you factoring Bell into that?
Yea, I am, but you never know with that guy.
Yea, he has to learn to stop getting suspended.
I agree! He is way too good to be off the field.
Yea and with Ben Roethlisberger getting older, they could use a nice rushing attack.
Yea, he seems to put himself into harms way too much.
Yea, I agree and as he gets older, he has to stop doing that.
You must admit though, he is a beast and is hard to take down.
Yea, he is a defenders nightmare.
Yea and with an arm like that, he is really amazing.
Yea, having Antonio Brown doesn't hurt either.
Yea, I agree. He is a game changer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Chargers moving to LA?
I think it's cool. Closer to home for me.
What about the Rams? They were already in LA.
I'm a Charger fan for life.
They're temporary stadium is pretty small. Will you be going to any games?
Yeah, I hope so.
It will be hard to get tickets! They are expensive.
I enjoy watching Phillip Rivers on TV so I'm fine with that also.
Yeah he's good. They should have a better team this year.
Do you think they will make the playoffs?
Yes. The broncos and Chiefs won't be as good.
Do you like the Chargers new coach?
Yes, they needed a good change.
how many games do you think the Chargers will win?
At least 10.
Do you think they have a chance at the Super Bowl?
Yes, if they can avoid injuries.
Injuries are hard to avoid.
It takes a little bit of luck to get to the Super Bowl.
Bolt up!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude you think Ezekiel Elliot is going to run for 2000 yards this year?
no not really.
Why not that dude is so good.
No he's not, the Cowboys line is so good.
Ok either way, Zeke was the rookie of the year, that means he's really good.
No it just means that the NFL wants to reward it's position players in big markets.
You're such a conspiracy theorist.
No man, People are just gravitated towards numbers, and since lineman can't really put up numbers, we all just want to talk about how good the position players are.
Yeah but look at some of his highlights.
Any professional running back in the league could do many of those same things.
What do you mean?
Zeke is getting to run through 6 foot holes, anybody would look good with those holes to run through.
So who is a good running back then?
Honestly, I don't really care to label any running back as good.
What are you talking about.
Every runningback is only as good as the line he runs behind.
I mean, I guess.
Look at Emmitt Smith.  He's the career rushing leader, but he had the best line ever, and just happened to never get hurt.
Bro, you're ridiculous.
You just hate me because I'm right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know when the Saints first game is for the season.
Yes it is on September 11
Is it away or home?
Its an away game against the Vikings.
Wonder whos broadcasting it ?
I am pretty sure ESPN has it and it starts at 710 pm.
I know they play the Patriots at home on September 17th i think its an early afternoon game.
Yes its an 100 pm game
They dont have it very easy in theyre first four games.
No 3 are away game and the one home game is the Patriots
Tom Brady and Drew Brees i dont really like eigther one of them as quarterbacks.
I agree neigther one can take a hit without whining about it.
They play the Packers on October 22 thats gonna be a hard game for them to.
They didnt do very well last year.
I know i was so disappointed they didnt even make it to the playoffs.
Maybe this will be their year its time for a superbowl win.
I wish but doubt it. They are up against some hard competition.
I think i might go see the Patriots game since it is at home.
Why Thought you didnt like the Patriots.
I dont but i can Boo Brady and hope we win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new celebration rules?
Well, I'm not that familiar with the specifics.
Mostly it is allowing more celebrations after touchdowns as long as they aren't deemed inappropriate.
That's wonderful, I miss those days of TO and Chad Johnson competing with celebrations.
Me too, I like the group celebrations as well.
It's just like soccer!
I wonder how much they will actually allow.
That's a good point, they may say they are going to relax on the rules, but that doesn't mean they actually will.
I'm thinking they will possibly have some fines for celebrations that they said were going to be legal.
Well, hopefully that doesn't stop the celebrations in the first place!
Hopefully we will also see lots of touchdowns.
More touchdowns equal more celebrations!
I'm looking forward to some Patriots games and there high-score potential offense.
With Cooks and the revamped running backs, they should put up some good points.
A Falcons and Patriots rematch may put up a fair amount of points and have some nice celebrations.
But, Cooks' still can't do his bow and arrow!
That is unfortunate.
I agree, I think they should make some exceptions as that is definitely not a modern weapon or anything.
I agree, but you do have to make limits somewhere and it is easier there.
I suppose so, but that will still lead to some nice fines!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy the NFL?
I do quite a lot.
How long have you been a fan?
For as long as I can remember.
Was your dad a fan?
Oh yeah, big NFL fan.
Did he have a favorite team?
The greenbay packers.
Let me guess Favre is his favorite player.
He loved him.
For good reason he was emotional and his play showed that.
He was one of the best players of all time.
I agree.
Do you think anyone will be as good as him?
I do actually but not anytime soon.
He brought this emotional play that nobody else has.
You felt his emotion as he played it was great.
That's what set him apart.
I do agree with that.
I wish he still played.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever bet on the NFL?
Yeah a bunch of times.
Which team’s chances are being the most underrated by your Superbowl futures? Most overrated?
Teams like the Patriots that are good every year are a little overrated because of public perception. Teams like the Browns or Raiders are typically underrated because of their lack of past success and progression. Odds don’t always reflect the chances of a team winning…they reflect the public perception of those chances. Those can be two very different things.
What is one factor in NFL betting that you think bettors undervalue?
They undervalue certain numbers in NFL. 7 and 3 are incredibly important. The jump from 7 to 8 is bigger than the jump from 8 to 10. The higher the number, the less value.
It’s what they overrate: Especially the delusion that a team who finished last year strongly is sure to pick up where they left off
Generally right. Every team has different personnel year in year out. Have to judge the current personnel. Other teams will improve. The biggest thing is adjustments.
What is your maximum limit in NFL?
I guess you could say we don’t have one because the more volume we see the higher limits will go, but typically, our base max is $30,000, with marquee games and volume often sending it higher. For example, tonight’s game is already at $50,000.
What’s your thoughts on the rookie QB’s? Will Jacksonville & Minnesota be rated higher or lower when Bortles & Bridgewater come in?
it’s really hard to say right now. As important as a QB is, it’s still based on team performance. There has to be a reason the QB is coming in. It may not have as much of an effect as you’d think.
What is your biggest week 1 liability?
I can tell you guys a lot, but I can’t tell you that
How come you don’t offer player props?
General interest. There’s not enough interest for every game. If we found it was there, we’d start offering them.
If you were betting NFL, which experts would you follow/listen to?
I listen to analysts. Sports analysts, not betting guys. Analysts know about injuries, and the up-close info on teams. That’s where the value is in evaluating a team.
Analysts are often generators of public perception.
It’s up to you to decipher the information from the analyst. That’s where value is. Using multiple sources helps too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the 2018 Indianapolis Colts?
I'll be honest, I haven't paid much attention this offseason.
Do you think they will be a good team?
The Colts play in a weak division so they should be okay.
What about the head coach Chuck Pagano?
I personally don't think he is a good coach.
Why is that?
The best season the Colts have had with him was when he wasn't the coach because of his cancer.
I guess that is true.
I think the Colts need to get a good head coach like Jon Gruden.
Why Jon Gruden?
The Colts have Andrew Luck and right now they are wasting him.
How are the wasting Andrew Luck?
Luck is in the early prime of his career and the Colts have a below average team.
The Colts weren't a bad team last year.
The Colts weren't bad because they have a great quarterback, Andrew Luck.
So if you had to guess how many wins the Colts will have this years.  How many do you say?
I say they win 8 to 10 games.
Do you think that is enough to make the playoffs.
I think that's enough to win their division and make the playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe football will be starting soon!
I know, preseason starts in about a month.
Are you excited?
Sort of. My team won't be that good this year.
Who's your team?
I'm a NY Jets fan, but they released most of their players.
Oh yeah, I heard Eric Decker left?
Yeah, so did Nick Mangold and Darelle Revis.
Wow, that's terrible. Where did Decker go to?
Decker went to the Titains.
Wow, he's a good player though.
Yeah, I hope he gets alot of playing time.
He should, they're first game is against Oakland.
Oakland did well last year!
Yeah, they were 12-4 I think?
The Chiefs were too!
They'll do well this year too.
I wonder how the Giants will do, they did so well a few years ago.
Yeah, because they had a Manning brother.
Yeah, both of them are pretty talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's the most remarkable thing about football?
I think it is how in shape all of the athletes are.
Oh yeah, they are machines.
What do you think they do for workouts?
I imagine they are not very intense because they need to save energy for the game.
Then how do they get so massive and strong.
I am not really sure, maybe it is genetic.
Well, most of them are black.
Yeah I have heard black guys are genetically better at sports.
I think it is just the way they are built.
I think that it stems from them not having much growing up.
Sports is all they can afford to do when they are little huh?
Nowdays all of the white kids have ipads and other expensive things.
Kids in the ghetto only have minimal things like a football.
Do you think it hurts the receivers hands to catch the ball?
The QB throws the ball so fast and hard. Id imagine it stings a little.
Well, they wear gloves, but still I think it hurts too.
Plus, they are running as fast as they can, the timing to catch the ball is amaing.
I think the receivers are the most talented players out on the field.
I just might have to agree with you after thinking about all of that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team?
That's easy the Indianapolis Colts.
Why do you like them?
I live in Indiana and got to see Peyton Manning's whole career here.
Peyton really did make football in Indiana popular.
The Colts have become 1000 times more popular since Peyton joined the team.
What was it like before Peyton?
The Colts were terrible.  We never won anything.
Didn't you play in a AFC Championship game?
Yeah in 1995 vs the Steelers.
That was a close game wasn't it?
We lost but we had a chance with a hail marry at the end of the game.
I thought the guy caught the ball.
It was close but he didn't
That was the first time I remember replay being used.
Replay was used before but it was one of the first times it decided the end of game.
Did the Colts have any other good years before Peyton?
No, we had a few years where we only won 1 game.
Well all those bad years helped you get Peyton in the draft.
Thank god, because if it wasn't for Peyton, the Colts may have left Indiana.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL quarterback?
Oh you know is Peyton Manning.
Peyton, why him?
He plays football like a CEO of a company.
That's kind of true.
It is. I always imagine him in a suit and tie  when he's playing.
That's weird and funny. Didn't he retire.
Yes after winning his last Superbowl in 2015.
Oh that's right they beat the Panthers.
Yes they did. It was sad, but had to be done.
Do you like his brother.
Yes I like Eli.
What team does he play for now.
He's still the quarterback for the New York Giants.
He's a quarterback too.
Yes man, where you been!
So those Manning's got it going on.
Those Manning boys had the NFL on lock.
Yes I know Peyton made history.
For sure he will be in the books, but so will his brother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
But the passer rating doesn't account for the team efforts.
Well, it's as they say. it's a passer rating. Not a rating of a performance as the quarterback.
There is absolutely no difference between the two.
Well, the distinction is that to rate a passer on HIS efforts alone is different from rating the plays of quarterback ina game..
Again, there is absolutely no difference between the two.
yes there is, we're only interested in the efforts of the passer. how his team pass protects, or how the receivers holds on to the ball isn't a passer rating
That's such a nonsense. Of course all that has to be reflected on the passer rating
No it shouldn't. What you're talking about is more like offense rating, which we can do.
What method do you use for fantasy? Ideally what would you like to see?
I would like to see the total offense rating as well as the passer rating, but over time against each matchups. But that doesn't really work since the teams evolve and change their offensive cooridators
New coordinators, new approaches, so the performances will be different?
Excatly. It's back to that whole stochastic nature of the agents performing the tasks. There is no way to predict, but we can extrapolate the trends
if you can't predict, there is no point in looking for the trends.
Oh contraire. Trends give us, at least, some insights into how the game will unfold, not 100% at a time, but very often
Well, I guess nothing in life is 100%.
Nope.
it will be cool to have s number like that against the each matchups.
ESPN analysts do have numbers like that, and that's how they calculate the pecentage win for each matchups. And often they're wrong
Stochastic agents again
You got it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Only a few more months until the start of the NFL season.
I know, I am already getting excited.
I feel that my Cowboys are going to win it all this season.
They are good, I think that my Seahawks have a shot at the Superbowl too.
Well maybe we'll play each other in the playoffs for a spot at the big game.
That would be an amazing game.
Yes, if it comes to that, we should go watch the game at a restaurant together.
Yes, that would be great, I can rub it in your face if we win.
I think my side will be the the victorious side in this match up.
Well I think the only competition for our teams are the Packers and Falcons.
Yeah, I don't see other teams giving us trouble, one of these four teams will represent the NFC at the Superbowl for sure.
I am most worried about the Packers, I still think that Aaron Rodgers is the best player in the NFL.
It is very hard to disagree with that.
Yes, there is some solace knowing that the Packers defense is not that good though.
I agree, I think they will have to run up points on the offensive end to keep up with the Cowboys or Seahawks.
Yes, it will be hard for them to run up points though, both teams have good defenses.
I am in total agreement.
Anyway it should be a very entertaining season.
I hope so, I really want to watch some close games.
Agreed, hopefully we can have that Cowboys versus Seahawks match up in the playoffs, it will be a great game of football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which state has the worst football team in the NFL would you say?
I don't know give me a minute
Well I think the Raiders  really have not been popular for a while
Why is that? Because they have the most losses or what ?
That, and possibly their players aren't too good.
It seem like if people like a certain NFL player, then they like the team as a whole
It just seems that they haven't been too popular
I agree. But have you been to one of their games?
Yes. And it was pretty good but they lost
They did? To whom.
The Dallas Cowboys of course
Yes well that's the best team
Maybe. But at least they need to develop a better strategy
Well thats the coaches job
Truely. If the team has a bad coach they wont be winning any games
Who is their coach ?
For the Oakland Raiders?
Yes. Is it still Jack Del Rio?
Yes I think it is.
Oh no wonder they are still losers. I don't think he's very good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Ickey Shuffle?
The endzone dance that Ickey Woods used to do?
Yes, exactly - I think it is great when players celebrate in the endzone!
I agree - what team did Icky Woods play for?
He played for the Cincinnati Bengals.
That's right - and Boomer Esiason was the quarterback!
Yeah, he was a great quarterback.
Very successful - and I thought his final season when he came back to the Bengals was great.
I enjoy his NFL commentary - a great crossover career for a great quarterback.
I think the NFL does really well with its broadcasting commentary - really keeps the audience engaged in the players and statistics.
Yeah, sports statistics are a huge hobby of mine, especially with the NFL.
True - NFL football is quite complex statistically, even more so than baseball.
Speaking of stats - Esiason has a lot of top ten records in the NFL for quarterbacks.
I even remember when he had that terrible concussion from Bruce Smith.
Yeah - hit him under the face mask and down when Boomer!
But he made a great return against the Bills later on in the season.
He was even in that Geico Insurance commercial recently!
I know - he had a very short career due to injuries - he was a great running back.
He has close to 30 records for the Bengals, many of them in rushing.
I didn't know that - I need to brush up on my Bengals stats!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's always disappointing when star players from college wipe out in the NFL
Yeah, I agree. There's so much pressure
Johnny Manzeil turned out to be a dud
So did Tim Tebow
He brought a lot of publicity to the teams though
Like the NFL needs more money
True. More talent less hype would be nice
RGIII is another college star who didn't do so well
I'm glad Cam turned out pretty great
True. He was worth the hype
David Carr was a pretty bad one
Oh he's one of the biggest duds
Along with Tim Couch.
Charles Rogers was also a bad choice
He was a good choice just turned out to not be a NFL player
The Lions did not get their money's worth on that deal
Did you know Terry Bradshaw was bad his first year out<
I didn't that's crazy.
Yep. He turned into a decent QB
Oh for sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Seattle is going to win the NFC this year.
Probably as much of a chance as anybody I reckon.
With Wilson at QB, you can never count them out.
They had a pretty good RB with him in Rawls too.
Yeah, he was a pleasant surprise last year for them.
They have one major sticking point though.
What's that?
Their offensive line.  It might be the worst in the league.
Yeah, the thing about Pete Carroll is they're all in on the defense at the expense of their line.
It really hurts them though.
You can't rely on Wilson to have to scramble all the time.
He's great on the run though.
Sure, but you'd rather him not risk injury running for his life.
How do you think their defense will be?
They get Earl Thomas back which is a huge plus.
Do you think Sherman will be as good?
He will have a chip on his shoulder with all the trade speculation.
I wonder if that will hurt their vaunted team chemistry.
Won't help it.  They should have kept their mouth shut.
Will be interesting to see how they progress this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey
What's up bro
Nothing much
Same
Well shoot
What?
Why don't we fix that
How so?
NFL game talk is on
On what?
ESPN
I don't think I got it let me check
Sure thing
Nope I got no ESPN
Well dang
Yeah blows
Come over we can ball talk
Okay awesome idea
For real.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the upcoming NFL Season start?
The first game is on Thursday, September 7.
Who is playing that day?
The Chiefs are going to New England!
Sweet! I can't wait for the season to start.
Me neither. Which team is going to surprise everybody this year?
It's got to be the Chargers! It's there first year in LA and you got to love their team.
I could see them making the playoffs, but you don't see them getting past the Raiders, do you?
They have a chance, you never know what you're going to get with Philip Rivers.
It's possible but Rivers does throw a lot of interceptions!
Yeah, I know. But you got to have faith! Who do you think will make the superbowl this year?
Patriots and Falcons.
You think it's going to be the same two teams? Come on, that never happens!
Yeah I do! The Patriots are always there so you can't bet against them. Do you at least agree on that?
I'll give you the Patriots. But I'm going with the Seahawks.
The Seahawks were my other option, they had a down year last year. I think they'll be back.
If the Seahawks find a way to get Jimmy Graham involved they'll be back!
They haven't utilized him very well since they acquired him.
They haven't. I bet they wish they had their starting center still. That offensive line has been horrible since.
I know, I think that's why they've thrown the ball so much these last few years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited to see the NFL games.
I am too. I cannot wait to see teams improve.
Of course sports analyzers have the Patriots winning.
Well I hope some other team wins.
YEah that is only fair.
I like the patriots but someone else deserves to win.
I hope they follow all of the rules this year.
I do too. I see certain teams get away with things.
I wonder if Peyton Manning will return as a coach somewhere.
I am not sure but that would be nice.
Did you watch the draft.
yeah I like all of the new players.
I do too. I am excited tos ee the rookies test their skills.
Some are really good.
Their stats are high too from their colleges.
I think all the teams got great draft picks.
I do too. I bet their family is proud.
I know mine would be.
I cannot wait to watch them conquer their dreams in the NFL. I
Agreed, Life is amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you watch football?
Yeah, I'm for the Green bay packers
Pretty cool. I've never been much a fan of football.
Why not?
Well I just think other sports are more interesting.
What's uninteresting about football?
It just feels slow, and less skill.
Okay dude. You gotta love the beauty and strength in football.
And how's that?
Football is about the bulk of the frontline and the precision of the backline
Go on.
In a sense. Football is like a war, breaking enemy lines. It's pretty complicated and there are so many stratgies.
I guess I never really followed football that closely.
You have all these unique soldiers joining the battlefield. The meta game shifts constantly.
In that sense, football seems pretty interesting. Other sports don't have too much meta shift.
Exactly. We should watch a game sometime. Root for the packers with me.
Nah dude. The patriots!
Don't be a bandwagon man.
PATRIOTS!
Alright alright. I'll order the pizza.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Packers fan
Not really,  I am more of a Panthers fan.  They are my home team
They had a grate team two years ago.
I know,. we should have won the Super Bowl.
I think your quarterback Cam Newton is a heck of a player.
He really is a good player.  He can be a little bit of a primadona though.
Are there other teams you like.
Well, my wife is from Indianapolis, so I pull for the Colts as well.
Have you ever been to a game live.
I have been to a few Panthers games, but no Colts games.
How was the Stadium.
The Panthers Stadium is really nice.  I have seen the Colts stadium and it is amazing.
Do you watch a lot of games each week.
Not really, I just watch the Panthers games each week.  I don't really watch other games.
I hope the Falcons have a horrible season.  I can't stand them.
I know what you mean.  The Atlanta Falcons suck.
I hope to be able to see a Green Bay Packers game this year.
That would be a lot of fun.
The NFL puts on a great show at every game.
They really do.  The football, food, and atmosphere make it a great time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like the Pats offensive skill set.
They proved it against St. Louis, and they didn't even have Gronk.
That must have killed him.
Well, he was limited to 9 games, but he was as good as any other tight end.
True, but he is usually way better.You think he'll have a good year?
Yes, I see him on the circuit, no restrictions! He appears ready to go.
They also added the dude from New Orleans, what is his name?
Brandin Cooks.He can really fly?
How fast, faster than Hogan.For sure, not even a doubt!
Randy Moss then! I would not try to compare his speed to Moss.
He was different, almost all throws were upfield. Cooks is a bit shorter, too, but can also play the slot.
Really, they have 5 receivers, all at least very good. Malcolm Mitchell came on strong!
And Amendola keeps taking payouts in order to stay on the team. Danny is still a clutch player.With proper use, he could play two or three more years.
Do you think they should've jettisoned the big back?
Personally, what I think does not matter! We trust in Bill!
LaGarette Blount was on fire last year. He scored 18 touchdowns!
But, maybe Belicek always gets it right with guys. Can you remember any coming back to bite him in the..
No, he is the greatest coach in football history, even above Bill Walsh.
How about Vince Lombardi.He won the first two Superbowls. He would have won more if he came later.
Lombardi was great.But..what if the Pats win it again?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need some football!
Pretty soon, maybe three weeks.
We have to do it this year. Our team is getting kind of old.
We need a running game.
They did alright. He had like 1400 yards or so.
Seemed like less.
The recievers are the best ever. I hope they stay healthy.
They have some rule changes; I think there will be less holding now.
Right, the speed is there if they can get off the line.
Don't they play in the Thanksgiving game?
Yeah, national TV game. It will be great.
Just have to beat Detroit.
Should be doable. Road game though.
We finish up three out of four at home.
I heard you got tickets for the opener!
Wasn't me man. Not that lucky.
I haven't been to a game in a coon's age.
There's nothing like a live NFL game!
We should do it this year. Maybe the Tampa Bay game.
We will clean their clocks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man I am pumped for this upcoming season.
Me too! who do you like to win it all?
I think the Seahawks will do it.
I think they really miss Lynch, this last season was mediocre
Yeah, but Wilson is a great game manager. And, I love Pete Carrol
I like the Packers
Because of Aaron Rogers?
Yup, best QB in the league
I can't argue with that, but he is all they got!!!
They added a nice receiver in the Draft, Malachi Dupre, from LSU
I like that pick too. That division is weak
Yes sir. After Teddy went down, the vikings were finished, and there isnt another decent team
I wish Detroit would get it together, they have a decent QB
Lions always seem on the verge of being good, but just stay mediocre.
Agreed. Any other predictions for this year?
I think Zeke Elliot will win MVP.
I love Zeke, plus that Cowboy's offensive line is beast
Plus their tackle Collins will be back from injury
I cant wait for the season now haha. It will be fun watching Dak and Zeke.
Yup, they are a dynamic duo
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I like it!
Oh?  Who's your favorite team?
Big Bills fan!
Oh, me too!
Bills fan forever!
Since birth here!
That's great man!
Yea, are you going to the game next week?
Nah, I cant
Oh why not?
The wife's mother is going to be in town..
Oh just ditch them!
I'd like to
Why not?
I can't
Don't be a baby!
Haha man if it was only that easy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Pro Bowl?
No, I think it is a joke.
Why do you think that?
I think that it's all for show and irrelevant.
I somewhat agree, although I think those players deserve recognition.
Yes, but an All-NFL team would be better.
I can agree with that.
It just seems that the Pro Bowl game is for revenue, not rewarding success.
I think it's good that the fans are involved, though.
Yes, that is a plus, but it's almost unnecessary.
I wonder if there are other ways to get fans involved like that.
I'm not sure, but maybe scheduling the Pro Bowl at a different date.
Perhaps that would work - obviously the Super Bowl is the prime event.
The Super Bowl is one of the best events in the world.
I agree with you, but generally only Americans play the sport.
Yes, this is true, and likely for good reasons.
Well football is harder to play in areas with few resources.
This is definitely true - not enough resources for pads and the like.
Yes, I agree - which is why soccer is the world sport.
I'm not a huge soccer fan, but I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am sure glad that NFL football is about to begin.
It certainly has been a long wait since the Super Bowl was played. The game was very interesting.
Atlanta really blew the game by not slowing down to take advantage of their lead.
We will see what next season brings. My favorite team the Steelers have a real shot.
That's great because I like the Steelers too.
Their offense is loaded especially if they can come to terms with LeVeon Bell.
That is a sticky situation, he can't lose with the garanteed francise tag salary.
Makes you wonder why he hasn.t signed it yet?
Must be some comfort of a long term deal.
The guaranteed money is really good. he should just take it and play his best.
The combination of Ben, Bell and Brown is devastating and then to add in Bryant.
This is really a scary offense for opposing defenses.
The Steeler defense isn't bad and it got a whole lot better in the offseason..
I like the addition of Alualu and TJ Watt.
The additions to the secondary should allow more man coverages.
Camereon Sutton and Davis should improve a good base group.
The secondary got better with Burns and Davis last year.
The linebackers improved immensely last year.
Sure hated lose of Lawrence Timmons.
He had lost his coverage skills, looking forward to an exciting season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
I think Brady is going to look good again.
I think this year might be their last full year of success.
Why do you think that?
Brad is getting very old - almost 40.
But in Belichick we trust.
Yes, he's a great coach.
This year will be another great year, I expect.
We will see. Even the mad hatter is getting old.
Although this is true, they are timeless.
I think the Packers may give them a run for their money.
We will see - I love Rogers.
Yeah, he's an amazing quarterback.
He is so precise with he football.
I hope Jordy Nelson has a great year this year.
I think he will, but he has slowed down some.
Yes, but he is still a quick and sure-handed receiver.
Ultimately, I think that the Broncos will make a return.
No Manning, no problem.
This I can agree with - go Broncos!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo, what do you think about the Eagles chances this year?
Hey man, I am so excited for Philly sports this year, especially the Eagles.
The Eagles have been making moves in the off-season.
I think Carson Wentz is going to be really good this year.
Yeah he will be. Last year he was really good and he was only a rookie.
He still doesn't have that many wide receiver options though.
Alshon Jeffery is pretty good though, he can go to him.
Yeah I guess, but I'm still concerned about the defense.
Their defense is actually good, they have made some moves.
They got Derek Barnett and Chris Long.
I think they will probably end the season 10-6.
That is a little optimistic, I definitely see them being a playoff team though.
Superbowl team?
We'll see. I don't think so. I think Wentz needs to mature a bit and we need an all-star running back or wide receiver.
Yeah maybe, and an all-star on defense.
Right now I wouldn't consider any Eagles player an "all-star", but an all around good team.
We'll see, anything above .500 I would take.
That's setting the bar too low man, a healthy Wentz will definitely give you that though.
True, I just hope they are competitive.
They will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who is the highest paid football player of all time?
Yes. It's Peyton Manning.
Who has he played for?
He played for the Colts for fourteen years and then spent four years with the Broncos.
How much money has he made?
Around 248 million dollars.
That's insane!
Isn't it cray?
What position did he play?
He was a quarterback.
Did he ever win a Superbowl?
In his final year of playing, he lead the Broncos to a Superbowl victory.
Then what happened?
He retired.
So he won a Superbowl and then quit playing?
Overall, he actually won two Superbowls during his career.
So that's why he's made so much money.
Don't forget he got bonuses as well.
Bonuses for what?
Just for signing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are examples of wrong teams being in the playoffs?
The panthers beat the falcons in the "who is the least crappy in the nfc south" bowl for the honor of facing Arizona's third string QB in the playoffs
Lindley was our 4th, not 3rd QB. I really hated that season.
Wait what? I remember Palmer -> Stanton -> Lindley. Who else was there?
Logan Thomas was just after Stanton
That's Logan "I only throw 88 yard TDs into tight windows" Thomas to you
1/9 81 yards TD. What the heck even was that game.
The completion was his first throw too I think
That's like the 3rd string qb that was ahead of Brady on the pats. First career pass was a 70 yard Hail Mary, then he was like 2/9 for 20 yards and an int after that.
still better than 0/8, he could have at least thrown an interception, then we would know he was at least throwing near a receiver.
I'm not sure which was a more hopeless playoff run - you that year or the Vikings with Joe Webb.
How did we even lose that game when we beat them in their own house a few weeks earlier. That just ticked me off Matt Ryan didn't even seem pumped
That was my first NFL game. Not a great first game. It was the falcons continuously failing to move down the field.
My first season was 2010 and I felt pretty slapped in the face with how that ended too.
Well Ryan "The God" Lindley also almost beat you with 64 yards total in 2012.
Matt Ryan threw five picks he seemed really off that game.
There was a reason for the attitude in the game. That year the team was basically playing for Coach Smiths job.
So we threw the game because mike smith didn't think he would keep his job.
The same way the Bucs are gonna keep missing the playoffs: Mike Smith "Toughness"
Yeah, except Mike Smith isn't running crap but the defense and they have improved from an already solid team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready for the next football season? Are you playing fantasy football?
Yeah I am really ready. I'm tired of no sports playing at the moment.
Who are you rooting for this year?
I think I am rooting for the seahawks
Do you think they will be ready to get back to the superbowl?
I think so, Russell Wilson has been training his body and getting work done
You don't think the trouble between Wilson and the legion of Boom will affect this season?
No, I think that was all created by the media, I really don't think there is any real substance going on here
Yeah I kind of agree with you, I think when it all comes down to it, they all want to get back to the glory of the superbowl
What do you think of Lynch coming back and playing for the raiders?
Yeah I think it is crazy, it will be a must watch game when they play the seahawks
Do you think he will be back to his old self?
I'm not sure, he does not look fast in his training videos, he looks bigger, but he has always been big
Yeah, not to mention that he is one year out of the league and 30 years old
Yeah that is ancient in terms of football
I'm not sure if he can handle the likes of the new and younger players in the league
Yeah I agree, he was a legend, but coming back after a year off is tough. Remember these are all pro players and they are all very good
True that. I hope he does well. Do you think the Patriots are going to repeat?
Tom brady sure looks good, I think as long as he is healthy, they have a really good shot
Yeah, he is old, but as long as he doesn't get hit too often, he will be fine
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new quarterback the Bears drafted?
No. What college did he go to?
North Carolina. He's really good.
Was he picked in the first round?
Yes. He was the number two overall pick.
Does Chicago need a quarterback? I thought they signed a free agent.
They did after the draft. They signed Mike Glennon.
So is Glennon the starter and the draft their back up?
Yes. His name is Trubisky.
I will have to check his footage out. Who was the number one pick?
Myles Garrett. He went to the Browns.
He's that defensive end from Texas right?
Yeah, Texas A&M.
I watched him play in a few games. He really is good.
I was hoping the 49ers would get him but the Browns had first pick.
Who did the 49ers pick up as defensive end? I know they needed one.
Soloman Thomas.
I don't remember him. What college is he from?
Stanford.
Oh. We don't get many of their games broadcast here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if a lot of today's NFL teams are the same teams that were in the beginning when the NFL first started?
Only two of them are.
Which ones?
One is the Decatur Staleys which became the Chicago Bears.
Who is the other one?
That would be the Chicago Cardinals which became the Arizona Cardinals.
Two teams seems like such a small amount.
You have to consider that there were only ten teams at the time.
So ten states had football teams?
No. The ten teams were only in four states.
When was the NFL founded?
Back in 1920, but it didn't use the NFL name until 1922.
I thought the Green Bay packers were one of the original teams.
Close. They actually joined in 1921.
What about the AFL. Were they founded back then, too?
No. They actually weren't founded until 1960.
That's really long time after the NFL.
It is, but because of it, the Super Bowl was created so the rivals could play off against each other.
I catch the Super Bowl every year.
It's my favorite game of the year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Texans Vs. Packers game last night?
Yea, the Texans played horrible in that first half.
I know right. They couldn't even get a field goal.
That's true. Green Bay didn't do as well either.
Yea, they only scored one touchdown in the whole first half.
The second half was a little bit better though.
Yea, both teams moved the ball down the field a lot quicker.
Do you know how many total yards Osweiler threw for?
I believe it was about 184 yards.
What about Rodgers for Green Bay?
I think Rodgers threw for about 209 yards.
How many rushing yards did the Texans have?
I think they had about 123 rushing yards.
What about the Packers. Did they do good in rushing?
They did okay. They had 109 rushing yards.
So the Texans did better in rushing yards, I see.
Yes, and the Packers did better with receiving yards.
Do you remember what the final score was?
Yea, the Packers had 21 to the Texans' 13.
Okay, I think I'll try to catch the highlights on the internet later on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the top running back right now?
I think Leshon McCoy is the best right now talent wise.
Will the Bills ever make it back to the Super Bowl?
They'll need the right quarterback. They haven't had a good one in years.
Did you like the Super Bowl?
It was awful I can't believe James White was that good.
I think the Cowboys will own the NFC east.
They have good young stars, but the Giants always compete.
Who's your favorite receiver.
I like Julio Jones. He is a once in a lifetime player.
Can you believe Carr is the highest paid player ever?
That's crazy. Usually you have to win before they give you a huge contract.
Do you think the Giants will be any good?
Eli Manning is nearly past his prime.
Why won't Brady retire already?
I know. He's achieved everything he can.
The only thing Brady hasnt done is beaten the Giants in the super bowl.
I doubt he ever will. The Giants won't make it back.
Do you think Josh Gordon should be reinstated?
No he's had too many chances and blown them all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When is the 2017 draft anyway?
it's already over. It was back in April
Oh. Ok. Anyone good?
About the same number as usual 253 players. Of them I'm sure many are good.
Who was the worst team last year? Browns?
Yes. They picked a defensive end. Myles Garrett
How much did he get?
fully guarnteed 30 mill for 4 years and 20 mil signing bonus.
Tha;s a lot of money, for running around chasing a guy with a ball.
Hey man, that's an important job.
Woo what happened with that RB from LSU
Leonard Fournette?
Yeah. Where did he end up? He was a beast mode
He got picked up by Jaguars.
How much did he get?
227 mill contract with 18 in signign bonus.
Wait, so he gets paud less than a DE?
Well, the number 1 pick DE, yes.
That's gotta sting a bit
i don't think so. 50 mill vs 45 mill, not a big difference. Sure it's extra 5 mil, but you still have 45 million bucks. That's a lot for anyone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football to start this year.
Last years Superbowl was crazy.
I still can't believe the Patriots pulled it out.
I know that was insane.
I tried not to lose faith during the game.
Me too but it was really hard.
My boyfriend stayed confident the whole time, he knew they were going to win.
One of the biggest comebacks ever.
I really love watching Brady.
Me too he is literally amazing.
I have tickets to some preseason games at Gillette.
Wow thats great.
You should join me, they are really fun.
I would love to go.
I'm also going to see a Dallas Cowboys games, one of my friends is a huge fan.
I've heard that stadium is amazing.
I don't really like the Cowboys but it sounds like a fun experience.
That would be a great trip.
I also enjoy going to watch the Patriots in Baltimore it's such an easy trip from Boston.
They also have a beautiful stadium.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best NFL player of all time?
Tom Brady
You really think so?
Yes
You are saying that just cause he won the Super Bowl
I think he has won quite a few
I admit he is good. But, there are better players
Like who?
Jim Brown
He was good. I have to admit it
But, Tom Brady is the best
How can you say that? He is not even the best quarterback
Yes he is
I think Joe Montana was the best
I forgot about him
See. So, do you agree?
Yes. Joe Montana all the way
He was amazing
But, Tom Brady is in the top ten
No question
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best quarterback in the NFL currently?
I would say Aaron Rodgers.
Not Tom Brady?
Tom Brady just plays for the best team in the league. I think that a sizable portion of his success is attributable to having Bill Belichick as his coach and general manager.
You're not giving Brady enough credit. You don't win five Super Bowls without having immense talent.
I'm not saying that he's not talented, but his first three Super Bowls had more to do with a dominant defense than Brady's play at quarterback.
All I know is that last season, Brady led the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history against the Atlanta Falcons while Aaron Rodgers collapsed against them in the NFC Championship Game.
That is true, but incomplete. Let us not forget that Aaron Rodgers had just completed an improbable eight-game winning streak and had lost his leading receiver Jordy Nelson to injury two games prior.
How does losing one player two games back explain his 44-21 drubbing during the NFC Championship game? Let us also not forget that the Packers were down 24-0 at halftime of that game.
So he had a bad game. He still has the best combination of smarts, throwing ability, and situational awareness of any quarterback in the NFL today.
Which is why he has only made it to the Super Bowl once, right?
It's not his fault that his defense always gets injured.
According to his defenders, it's never his fault. There have been numerous reports from his teammates that he can be difficult to work with, which can be detrimental to the team.
All great quarterbacks can be difficult to work with. If you go on YouTube, you can easily find videos of Tom Brady and Peyton Manning getting into arguments with their coaches and teammates.
Yeah, but I don't think that there exists the same level of resentment from those people towards Manning and Brady as there exists towards Aaron Rodgers.
Let's agree to disagree. So I guess based on your previous comments that you think that Brady is the best quarterback in the NFL right now.
I think that he's the best quarterback not just currently, but of all time. However, if I were to start a team right now, I would pick Andrew Luck just based on age.
Why Andrew Luck? He's been banged up so much the last few seasons that the damage might be irreversible.
He still possess the size, strength, and smarts to be an elite quarterback.
I just find him overrated. Ever since making the AFC Championship Game in 2015, he hasn't been able to return to the playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Seahawks will get back to the Superbowl this season?
No, I think that there defense is no longer on the level that the Superbowl teams were.
Yeah, I have to agree, the league has changed in over the years, more emphasis on passing the ball
Yeah, I don't see the Seahawks winning many scoring battles when airing it out.
They should still win the division though, I think they get to 10-12 wins.
Yes, I can see that, the Cardinals are the only real competition in the division.
Yeah, they may only need 9 wins to win that division.
Yes, unless the Rams end up surprising everybody.
Not happening, they don't have the players to push for a playoff berth yet.
What about the 49er's?
Oh man, they are an absolute mess right now, they will be battling the Rams for last place in the division.
Right, I can't believe how fast they have gone down, felt like the rivalry with the Seahawks was just yesterday.
They were so close to a Superbowl too, one of the best defensive teams during that span.
Yeah, just shows how crazy it is to be a consistent team.
Well getting back to the Seahawks I think they are reloading for another run right now.
Perhaps, it is all up to player development, there anchor players are all in their prime right now.
Yeah, I think they are still a Top 5 overall team.
You're right, however I think the Packers are about to have a resurgence.
I can see that, you got Rodgers for MVP?
Yes, he's going to have an amazing season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Only a month til preseason starts!!
I got it marked on my Calendar man!
This is going to be  Brady lat year right?
Oh man I hope so!!! Give someone else a chance!  I got not his but respect for him, but please go so we can catch a  break!
I don't think the Falcons can rebound after that Superbowl loss man.
Naw, you can't come back from that!
True. Just look at how the Panthers did last year after losing the Superbowl.
Yeah, they drafted Mccaffrey.  They going to run hI'm into the ground!
They better. AND I hope the  refs protect Cam a little this year!
True! I'm thinking the Saints are going to rise back up this year.
I can see that. One last run for Drew  Brees.
He deseve's one more good playoff run. If their defence can hold.
They still doing extra point from 30 yards out this year?
Oh yeah. I didn't think id like it, but I do.
Yeah, it has added so.ething to the games. Until it costs my boys a game! Then it'll be the dumbest rule change ever.
Haha! I feel you man! We agree on the Saints and Falcons. But whis bringing up the rear in the NFL South?
Oh we gonna agree on that too! The Rams!!!
You right!!! The Rams in last place. Goff should start week one and they will go 6-10
Yep. So that my rankings . NO, ATL, CAR, and LA in last
Agree 100 % my man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite football team?
I like the Steelers?
Who is your favorite player on the team?
I like Roethlisberger.
The quarterback?
Yes, I think he is one of the best in the league.
He gets hurt a lot doesn't he?
No not that often. He had an injury that had him out for a couple of games last year.
Think he is better than Terry Bradshaw was?
Well he passed Terry Bradshaw for most passing yards for a Steelers quarterback in 2012.
Oh I did not know that.
Yes, people forget. that was the year that he  threw for 3,265 yards and 26 touchdowns in thirteen games in 2012 as the Steelers finished the season with an 8-8 record!
Amazing. He was sure on his game that year then.
Yes he most certainly was.
I prefer the Dolphins myself.
The Dolphins are ok. They have a nice uniform, ha ha!
Yes, but that is not the reason I like them.
Then why do you like them?
Probably because that was the team my dad liked and I grew up watching them.
Ok, well that makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football isn't coming soon enough
I know. I can't wait for preseason to start?
Who looks good so far
Miami. It is about time
Really, I was thinking Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh has had its time. Need someone new.
What about Carolina?
Cam choked last season after getting to the Superbowl?
Atlanta might do well.
Yeah, they play different than the other teams.
I can't wait for the Dallas vs. Philadelphia game
Me too. Big NFC rivalry.
As long as the Giants are losing, I am fine.
Or the Patriots. We need someone different.
How about those Raiders, moving again?
They seem to move a lot, First Oakland, then LA, then Oakland again.
Could be worse, like Baltimore going to Indianapolis.
That was a long time ago, and Baltimore has embraced their Ravens
Who knows, maybe we will get another team soon.
Or just have one move, again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Who's your team?
Oh I've been a big Seahawks fan ever since Russel Wilson joined.
Yeah he's a great player and he's one of those guys that is super likable. Have you seen his charity work with sick kids?
Hell yeah. I follow him on Instagram. He's such a good guy. Which team do you support?
Well I'm from Cleveland so I feel obligated to support the Browns. I sometimes like the Cowboys though because it's nice to see a team win occasionally.
Oh yeah I feel it. Browns fans are very loyal.
That's how we do it in Cleveland. It becomes sort of a rite of passage in Cleveland to go to a snowy game where the Browns get shut out.
What did you think of Johnny Football?
Well, Cleveland is kind of cursed anyway. But he was just an irresponsible kid.
Why do you like the Cowboys?
Ezekiel Eliot! I'm a big Ohio State fan and I like to keep up with where my Buckeyes go.
Oh yeah that makes sense. He's great. Did you see his ESPN photo shoot?
Yep. He's looking good. And his career is looking good too.
Yes it is. The Cowboys are lucky.
Have you ever been to a game?
Only once but it was great. I'd like to go again but I have to save up the money.
Which game did you go to?
Seahawks 49ers game in Seattle. That stadium is loud!
Oh yeah Centurylink Field is always on the news for being loud.
Yeah that's true. It's even rumored to give the Seahawks an advantage because the other team can't hear.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Colin Kaepernick has a spot on an NFL roster?
I have no idea honestly.
He should not have gotten political.
A lot of people agreed at the time but now there is backlash.
Exactly he may not have a spot next season.
I am surprised the Browns don't want to take a chance on him.
Well they have Brock Osweiler now.
He is pretty good.
Yeah I am sure the Browns will win more the one game with him next season.
The way the Browns played they were lucky to win one game last season.
Good one they definitely didn't play very well.
The team they beat was probably embarrassed.
Yeah that doesn't help your standing.
Is Josh Gordon any good?
He got over 2,500 yards over the course of two seasons.
That is just amazing.
I know some plays would be happy getting 1,500 in two seasons.
I honestly hope the Browns are better next season
Me too that city deserves some success.
Yeah the Cavaliers couldn't bring home another trophy this yeae
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like tampa bay this year?
you mean the bucs?
yeah.
i like them.
i think they might be strong enough to win that division.
me too. i think the falcons will step back.
shoot, i think atlanta will pull a carolina.
what you mean?
i think they don't even make the playoffs.
i know right.
last season was their chance and they blew it.
my money was on the patriots.
you know you got lucky right?
luck ain't have nothing to do with it.
falcons just totally fell apart.
i knew once the patriots cut it to eight that they would pull it out.
biggest choke job in super bowl history.
i know right.
i never did like the falcons.
i liked them when they had michael vick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it too late for Steelers with their current team?
Getting close to it...Ben is getting ready to retire
I still think he has two years...
Not if he keeps throwing bad interceptions
Yeah, some of those picks were pretty bad last year
Almost threw up in my mouth a couple times last year
Worse part is that he is smarter than that.
He gets locked on to Antonio Brown too much
106 catches and 12 tds don't hurt
Yup. The problem is the rest of the receivers can't catch a cold
I hope they get D'Angelo Williams back...he was good
He said wants to come back to Pittsburgh
I hope they bring him back
Me too. Cannot count on Leveon Bell to act right
QBs after Ben is pretty scary too
jones hasn't progressed as well as I had hoped
Offensive line is still great
Yeah. They should be for a long time
So...10 wins this year?
Nah. Eight. They'll lose some stupid games again this year
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man did you get your Saints season tickets in the mail yet?
I sure did. The 2017 tickets look amazing, I love the new deisgn.
Same here brotha! I hope your pretty pumped about getting to go to London for the October 1st game.
Dude you have no idea. Kinda wish we were playing a better team though.
Eh it's whatever. The Doplhins suck but it's just going to be cool to expierence an NFL game overseas.
Hopefully beers don't cost $9 like they do in the Superdome.
Haha I hate that so much. Do you remember the Saints/Raiders game last season when that guy infront of us bought like 20 beers?
Ofcourse I remember that, I also remember how bad of a game that was for us.
It was very close game just like half of the games last season.
Our defense sucks so bad, I'm really losing hope that we will win another SuperBowl.
Gotta have faith man, gotta have faith.
How more years do think Drew Brees has left?
Most likely 2 or 3 but who knows, he could get hurt before that.
He said he wants to retire as a New Orleans Saint so I have faith in that.
Drew Brees is our only hope to win another championship.
We did draft a bunch of defensive players in the draft this year.
I wasn't too impressed with some of our later 5 and 6th picks but overall I thought Mikey Loomis did okay.
Yeah same. I think Sean Payton is making most calls in regards to drafting. Loomis is just a front.
Ha. I wouldn't doubt it but you gotta give Sean Payton some credit, he's a genius and a great coach.
He really is. It sucks knowing Brees and Payton will gone one day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how do you feel about the upcoming NFL season?
I dont know, I am not really into Tom Brady this year.
I can understand that, any other players you have your eyes on?
Not in particular, the last season was very underwhelming.
Some people would disagree.
Would you disagree with me?
I think there are some great up and coming players this year.
No one really stands out to me but I am glad you feel that way.
Are there any teams you are rooting for at least?
Ive always been a Seahawks fan I suppose.
Me too! My entire family loves them.
The Miami Dolphins are interesting too however.
I am not a big fan of anyone on that team but the coach has done good work in the past.
A team is no better than it's coach.
I completely agree, coaches are underappreciated.
Hey, do any of your kids watch football with you?
Roy isn't a big fan, he is more into baseball.
What about Stephanie?
Suprisingly she is always down to watch the games with me.
That is very suprising.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Cardinals player?
I like Fitzgerald the best
A lot of people do
I like all of their players though
Who is your favorite all time Cardinal?
Kurt Warner
He was really good
Yes he was
I loved their Super Bowl team
Me too.
They had a great team
Their receivers were amazing that year
Anquan Boldin as really good. I'm sad they lost him the year after.
I wish teams stayed together longer
Who is Boldin on now?
The Lions I think
Is Kurt Warner still playing?
No, he retired
I wish he came back
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw highlights from Superbowl II last night.
That's a long time ago.
1968.
Who played?
Green Bay Packers against the Oakland Raiders.
The Packers were favored, I bet.
14 points.
Who was the announcer?
Ray Scott, with Pat Summerall and Jack Kemp.
How was the first quarter?
Low scoring.  3-0, Green Bay.
How about the second quarter?
Green Bay scored 13 and Oakland scored 7.
Who played at halftime?
The Grambling State University Band, again.
By the way, who were the quarterbacks?
Bsrt Starr for Green Bay,  Daryle Lamonica for Oakland.
What happened in the rest of the game?
Green Bay scored 10 in the third quarter and 7 in the fourth, while Oakland scored a touchdown.
Sounded a bit boring, if you ask me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was one of the most controversial plays to happen in the NFL
Does it specifically have to be a play?
No anything is fair game it sounds like you have something juicy in mind.
Sort of I think it just stood out to me because it was during the holidays.
Which incident was it?
It was the 1998 Thanksgiving day coin flip.
What happened.
Well the running back of the steelers called tails and the ref said he called heads-tails.
What?
Yeah I know but here is the kicker.
Go on
The coin landed on tails and detriot took possesion of the ball
How!?
Exactly my reaction.
What happened then?
Detroit kicked a winning feild goal in a sudden death overtime.
Are you kidding me!?
I kid you not, thats why it's my top controversial instance in NFL history.
That is crazy.
I know man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who is your SECOND favorite football player?
Ha ha, well it would be a coin toss between Warren Sapp and John Lynch.
Really? why those two?
Well, John Lynch was just so consistant and got the job done.
Interesting, he had good stats?
Every season. He brought it to the house week after week.
Right on. You also mentioned Warren Sapp.
Yes, he was another consistant one with good stats.
Same as Lynch?
Similiar. Plus he had other things going on.
Like what?
Well, he was nick named "The Senator" he use to get involved with the politics of football.
Wow, i did not know that.
Yeah, plus he'd go out of his way to get the fans wriled up.
Seriously, he did that?
Yup. First game i ever attended he was up in with the cheerleaders trying to get fans excited.
That's insane! Good for him.
Yeah, i was bummed when he left. Last i heard he was playing for the Raiders.
Raiders? Really?
Yeah, i'm going to have to look him up. I've seen him in a lot of commercials lately so i don't know if he's playing or not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do they call the American football a pigskin?
That's a good question. It's not actually made of pig skin.
I know, right? They're made of cow leather, aren't they?
Well, the professional NFL ones are, whereas amateurs use footballs made of synthetic materials.
What synthetic materials are used?
Most people use footballs made of vulcanized rubber.
Is that the same material used to make car tires?
Yes, exactly.
So why is the term "pigskin" so popular for the football?
Well, back in the old days before the invention of vulcanized rubber, they used animal bladders to inflate the football. Pig bladders were common for this purpose.
That's kind of gross.
Things have changed a lot thanks to the wonders of modern technology.
Another odd thing about the American football is it's unusual shape.
That's true. No other sport has a ball shaped similar to it.
Why do you think it is shaped that way?
It is believed that this shape was never really designed by anyone specifically, but gradually came to this shape over time.
How is that possible?
The game originally had a round ball, like a soccer ball, but the shape usually ended up lopsided because it was difficult to inflate in those days.
It seems like it is meant to be long and pointy at the end so it will spiral through the air.
That's basically true. In the 1930s, when the forward pass became prevalent, the ball became longer and smaller in diameter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you have a sleeper team this year?
Laugh if you want but I am going to pick the Jags
What? No way.
I realize that they are at least a few years away from anything real, but they have good pieces
Um, I guess?
Well a sleeper to me just means it will sneak up on people. I think they have it.
Yeah I think you are dillustional.
No, look. They have decent D.
Ok, I will grant that.
Their QB is acceptable.
Yeah, no comment there.
Their running game is adequate.
And I will conceed they might be able to sneak up on a few teams.
Exactly! I fugire if they steal a few here and there they might be in good shape
I guess so...
Trust me you will be surprised
Well I will be shocked if they win more than 8 games
So would I.
But progress is progress
Exactly my point!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the series "All or Nothing" about the Los Angels Rams?
You mean the one on Amazon Prime?  I haven't seen that one but I enjoyed the one about the Arizona Cardinals.
Well in the latest series they cover the move of the Rams from St. Louis back to L.A. and the entire season.
I know it was a very disappointing season for the Rams.  They were expecting much better.
The move was disruptive but they didn't use it as an excuse.
I recall that they fired Jeff Fisher with about three games left in the season, which is unusual because head coaches usually don't get fire in the middle of  a season.
Jeff Fisher is highly regarded around the league as one of the better head coaches.
Why do you think they lost so many games?
One problems was a quarterback controversy, which always hurts a team.
That's true.  They gave up some higher picks to draft a new young quarterback and wanted to give him a shot sooner rather than later.
I still don't get their losing records.  The Rams have one of the best running backs in the game and their defense features some All-Pro players.
I agree.  They have a lot of talent on both sides of the ball so that's why the head coach got the blame, I guess.
Their new head coach is very young, under 40, but he did a smart thing in bringing in Wade Phillips to coach the defense.
That is smart.  Wade has been around the NFL for years and has forgotten more about defense than most coaches know.
They held onto their special teams coach and couple others but all the other coaches were let go.
Yeah.  I remember that the special teams coach was the interim head coach when Fisher was fired.
Right.  He coached the last 3 games but didn't do so well although the players seem to respect him.
You have to wonder what their records would have been if they had stayed in St. Louis.
I guess we'll never know but I think they'll do better once their new permanent stadium is finished.
That will probably help from a morale standpoint but a winning records would help even more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think it's hard coaching in the NFL?
Of course. And for so many reasons too.
What kind of reasons?
You're not coaching children, you're coaching grown men who sometimes act like children.
Haha, that doesn't sound too hard.
You have to defend all the plays you call to reporters who twist your words around.
That doesn't sound very fun.
You have to take the blame sometimes for players just not performing how they should.
Why would they do that?
Because a coach is a leader.
I thought the quarterback was the leader?
They're both leaders. The coach is just a more off screen leader.
It sounds complicated.
I think so too.
I don't think I would want to be an NFL coach.
I don't think I would want to either. It's a lot of work.
What happens if you can't do all the things expected of you?
You get fired and they start over with a new coach and try again.
That sounds a little harsh.
NFL coaching can be very harsh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How well do you think the Carolina Panthers are going to do this 2017 season?
I don't know. They didn't do so well this past season.
Yeah ever since that fatal championship loss against the Denver Broncos in 2015 they just gave up.
I hear you. But I heard that they got a new running back named Christian McCaffrey.
I heard that too! He's supposed to be a top notch running back. He was drafted in the first round.
There may be hope after all for the panthers! Isn't there another new player?
Yeah his name is Curtis Samuel his a second round wide receiver pick.
I've heard of him before, he's supposed to be really explosive when it comes to working with running backs.
The only downside is that my favorite player is no longer with the Panthers.
Who is that?
Mike Tolbert. He was the Fullback for the Panthers.
What team is he playing for now?
I heard he is playing with the Buffalo Bills now, in the same fullback position.
Do you know when their first game is?
Yeah it is in California. They are playing the 49ers on September 10th.
Hey thats pretty close to us! We should make a road trip to go see them.
Sounds good! They play around 4:25pm so we can take off after work.
Yeah we will make it on time. What is the stadium called?
It's Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.
Dully noted! Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This year for sure I'm going to get to a home game for the NFL.
That really seems to be your dream since you mention it every year.
It is a goal of mine. I can't believe you hate sports so much.
Yep. not a fan at all.
But you know a lot of players.
Don't let that fool you.
Why?
Because is I know a player's name it's a 95% sure thing that they were once on Dancing with the Stars.
Dancing with the Stars? You watch that?
Yes, and before you mock let me remind you that a lot of the football players you idolize COMPETE on the show, so if you mock me you doubly mock them.
Never thought of that. OK, no mocking.
You know Donald Driver from football, I know him from his killer Pasa Doble.
You do seems to know a lot of plays.
Oh yes, they have the best work ethic so it's fun to watch them compete in a ballroom setting.
Don't you know anything else about the NFL?
I know when a player is dating or married to a celebrity.
Seriously? This is the sum total of your knowledge?
Yes, like Wendy Williams says, the only way I care about sports is if it collides with celebrity.
Well, it's better than nothing.
True. If not for tabloids and dance shows I wouldn't know anyone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is the Bears game on?
Yep!
Who's winning?
They are!
Great.  I bet this is a good game.
It is.
Are they playing the Dolphins?
Yes, in all thier glory.
I think it will be a close game.
I agree.
Some great competitors playing.
Dolphins have a few more strong players than the Bears.
My Bears are strong too!
Yes they are.
The head coach looks stressed.
Yes, he is.
He knows this is a close game!
I'm sure they'll win.
Want to bet on it?
Sure, $20 Bears!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what team are you backing next season for NFL?
I'm backing the Seahawks
Didnt expect you were the type of person to jump on a bandwagon.
What do you mean?
No offense but I feel like over the past few years everyone who doesn't know much about football is hopping on the Seahawks train
Everyone likes the underdog! What do you have against them?
I have nothing against them. I think they're doing well.
Keep in mind as well that I may not be from Seattle, but I am from the northwest. Seahawks is pretty much all we have over here.
Maybe that's why I don't like them. My team is the 49ers
Yes, the San Francisco 49ers are a bit of the hawks' rivals at this point, because of that whole mess with the coach.
Have you ever been to any of the games?
Seattle is nowhere near close to me so unfortunatley not. I hope to one day though.
I'm sure. Seahawks fans seem to be some of the most passionate in the league.
We are for sure! We have a world record to prove it!
What do you mean?
We are actually in the guineess book of world records for being the loudest crowd at a sporting event.
That's cool! I'm sure you wish you were there at that game.
I wish. It was back in 2013.
I bet you I go to a 49ers game before you do.
Let's go to a game where they play each other and we'll settle the score once and for all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Want to go in on something with me
Like what
A fantasy team
What is that
You don't know what fantasy football is?
Nope never heard of it
Wow
What?
Just surprised
Why
Because its popular
It's where you create your own NFL team and stuff
Is it fun
Of course it is
Well how do we do it together
We plan it together as a team
Well I am in
Cool let's start
Yep let's
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you hear any more about Mariota?
What about?
You know, his injury. He broke his leg or something, remember?
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he'll be good by the season start though. He's young and all.
Yeah, not like Brady or something. he's getting old.
Speaking of getting old, you think Palmer is gonna play another season?
As far as I know...and Fitz too.
Maybe their last. I'd like to see them get the Superbowl rings though.
You mean Arizona?
Yup, I think the Cardinals deserve a big win.
I kind of like them, too. Tired of seeing the same teams over and over...
I hear you! No more Patriots or Steelers!
Ugh, can't stand either one of them!
I also kind of want to see the Vikings win...
No way! I'm a bit of a cheesehead so I can't root for the Vikings!
Oh, no! No cheesehead!!
What you don't like Arron Roger's and his hail mary's?
Well he is impressive at that for sure. But no, I don't care for the packers!
Well, then just settle for no Patriots and Steelers.
Sounds good...and Go Cards!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about the NFL.
Okay.
What team is your favorite?
I like the Baltimore Ravens the best.
Oh cool.
Yeah my favorite player is Tim Williams.
Oh he is good!
Yeah he is. What is your favorite player?
I like Chuck Clark as a player.
Oh awesome.
Yeah the team is just the best.
You like it better than the Cowboys?
Well in some ways yes.
They are not as hyped as the cowboys.
I agree.
Yeah that is what makes them also good.
Well it was great talking to you.
Same!
Until next time.
Yeah we will go to a game next time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Roger Goodell?
Don't care for him much. He has a huge ego.
He certainly has a huge ego. He really pursued that Tom Brady suspension the past few years.
He wasn't going to take no for an answer and really got the courts to finally side with him.
Crazy how the NFL and players are litigating each other these days. But, that's par for the United States these days.
It is for sure. You disagree with someone, you sue them.
What else don't you like about Goodell?
He definitely has brought the NFL to a wider audience but I'm really annoyed by the fascination with the London games.
I agree with the London stuff. I'm not sure why he's so persistent about the NFL in the UK.
Who knows. What I do know is that it takes away a home game for one team a year and puts them at a disadvantage.
Usually that is Jacksonville that gets affected.
Yes. Jacksonville seems to be there every year. Also, the start times are annoying.
9 A.M. starts are certainly annoying.
Imagine if you lived on the West Coast. Those games would be starting at 6 A.M.
That is crazy. Hope he never puts a team in London permanently.
He just might. He keeps pushing this London thing.
Is there anything else you dislike about him?
The fact that he's paid an outrageous amount of money.
He is the commissioner of the largest sports league in North America, so it's not surprising.
Not surprising, but the amount he's paid is still outrageous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'd like to hear about the Miami Dolphins.
Sure.    What's your question.
What is Adam Case's thoughts on quarterback.
Case likes a steady quarterback who is a game manager.
Has that been a smooth transition?
Not really.     Ryan Tannehill has had a rough time with it.
I understand, but Jay Ajayi should help
He is definitely a strong back.
What about the loss of Arian Foster.
Shouldn't matter.     Foster was done before he retired.
Any thoughts on Julius Thomas
Great run in Denver, still needs to prove himself in Miami
What has that change been like for the passing game?
Jarvis Landry has also been having trouble with the transition.
OK, so what direction does the offense move in?
I see a reliance on the play-action pass.
That should be fun to watch.
Steady, but it might well be the best chance for success.
Will the Dolphins be a playoff team?
Outlook cloudy, but a definite possibility.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see how the Cowboys lost last year.
Yes that was a close game.
Yes it was devstating as a Cowboy fan.
Yes I can imagine.
I gotta give Aaron Rodgers credit though, he stepped up.
Yes he really did.
That was a high scoring game.
Yes Aaron Rodgers did well.
Yes he is amazing.
Yes I think he does it with his mind as much as his body.
Why do you say that?
A lot of guys can develop a cannon for an arm.
Ok I think that could be true.
Yes, but only some master the mind to know when and how to throw in the NFL.
That is a good point.
Yes I think he is really smart.
He probably is, to be that successful at that position.
Yes he performs well under pressure.
Yes his mental game must be excellent.
I completely agree, he is fun to watch, he is excellent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what is your favorite NFL team?
I like the Baltimore Ravens.
Oh, that's unfortunate. Im a Steelers fan.
Ouch, guess we are rivals huh?
Yeah, I dont like the Ravens, but I respect them
I agree. I dislike the Steelers but the rivalry is great.
Who do you think will get the better of the series this year?
I have to say the Ravens, since Im a fan, but I think both teams will be pretty good this year.
Yep. Plus the teams always play tight games regardless of how good they are.
Thats for sure! There definitely arent many blowouts when they play each other.
They are always rough, hard hitting games too.
I love that. The teams play so hard against each other.
Yeah, it seems like they are mirror images of each other. They both play a very similar style.
That's what I love about the AFC North. The games are close and the style is really fun to watch.
Except for when the Browns are playing.
Looks like we agree about one thing! The Browns are a joke.
Yes they are. Even though I dont like them, I want to see them get better so there's more competition in the division.
For sure. I want the AFC North to be the best division in football.
Agreed. As much as I hate to say it, Id rather a team from the division won the Super Bowl even if I hated that team.
Yeah, me too. I dont see the Browns doing that soon though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about NFL football.
Okay cool.
What team is your favorite?
The Seahawks.
Oh awesome. What player is your favorite?
Jordan Roos.
Oh cool, he is mine too!
What other player do you like?
Frank Clark.
Another great one!
I agree!
Have you been to a game yet?
No not yet.
Me neither. We should go together sometime!
Agreed!
Next year's games will be amazing.
Yeah they totally will.
It was great talking to you!
Same!
Until next time.

I'm thinking of volunteering at the Superbowl this year.
You'd be great. You're a real NFL aficionado.
True, I hope to God the Vikings make it this year.
Don't hold your breath on that one. Just enjoy volunteering for its own sake.
I don't know where they'll put me. I'd love to be one who takes visitors around and show them our city.
Pray that the weather isn't terrible. You just never know with Minnesota.
True, it could be 20 below zero, or have 3 feet of snow or be 50 degrees and sunny.
Or you could have all three of those things in the course of three days. Weather here is unpredictable.
I wonder who will play the half time show this year.
I seem to recall hearing that someone was signed but for the life of me I can;t remember who.
I'm so excited for the first game of the season. I can't wait to get in the new stadium.
It looks great on TV so in person it must be really nice.
I want to see those expensive suites,
My cousins buy season tickets and when they had an open house for the new stadium my cousin was walking along the side of the building and randomly tried to open a side door.
What happened?
It opened. He walked right in and slipped into one of the fancy suites where the beautiful people were having a party.
They didn't kick him out?
Nope, he blended right in.
They make you go through metal detectors but don't lock the side doors?
I know, right? A couple weeks later was when those protesters got in and climbed into the rafters. They better up security.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best teams will be this year?
Of course the Patriots!
Well no doubt but I hope someone can finally beat them this year.
I agree. there are other teams that deserve it.
It would be nice to see someone else win the superbowl.
I agree. I get let down when they always win.
I think that Colt's will do better this year.
Hopefully after losing ryan grigson it helps them.
I agree, Hopefully the new guy hired better people.
I believe in them,
I think the Seahawks will do good.
Of course, they are a very competitive team.
I hope Cam Newton does better.
I do to. It was sad watching him get let down and frustrated.
I think that team will do better.
What team does he play for.
He plays for the Carolina Panthers.
That's right.
I am looking forward to watching this new season.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ready for a Miami Super Bowl?
That's funny, Don't see that happening.
We do have Suh!
Detroit didn't even want him.
There's always a chance.
Yea, if the city of Miami bids on a Super Bowl.
You know Marino ain't coming back.
Marino? I'd settle for Scott Mitchell at this point.
Oh it's not that bad.
I bet they don't win 5 games this year.
Even with two against the Jets?
I don't see much success from this team.
I bet they have a winning season.
I hope you are right and I am wrong.
I wonder what Don Shula would think?
He'd make this a better team in a hurry.
Still has the only undefeated team in history!
He was a great coach.
Yea, they don't make them like that anymore.
Well, I'm still ready for some football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey lets talk football. I want to see what your thoughts are on the upcoming season.
Yeah I can't wait to get back to pigskin football again.
What are your thoughts on the Falcons this year and if they can bounce back from that collapse in the Super Bowl?
I think they shoud be fine and it was just inexperience which caused for the game to go the wrong way for the Falcons.
I think they should be able to make it back to the playoffs again. Matt Ryan is an elite quarterback in my mind and should be more experienced this time around.
Talking about elite quarterbacks, your thoughts on the other big name ones in the NFL?
I think Joe Flacco will have a breakout year for the Ravens, and Andrew Luck will finally get what he needs and gets further into the playoffs
I think thats saying a whole lot, as these guys are great quarterbacks, but their teams as a whole aren't talented enough to move deep in the playoffs.
What are your surprise teams this year?
I think Jacksonville should be a contender, same with the Tennessee Titans and Tampa Bay.
Tampa is definitely talented. Jameis has the tools to win, and I think Doug Martin will have a bounceback season.
Who are your surprise teams this year?
I really do like Washington this year, as well as Tennessee.
What do you like about either team?
Washington has the talent, just not the chemistry which defiitely can cause problems.
Yep, big egos between teammates never workout in the end.
I also do believe that Johnny Manziel will be back in the NFL and be a decisive playmaker.
The kid definitely has talent and looks to be a safe spot for whoever decides to roll the dice on him.
I don't think its beneficial for anyone to get Johnny Manziel
Yeah you are right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the season starting in less than two months?
I am very excited. It's going to be an interesting year, especially for quarterbacks.
People are saying that Eli Manning doesn't have much left in his tank, and that Drew Brees won't be playing much.
I heard the same thing. Tom Brady is getting older, too - though he says he feels better than he did 15 years ago.
What about Aaron Rodgers? I read somewhere where he is expected to have a pretty good year, which is good news for the Packers..
Their season is really back-loaded with the easy teams, so they could very well make the playoffs.
My team (Carolina Panthers) won't be going with them. Predictions are they won't even win 10 games this year. So much for Cam Newton being one of the best quarterbacks of all times, huh?
Yeah, he really has been disappointing since that breakout season in 2015. I wonder what happened. Too many expectations?
Maybe - that or the Panthers just aren't that well-coached.
Newton just doesn't get a lot of protection from his offensive line. That might be the biggest problem.
Who do you think will have the worst season?
I dunno. Probably the San Francisco 49'ers. Maybe they need to bring Joe Montana out of retirement.
Ha! He could probably do better!
You talked about Aaron Rodgers. Why has he held up better than Brady?
I'm not really sure. Maybe Brady has been injured more than Rodgers. They're about the same age, aren't they?
Yeah, I think they are both in their late 30s.
You would think that Rodgers would have a tougher time physically from all those games he plays in Green Bay.
Well, it's not that much warmer at home games for the Patriots!
That's true.
Too bad they all can't be played in Miami!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think it may be time to change the rules in NFL Football.
What? Why? I think things are going pretty well these days.
They are, but having some new rules and scoring opportunities may put some more excitement into the games.
In what way?
So, they got rid of tie games a few years back, but I think there could be a better way to score points in field goals.
Okay, I'll bite.  How would you change it?
Well, since it's a lot harder to hit a field goal from further back in the field, I think it would be cool to add in more points on longer field goals.
That might be interesting.
So, for instance, field goal points could start at the 30 yard line with 1 point, then 40 yards with 2 points, 50 with 3 points and so on.
So, in the new point system, there could be a lot more field goal kicking?
Yes, this would definitely change the game from a ground game (pass or running play) to more of a skill game for the kickers.
I could see the kickers becoming as important as the quarterbacks in your scenario.
Yes, can you imagine if a game came down to a field goal?
Yes, I can see it now.  Time running out on the clock and the team has to make a choice as to how to handle it.
And because it's a close game, the offensive team might opt to kick a field goal.
Versus doing a Hail Mary pass, that might make a lot of sense.
Can you imagine the pressure on the kicker if the team runs a field goal play?
Scoring might be a big pain, though.
But I do think that it would lend a lot of subtle strategy... Maybe, someday, the NFL will make the change.
Until then, the teams should continue to practice a Hail Mary pass.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, are you ready for football this season?
I've missed football so much since it's been gone!
I know, it's not the same without it.
Who are you looking to win it all?
I think the Pats will be good again this year.
What do you think about the Kansas City Chiefs?
I think they'll take a step back since a few key players are gone now.
Yeah, that's probably right.
I also don't think Alex Smith can take them all the way.
He's just way too average, I agree.
Who do you root for?
I am an Oakland Raiders Fan!
I think the Raiders are really up and coming.
Derek Carr is a beast!
Yeah and they even have beast mode now!
Oh yeah, I forget Lynch is on their team now.
He's amazing.
I hope the year off won't hurt him.
This year should be interesting!
It always is!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is the deal with Jacksonville?
What do you mean?
Well, why do they consistantly have bad seasons?
That's a good question.
I mean they have to get good draft picks, why can't they develope them?
Well, sources say Coach Gus Bradley needs to be replaced.
I can believe that.
Also, most of the players ae under 23, hard to develope good players straight out of high school.
HA! That's true.
I also hear Monte Kiffin is comin out of retirement to save the Jags.
Really? he's gotta be on life support.
Probably.
Plus they let a lot of free agents just show up and play.
I see what you mean, they cant gel as a team.
So bad coaching, free agents and when they DO get some good drfts they wind up hurting themselves.
Really?
Yesh, the last passer they acquired got his passing had caught in the garbage disposal!
That's crazy.
Hopefully they will ditch Gus, get some solid players and get out of the 3-13 funk.
Fingers crossed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Steve Smith Sr. retiring last year?
Man I can't believe you asked me that.
Come on, why you say that?
I feel lke I lost my best friend.
Ha, you crazy.
You know Baltimore my team right.
Oh ya'll done.
Tell me something I don't know.
Steve was the man. Loved his play and smack talk.
Me too. Followed him since he was with th Panthers.
Yes he did well on that team. Why he leave?
They let him go.
Was it about money?
Man it's always about the money.
They should have kept him.
True but I'm glad he came to my team.
I heard once that him and Cam didn't get along.
That's somewhat true. Steve was trying to teach him the ropes.
That age difference probably ruined it.
Yep them young quarterbacks just won't listen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you think the greatest quarterback ever was?
In my opinion it was Peyton Manning. What about you?
I knew you were going to say that! for me, it is probably Tom Brady.
I respect your opinion, but I don't agree.
You don't have to agree, his rings speak for themselves.
I wish Peyton had a better team a lot of the time he was playing.
You can't blame his shortcomings on not having a good team!
I'm not, I'm just saying if he had a better offensive line, he probably wouldn't have ever gotten hurt.
And what does that have to do with this conversation?
If he didn't ever get hurt, and he had a good offensive line, he would have won more rings.
I don't know about that.
The only person worth anything on the line was the center Jeff Saturday.
This has turned into a pity party for you and Peyton.
No, I'm just saying.
Just saying what?
It requires help. A quarterback can't do it all by himself.
Yeah I guess that's true.
And tom has had a lot of help.
I can't argue with that.
Good, so don't even try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the new NFL season
My either, who is your favorite team?
I always grew up watching the Chicago Bears
They are fun to watch and that's a great city, but it seems like they lose a lot.
You are right they do
So why do you like to watch them so much?
I have watched them my entire life so it's a bit of a tradition
That makes you a true fan
What's your favorite team?
I like the miami dolphins
How come you like that team?
I was born in florida and lived there for 20 years
That sounds like paradise
It was, I loved it everyday
Unfortunately the Dolphins have also been no good
Yeah they have a lot of issues including their offense
I'd say their defense and special teams are horrible too
I have to totally agree
I don't see either of our teams winning the superbowl
I agree, we are both losers haha
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL preseason is almost here! Who do you think is the best kicker in the NFL?
I think there are lots of underrated kickers and punters in the NFL, but some of my favorites are Mason Crosby and the punter Johnny Hekker.
Mason Crosby had a really good year last year, he led the Green Bay Packers to a couple of close wins!
Yeah, it's hard to believe a few years back the Packers were considering getting rid of him.
I read that Mike McCarthy designed a performance based contract for him the following year and something about that help set him straight.
Incentive based contracts for kickers are pretty tough to design, since they don't determine how often they are on the field, but they do help the player get focused.
It's too bad Green Bay couldn't have done that with their punter, it seems like a revolving door of punters there the last few years.
I know they had Masthay forever, but then they brought in competition at camp and ended up keeping Schum.
It doesn't seem like they improved much on special teams, but luckily, Crosby didn't mind him as a holder for kicks, so it wasn't that disruptive.
Well the way those NFL kickers and punters practice, I'm not surprised that they eventually got into a good rhythm.
Yeah, I think that's why Johnny Hekker is so productive for the Rams, consistency.
He also has a heck of a leg and can really move the ball down the field, as well as do some crazy directional kicking.
Probably why he was selected to be the punter at the Pro Bowl last year!
He is definately one of those guys in the league that stands out in a good way.
I've seen him in games completely flip the field and get good position for the defense.
I wonder why it didn't lead to many Rams wins last year?
I think that was a product of bad coaching on the part of Fisher.
It wasn't all Fisher's fault, they had not one consistent quarterback on the roster.
Jared Goff is the future of that franchise, but the jury is still out on how the future will shape up.
He just needs to be able to ignore the pressure and execute the game plan, because her can throw.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Last season, the offense was the ball and chain of this team.
Defense was fine and ST wasn't particularly inspiring. Texans did two things I felt they had to do to give the O some pop - they drafted a QB and also a young gun back.
RT could have been addressed as well but I won't grumble about ZC at 57!
I think we will see a lot of pounding the rock this year and the running game should be ranked very high.
Miller should be a lot more dangerous with fresher legs and should stay fresher throughout the season.
Foreman will be the hammer with some surprise receptions along the way.
Sure, we have no real clear picture at RT, even with Giacomini on the team, as he might yet get hurt again but we do have several young guns to coach up.
I think Mancz will retain his C position and Martin will compete for the RT job.
I also see the receiving corp being very competitive with another season under their belts.
I've been waiting so long for Savage to take the reins I am pretty excited to see him in action from game 1.
But in the back of my mind I keep thinking that Smith will demand that Watson play much like he did with Brock.
I am not confident about the offense not one bit.
That skit display we witnessed last season was unreal.
No creativity whatsoever especially in the red zone.
. We are starting another mediocrity at best quarterback.
Bill O'Brien calling the plays again which is meh.
. Health to the offensive line will be crucial.
I agree. The creativity is as bad as Kubiak days were the only time we fooled anyone it was a bootleg.
. I was watching the reshowing of Seattle vs Denver week 3 last year , last night and the Seahawks got the ball and went 3 and out.
Then Ball fumbled on Denvers first play around the 30.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team?
Mine? Oh, I don't know.
How can you not know? You watch football every Sunday, Monday, Thursday, and Saturday!
Saturday is college football.  That doesn't count.
Whatever. Why do you watch every Sunday if you have no favorite team?
I have favorites.  But not just one...I have many!
How does that work?
Perfectly!  In every game, I chose a favorite, and then as I cheer, every game has meaning.
But what happens when your favorite teams play each other next week?
That's easy.  I cheer for the one least likely to win.
What?  You cheer for the likeliest looser?
That's right!
That means you lose most of the time!
Only if you are obsessed with scores.
THis is football!  Of course you are obsessed with scores!
Not me.
If you don't care about scores, then you don't care about winning!
Not true.
How can you win if you ignore the scores?
I win each and every time I support my teams.  And cheering for them helps make up for the fact that I bet against them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's catch the game tonight at my house.
Okay. Who is playing?
The Bears and the 49ers.
Okay. That doesn't seem like an excited game.
All NFL games are worth watching.
Maybe, but some are better than others.
That is true my friend, but at least it is football.
Yes, and it is away from the house for a while.
See, football to the rescue.
I will be there. I may fall asleep though.
Is life hitting hard right now?
Yeah, just exhausted. School is kicking my butt.
At least the game can be a good escape.
I can definately use one of those.
I am glad to help.
I will even leave my books at home.
You better dude.
It's good brother.
I will have pizza.
I will bring drinks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Keenan Low?
No, what happened?
He's a free agent now.
No way.
Yes, he got dropped.
From the Patriots?
Yes.
Did something happen?
Yes, he got injured really bad.
On the field or practice?
During the pregame season.
Oh no.
He pulled his ACL, and got an ankle sprain.
That sounds painful.
I know it was.
What's his new team prospect?
Nothing yet.
He probably needs to heal more.
Yes, I'm sure.
He'll be ok.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that football games in the NFL are way too long, don't you think?
Yeah, definitely. I think it's due to all the time outs and commercials.
That's what it is. There is just way too much commercials.
Well, that's how the NFL make their money. So I'm not surprised.
I'm just surprised that a game that is supposed to be an hour is now taking almost four hours to watch. That is ridiculous.
Yeah, and it's even worse when you live in the East Coast.
Exactly. I think the NFL has gotten too greedy with trying to squeeze in as much ad time as they can.
Yeah. But I don't see them changing it anytime soon.
I actually think that fans have started to revolt against it. With the internet, more and more people are watching games by other means.
That's what I heard. Wasn't footbball ratings down last season?
Yeah it was. And I think part of it was the fact that a lot of people are just tired of all the commercials.
Probably. But do you actually see the NFL cutting down on commercials?
They're gonna have to unless they want people to stop tuning in.
If that's the case, then the NFL is going to have to figure out how to make money with less commercials.
One of the things I heard was that they were considering putting sponsors on team jerseys.
You mean like company logos on the team uniforms?
Yeah. I think that's one way they can make money with less commercials.
I would actually be for that if it meant shorter NFL games with less commercials.
I would too. But it's going to be odd buying a jersey with a logo from a corporation on it.
If it means I can go to bed at a reasonable time because I don't have to watch a four hour game, then it's fine with me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think the Seahawks will win their division this year?
I do.  I don't think that they will have too much trouble.
You don't think that Arizona will challenge them?
No, though I think they will do better then San Francisco will
Yeah, probably.  What about the Rams?
They have improved but I think they still need a piece or two before they are a challenge.
Where do you think they need to improve?
At quarterback and Defense.
Yeah, they are pretty strong now with their offensive line and running back.
Right.  But I think Seattle will have no problem beating all them.
Do you see any challenges in the rest of the NFC for Seattle?
There will be a couple I think.  Like Carolina and the Lions.
Can't forget about Green bay. They are always there.
That's true.  Rogers is still at the helm so anything can happen there.
What about the NFC East.  They are usually pretty tough.
I know.  I think that the Giants may be there and who know's about Dallas.
Yeah, it's hard to say which Cowboy team will show up.
Or if any will now that they are all getting suspended or arrested.
Right.  Well, don't count out their new quarterback.
I don't think it will be an issue for the Hawks this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What caused changes in Todd Gurley's play between 2015 and 2016?
Todd Gurleys 2016 stats pale in comparison to what he did in his rookie season.
I've heard rams fans claim this was either because opposing defenses stacked the box in the face of an anemic rams passing attack, or because gurley's actual play got worse.
RT Rob Havenstein regressed due to an ankle injury. Center Tim Barnes went from inconsistent to just bad. We lost Garrett Reynolds who was actually a really good run blocker. Jamon Brown/Cody Wichmann/Andrew Donnal all were poor guards. It got worse for sure.
And also, it did suck in 2015 too. Aside from Gurley's hot start in his first 4 or so, he really didn't do a whole ton the rest of that year either. Mostly just the occasional big play that we didn't get this year.
How do you think he'll do this year? Have they made any changes to the Oline?
Kromer is a fantastic OL coach. Aside from beating 14 year olds up, they were lucky to get him. He turned our OL into what it is right now.
he wasn't much of a coordinator but gave the bears the best O line they've had in my lifetime.
That's gotta be the oddest collection of aging vets and young talent. Did they draft any depth to develop at C or OT?
They felt confident in the OL we drafted in 2015, so I'm guessing Kromer thinks he can mold them. We did sign a guy, Jake Eldrenkamp that we apparently loved and were willing to draft. He's our backup center competing with Austin Blythe who we signed off waivers from the Colts.
Imagine if you took Dan Marino and put him (with all the modern conditioning and sports science) in charge of a modern spread offense. How much better he be?
Put Cam Newton on a team from 40-50 years ago and you have unparalleled domination.
Put Cam on the Air Coryell Chargers with people like Alworth Winslow and Joiner. You have a qb who can move like crazy and has an amazing pass offense.
Alternatively, put him on a Wing or T or whatever offense of the 30s-50s. Although the culture wouldnt be positive, his athleticism would wreck defenses
You think he gets vilified now, imagine 50 years ago as the first black quarterback
He wouldn't be vilified... He would be a sports legend.
The first black qb threw for 5122 yards in college earning the right to be drafted in the 14th round to play cornerback.
he had to negotiate his own contract with the Broncos to say he must have a three day trial at qb so he could use the public and press attention at the camp to his advantage. He managed to get the job because there was no one else.
I'd say the same of Vick as well, if not more so. Newton is harder to bring down, but Vick had an elusiveness that made him a 1000+ yard rusher even in the current era.
Jesus, Vick in that era would be like Bo Jackson in Tecmo Bowl!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite football team in the NFL?
Not really.
Why not?
I like a lot of teams.
They do have lots of talent out there.
I guess I would say the Bears if I had to narrow it down.
Who is your favorite all time Bear player?
I think that Refrigerator Perry tops the list.
I would agree.
He was top on the field.
No one could get past him.
Who else is your favorite all timer?
I liked Jim McMahon.
He was quite a quarterback.
Those were the days.
There are some real stars today, but I loved football back then.
Nothing like it.
You bet.
I would have loved to see those players in person.
That would have rocked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who you picking to get to the Superbowl this year?
Tough one, man. Let me tell you who I want.
Ok. Who then?
I want the Falcons back.
Who else.
Not the Patriots. That's for sure. Raiders or Broncos.
Ok. Now why do you like those match-ups?
First. I'm a Falcon fan. Last year. That's rough. That's just a rough way to end the year.
Agreed. What else you got?
So with the Raiders, I want to see Carr at full health. And of course Marshawn. I feel like he got robbed a few years back, you.
Yeah. I can understand that. What else on those two teams, Oak and Denver?
So, I know with all the Warriors' success, it's not like Oakland's in no-man's land or anything. I just feel like it would be great to win before they leave. I also just want Lynch to blow it up, you know?
I do. I do. And the Broncos?
Mostly fan base. NFL hype. You know, either of those match-ups, Denver-Atlanta, Oakland-Atlanta. It'll be good PR. I mean, it'll be a lot of hype and lots of folks'll watch.
Yeah. Yeah. For me, just my bias, I'd like to see Oakland.
They've got a good shot. Too much can go wrong, though, you know. Always too much can go wrong.
Yup. But it'd be good. Man Raider nation would go crazy if they make it to the Superbowl, even more if it happens before they move.
Oh, I know, right? I would definitely tune in for that. "Must See TV," for sure.
So the A versus Oakland or Denver? I could live with that.
Yeah, man. Here we go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
It's fun to watch!
Do you go to many games?
Nah, not really
Just watch on TV then?
Yea, mostly
Same here
Yea I'm too poor!
Me too!
I like getting drunk watching from home
I do that too!
The wife gets mad sometimes though
Oh does she?
Yea, says I'm too drunk
Haha!
I only had 10 beers
Only 10...?
Yea that was nothing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, watching the Browns last year was rough.
They were just inept, weren't they?
They just had no talent anywhere on the field.
Their QB play was horrendous.
Yeah, didn't matter who they threw out there.
Didn't they have the one guy from Washington?
You mean RG3?
Yeah, that's the guy I was thinking of.
Yeah, he played a few games for them.  I thought he got injured again.
Wouldn't surprise me.  Dude gets injured every game I think.
Their other QB's were all garbage though.
Everything about them was.
Their defense was atrocious too.
I think they've drafted a lot of new guys though.
Yeah, they have.  Their front office is all about analytics.
You mean finding guys who might not fit a profile but can ball?
Right.  Might not be the right height or weight, but are good players.
We'll have to see how that pans out for them.
Yeah, give them two or three more years before you proclaim judgment.
That division's a tough one though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts about the NFC East this year?
Hard to tell. I would assume that the Cowboys are still the best team in that division.
I agree. Their offense is still one of the top ones in the league.
They did lose some players on defense and that will definitely hurt.
Their defense has been their downfall over the past few years.
It seems to let them down at the wrong times. I could see them going either 12 and 4 or 11 and 5 despite the defense losses.
Sounds about right. What about the other three teams?
That's a difficult assessment. The Redskins, Giants and Eagles didn't seem to make a huge splash in the offseason and they were all mediocre last year.
Mediocre is right. They are basically eight and eight teams.
Eight and eight, but if one of the teams get hot, they could end up ten and six.
Which of those teams is more likely to get hot?
I don't know, probably the Giants. They still have Odell Beckham and he can win a game or two just by himself.
Giants always seem to be in the mix.
Yes they do. The Eagles and Redskins are pretty much feast or famine. Playoffs one year and out of playoffs the next.
This will probably be a year where both teams are out this year.
I could agree. I guess my final prediction is Cowboys 12 and 4, Giants 9 and 7, Eagles 7 and 9, Redskins 6 and 10.
I could see that. I will go with Cowboys at 12 and 4 and Giants at 8 and 8. Eagles and Redskins both at 6 and 10.
Not too far off of my prediction.
Not at all. I would be surprised if anyone besides the Cowboys won the division.
Same here.

Hey, what do you think about football?
I really don't want to talk about it
Oh, why not?
It causes fights
You get in fights over it?
Yea, I often do
Oh yea I really want to avoid that
Well... I do like the Seahawks
The Seahawks!?
Yea, they're my team
They suck!
Take that back!
Why!?  They're horrible!
Oh yea!?  Who is your team then?!
The Patriots!
The most hated team in the NFL?
I wouldn't say that!
At least my team plays with an inflated ball!
Okay we should stop this...
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the biggest offseason acquisition this year?
Honestly it is hard to pick just one, there are so many players moving teams.
Well ok, pick one that you can think of that has some importance.
I think Brandon Marshall the WR signing with the Giants was a big deal
Him and Odell Beckham should make a good duo that is for sure.
Not just them being a duo, Marshall should take some pressure off people double teaming OBJ
Sterling Shepherd should have a decent season because of Marshall as well.
Him and the new TE they drafted should see plenty of looks based on how they spread the field.
The passing game seems to be there for the Giants, but the running game is still lacking.
Well Paul Perkins looks like he could be the starter with Rashad Jennings filling in. I am not sure on their ceiling though.
Shane Vereen has always been a good 3rd down back
He has, I am not sold on Perkins nor Jennings on being the bell cow of the Giants backfield
If I had to pick, I would say Jennings will be the top guy based on the fact he has been around the longest
That could be true but young guys are always looking to take their chance
How far do you see the Giants going?
I think they will finish 8-8. Eli Manning just isn't as good as he used to be.
Any other offseason moves you think are important?
WR Alshon Jeffery going to the Eagles is big.
That is a fact, he should prove to be a huge weapon for that offense.
Wentz should be a better QB because of Jeffery. Hopefully he stays healthy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, I can't hardly wait until football season!
Yeah! College football looks great, but NFL should be even better!
What do you think about the teams in Los Angeles?
You mean the Rams and the Chargers?
Yeah! That's really interesting how the Chargers ended up moving to LA too!
I don't know that LA fans really care about either of the NFL teams in their city.
What do you mean? Everyone likes NFL football.
LA already has two great football teams. UCLA Bruins and the USC Trojans.
But that's college ball, and it's different from NFL.
Yeah, but I really don't think LA fans want one team, much less two crowding up their city even further.
True, what's the point of going to a game in Carson if it's going to take you half a day sitting in traffic to get there and get home?
Plus it's such a small stadium. I know they're going to build a new one in the future, but it's a soccer stadium as is.
So what was your favorite thing about last season?
My favorite thing? The fact that the Patriots showed everyone that they were boss, and that "deflate-gate" was all nonsense!
What do you mean by that?
Man, I feel like ESPN just wanted to crucify Tom Brady. By winning the superbowl, even with his beginning of the season suspension, he just proved to everyone that he really is the best quarterback in the league, playing on the best team in the league.
Yeah, but they almost got beat!
Right, but they came back from being down two scoring drives to win! It's like running the boston marathon, never give up!
Alright, dude. Nice talking to you. When the season starts up, I'm coming over!
Just bring the beer!
XXXXXXXXXXX
This should be very exciting. Don't you think?
I think will be.
I think the Panthers will go back to the Super Bowl this year. Who do you think will go?
I think it will be the Patriots this year and they will win
Yea but Tom Brady is getting close to retiring.
Yeah and hes trying to get more rings before then.
That's very true but as long as he stays healthy.
I think he will.
Who is your favorite player? Mine is Luke Kuechly.
Mine is Antonio Brown.
He is a really good player and he might get the MVP this year.
I think he is a good candidate for that.
Who do you think is the best defense in the NFL? I think it is the Cowboys.
I think it is the Steelers.
I think the Cowboys have the best offense too. What do you think?
I think they have a good offense but the best offense is the Panthers.
That is very close but its hard to choose between the two.
Yea but the Panthers are just a little better than the Cowboys.
I dont know. I wish they could play in the Super Bowl against each other.
Yeah that would be a good game
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love football and can't wait for the season to start.
We usually have our fantasy football draft on labor day weekend.
That sounds like fun!
We hold two drafts, one at noon and one at five.
I'm looking forward to watching the games on Sunday afternoon with family.
We have NFL ticket so we catch all of the games.
I think the Saints will be tough this year.
I agree, I love Brees and Sean Peyton is a great coach.
I think they will be tough, they picked up Adrian Peterson, he'll be good in a rotation with Ingram.
My sleeper team is the Packers this year.
They do have Rodgers!
Besides Rodgers, they have great receivers and their defense is underated.
I'm thinking the Giants will surprise this year.
They have one of the best defenses in the league.
In addition, they added Marshall which will open that offense up.
He's a huge addition.
Eli Manning's been there before - he knows how to win.
I love teams with great defenses.  They always seem to do well in the playoffs.
They are a little sketchy on running back with Perkins.
Who needs to run when you have OBJ and Marshall...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
You better believe it!  Who is your team?
America's team!
Hahaha. You can't mean the Dallas Cowboys?
Yes, the Dallas Cowboys!  They have won 5 Superbowls!
Not in this century!  My team is the New England Patriots.
The Patriots?  They are nothing without Tom Brady!
Well the Patriots have Garoppolo as a backup!
Garoppolo is garbage!  If he becomes starting quarterback the Patriots win no more Superbowls.  I doubt they even go 8-8 with Garoppolo.
Garoppolo will proof you wrong.He has a QB rating of 113.3.
Now if you want to talk about a run for the Superbowl lets talk the Cowboys.
Cowboys?  Are they bringing back Aikman or Staubach?
That's funny!  But we did get 5 Superbowl wins with them.
True but that was back in the VCR era.
Well the Cowboys are a true team and not a one hit wonder.
Tom Brady has 5 Superbowl wins.  That is hardy a one hit wonder.
Whatever!  The Cowboys will prove they are America's team with Dak Prescott.
Prescott is a kid that has not done anything yet.
Well the Cowboys went 13-3 last year under his leadership.
And lost to the Packers!  Prescott still has to prove himself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are the Chiefs going go to repeat as AfC West Champs?
Heck yeah, the only competition for them is the Raiders.
What's  Jeremey Machlin going to do in Baltimore
I dont know. He'll be good, but he won't put up Steve Smith numbers.
I wonder how long it will be before Mahonnes replaces Alex Smith.
I know! I'd love to see Smith ball out knowing this year is it for him.
For real! I think we can make it to the Superbowl!
Just get it to Tyreek Hill and he's gone!
I love that bad man!!! I ain't worried about them Raiders either. We own them.
Indeed! Did you see how much they paid Carr?!?!
They ain't changed. Man do a little bit, they pay him a lot.
Marshawn Lynch worries me a little bit, but they ain't smart enough to feed him once we get the lead.
We play them in prime time right?
You know it. And we got Dallas in week 11 I think.
Thats right! That's going to be the first Cowboys game that Romo calls!
I wonder who he'll be pulling for!
Hahaha! You know us! KC!!!
I was scared of the rumors of him coming to us!
Me too. I'm glad he didnt. I'm glad he didn't go to Denver either!
He's in the best place for himself. I'm anxious to hear him call some games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever thought about where NFL teams got their names?
Not too much but some have interesting names.
The Atlanta Falcons solicited team names from fans to pick its name. Now it has the nickname dirty birds too.
Do you know how the Browns got their name?
They were named after their first coach Paul Brown.
That is quite an honor. The Cincinatti Bengals were almost named the Buckeyes.
I did not know that. The original Browns franchise moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens.
The Ravens were named after the Edgar Allen Poe poem.
Most NFL team names were chosen based on fan submissions.
They built fan loyalty from the start.
The Buffalo Bills name was picked from a fan contest.
Were they named after Buffalo Bill? The cowboy?
Yes they were! Pretty cool name huh?
That is a good name.
The Chicago Bears name was based on their baseball team the Chicago Cubs.
That is true. Both teams played at Wrigley Field when the franchise first started.
The Detroit Lions were originally called the Spartans.
Maybe they should have kept that name. They may have won more games.
You have jokes!
I like some laughs with my football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, there are a few teams that just seem to be bordering falling off.
Yea, Seattle may be one and Green Bay may be another.
Yea, I agree, but Denver has to be at the top of the list.
Yea, what are they doing?
Well, it seems like they have spent a lot of money on their defense.
Nothing on their offense though.
No, they literally have very few playmakers there.
Yea, who follows up a superbowl with a 7th round rookie QB?
Yea, I do not know how they thought that could have worked.
That could have been a distaster.
Yea, they are lucky he turned out okay, but still not good enough.
Yea, it was too bad that they couldn't build on that success.
Well, when you go from a hall of fame quarterback to a scrub, stuff like that tends to happen.
I agree. The defense just couldn't carry them enough.
Yea, the defense can only do so much.
Yea, they were living proof of that this year.
They sure were and it didn't work out to well for them.
Yea, maybe this year will be better.
I do not know. They still don't have a quarterback.
You're right. It might take a couple years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am ready for some NFL football to return!
Me too, thankfully pre-season is right around the corner.
Who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Detriot Lions.
How did the Lions do last year.
The lions had a decent year and won 9 games.
Did they make the playoffs?
The lions lost the wildcard game and got put out of the playoffs.
Oh, thats a shame.  We always watch them on thanksgiving day for tradition.
We are hoping for a year like we had back in the day.
When did the Lions have a great team.
Oh, in the 1950's, the Lions were the dominat team in the NFL.
Wow, I didn't know that.
Led by quarterback Layne, the Lions won sever NFL champoinships in the 1950's.
Who is their quarterback now?
The Lions are led by Stafford who averages over 4000 passing yards a season.
Stafford seems really good, where did he play in college?
He had a great college career at Georgia and was a stand out player.
He is one of only 4 players to throw for over 5000 yards in a season!
It sounds like the Detriot lions have a great quarterback!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the hardest position in the NFL?
I think field goal kicking would be hard.
That is true.
The skill is not the hardest.
No it is not.
But the pressure they face would be overwhelming.
Agreed.
What do you think is the hardest position.
I think quarter back.
That is a typical pick.
Think about the quarter backs in the league.  They have to be smart and athletic.
Yeah.  The Rogers and Brady's of the world are both.
Think about Russel Wilson.  Very smart and very athletic.
That is true.
It takes a special type of person to play that position.
It does.
Probably why they are paid so well.
It is a little outrageous what they make.
But it is fun to watch them compete.
Best sport in the world to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you going to the game this weekend?
Of course.
Shall we bring the grill and make a day out of it?
I would to but I can't.
Why not?
Bringing the wife and kids, they're not for standing in the cold parking lot all morning.
They can stand around the grill!
Nope, I already asked her.
Fine, I'll see if anybody else wants to tailgate.  At least swing by a little early.
That I can do.  What time is kick off.
one o'clock!
Ok, you wearing your cheesehead this game.
only if you are!
Sounds like a plan.
Get any cheese heads for the kids.
I wish they want terrible towels.
No way?
Yes way!
My condolences.
Right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Steelers and Redskins?
No, I didn't. What was the final score?
The Steelers beat the Redskins, 38-16
How many passing yards did Roethlisberger have?
Roethlisberger had 300 yards.
How many passing yards did Cousins have?
Cousins had a lot of yards with a total of 329.
Did Roethlisberger have any interceptions?
Yes, but it was only 1.
What about Cousins? Did he have any interceptions?
Yes, Cousins had 2 interceptions.
How many rushing yards did the Steelers have?
The Steelers had 147 total rushing yards?
How many rushing yards did the Redskins have?
The Redskins only had 55 rushing yards?
How many times did the Steelers punt the football?
The Steelers had to make 2 punts.
How many fumbles did the Steelers make?
The Steelers made 2 total fumbles.
Okay, I'll try to watch the highlights later on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the redskins will shape up this year?
I'm not sure.
They seemed to get more athletic in the draft.
Who did they draft?
Jonathan Allen was number one.
They were lucky he was there at seventeen.
Yes,and,they addded his,Alabama teammate Ryan Anderson.
He would give them insurance on the edge.
Didn't they draft a corner too.
Yes,Fabian Moreau.
Right,from ucla.
Yes,that's right.
Do you think they can win with Kirk cousins at qb?
He can be good.
Yes,but he can be bad too.
He's got a good receiver in terrelle Pryor.
Yes he does.
Jamison crowder is growing as a target.
He's coming into his third year right?
Yes he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think is going to the Super Bowl this year?
Anyone but the Patriots, I hope!
Me too! I'm sick to death of them.
Yeah, plus they cheat constantly and lie about everything.
I'd like to see some new teams get there.
I don't know. Look at the last two NEW teams. Panthers and Falcons. Panthers were awful and Falcons were worse.
That's true but the Falcons played a great first half.
Yes, but look at the second half. That was the worst meltdown we've ever seen in a Super Bowl.
How about the Cowboys? They should stand a chance.
They have a serious chance but I hope not. I can't stand them.
But they're America's team!!
Only in their heads.
Okay, how about the Redskins?
I like the Washington Redskins. I like Kirk Cousins and I'd like to see him do well.
I'm not much of a Redskins fan.
I like the NY Giants better. I like Eli Manning and a few of the other players.
Eli's pretty good. He might have another SB win in him.
I hope so. I'm partial to the Mannings.
I think Houston might have a good chance.
I agree with you. They had a monster defense last year. It will only be better with JJ Watt coming back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the upcoming season?
Yes of course, are you?
I prefer the playoffs.
Yes that is the most intense gameplay.
Yes that is my favorite time of year.
Yes the players really step up then.
Yes they players play harder in the playoffs.
Yes I notice that too.
That is why I want to watch every second of every game in the playoffs.
Do you feel that way about the regular season?
I would like to watch every game, but it is ok if I only watch my favorite teams and players.
Yes I understand what you are saying.
Yes the regular season is good, but the playoffs are better.
I agree wholeheartedly.
Yes but I still enjoy the regular season.
Yes it is great.
It is, but not as great as the playoffs.
Yes you said it well.
I am looking forward to next season.
Yes, I am also looking forward to then, especially the playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
ave you ever gone to a football game in Philadelphia?
Yes. It was an experience.
I know. The Eagles fans are crazy.
Yeah, but I guess fans for all teams get nuts.
Yes, but some of them get mean.
They think their team is unbeatable.
Too bad they haven't had such great seasons.
They did have some real good players.
Donovan McNabb was a good one.
They retired his number.
I didn't know that.
Reggie White too.
That one I knew.
What's the name of their field?
I beileve it's the Lincoln Financial Field.
Did they just remodel that?
I'm not sure.
Their logo sure has improved over the years.
Yeah it has.
The Eagle from the early seventies was odd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite football player?
Currently or ever?
At any time.
Well, for many years when i was asked that it was Martine Grammatica.
He was a kicker?
Yes, for the bucs like 15 or so years ago.
What did you like about him?
Well, he was like 5 foot 3 and use to plant that field goal every time.
Seriously?
Yes, they use to call him "Automatica"
No way. That was cool.
Yeah, his family was all kickers like in football and soccer.
Right on.
Yeah, it was odd when he left football.
How so?
Well, he just had a perfect season and he lissed like 2 field goals halfway thru the season and they just swapped him out.
That's very strange.
I agree. i never looked into it but it always bothered me.
No doubt.
Someday i'll read up on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite football team?
the raiders is my favorite.
why do you like them so much?
cause they are from fl.
is that where you are from?
yes.
tell me something interesting about them.
i honestly dont know much.
how are they your favorite team then.
i used to drive by their stadium everyday.
where was this at?
in tampa, where i lived.
how did that make you like them?
i dont know, it just awed me how they could put a stadium in the middle of a city.
is it big?
yes, pretty big.
do you miss florida?
i miss it a lot.
would you ever go back?
i would love to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember who played in the first Super Bowl?
Yeah, I think it was the Green Bay Packers.
And who else?
The Kansas City Chiefs I believe.
That's right. Classic match up.
Yeah, the Packers won as well.
Yeah, Vince Lombardi was the coach.
Oh yeah, legendary coach.
Yep, named the Super Bowl trophy after him.
Do you remember what year that took place.
I believe it was 1967.
Do you know where it took place.
The L.A. Coliseum.
Wow, that place is old. They'd never have one there now.
Yeah, it's definitely dated.
But not too dated for the L.A. Rams.
Yeah, I guess they're still playing there until they have a new stadium.
Do you remember when the Raiders played there?
Yeah, that was a while back.
Yeah, but it was awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles?
Absolutely. Lived in Philly for some of my childhood.
Right in Philly?
Well, in the suburbs. Valley Forge.
I hear Eagle fans are ruthless.
Yeah, we once booed a guy dressed as Santa during a game.
Have the Eagles ever won a Super Bowl?
No, but they won some NFL championships prior to the Super Bowl.
What years?
I don't recall the exact years. Sometime way back in the 40s and 60s.
Oh so it's been awhile since they've won something.
Yeah, we made the Super Bowl in 2004, but lost.
Who won that year?
The Patriots. One of their first wins. It was horrible.
Was it a close game?
Yes, lost by 3.
Oh man, that must've been devastating to watch.
It was. Still gives me nightmares.
Well there's always hope every year.
Yes there is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL season is in two months.
Technically a month if you include preseason
That's true. I'm even more excited then.
It usually isn't that fun to watch, but I'll take anything
Yeah, I'll watch all of the games for my team regardless.
It's cool to see who makes it and doesn't after all the cuts.
Who is your team by the way?
I'm a Browns fan.
I feel your pain as I am a Jets fan.
We can yell at our televisions together.
How are you feeling about the Browns this season
I am not really expecting too much, but our draft was pretty solid and we didn't reach this time.
Yeah, I saw they took an entirely different approach.
We got a long way to go, but that is the right way to build a team.
The Jets definitely are going to be a bottom three team this year.
It's a shame, because they were just in the AFC Title game two consecutive years in a row with Sanchez at the helm.
We had such a good looking team, despite a mediocre quarterback and the wheels just fell off suddenly
Our wheels have seemed to have been off for some time now in regard to the Browns.
I am getting stoked just thinking about the season, despite the likely outcome
So am I! Is it opening season yet?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hank Williams is singing the intro to NFL Monday night football again!
That's cool, he did a great job before.
Just a few more months and football is back.  I'm so excited!
Me too!
Are you going to any Vikings games this year?
I might, but I have to work a lot of the time on Sundays.
Maybe they will have a Monday night game.
That would be great.
I'll be heading to Seattle in October to watch the Seahawks.
That's awesome.  Their stadium looks so cool.
Yes they are the loudes venue in the NFL.
The 12th man!
That giant Viking horn at the Vikings Stadium gets the crowd going.
I know it is so loud in their new stadium.
Do you think Bridgewater will be back this season?
I hope so, but his injury sounded pretty serious last year.
I heard that it was bad, but he at least has the best doctors around him.
Yes they should be able to either get him healthy or tell him his career is over.
Let's hope he gets to play he was looking good the season before he got hurt.
I know, and if not I think Sam Bradford is still there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the rising star in the AFC East division?
That's a tough one! But I'm going for Trey Flowers.
Why do you say that?
Flowers started the final eight games of the regular season, finishing with seven sacks.
True, and he capped his year with a key sack of Matt Ryan in the Super Bowl that pushed the Falcons out of field goal range, likely saving the Patriots' comeback bid.
Exactly. Flowers has a long way to go until he is considered in the same company as Khalil Mack or Von Miller, but his arrow is pointing up.
I agree. I think DeVante Parker would be my pick.
He is definitely up there. What's your reason?
Parker was one of Miami's best players in spring practices, and was hard to defend and made various big plays.
True. I expect Parker to surpass 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career and have the type of breakout season the Dolphins have been waiting for.
That would be something! I really hope he does.
What about the Jets defensive lineman, Leonard Williams?
Isn't he already a star?
Yea, but I still think he's on the rise.
What makes you say that?
He's only 23 and hasn't reached his ceiling yet. Scary, right?
Right. He has had two good years, but he's still learning the nuances of the position.
His defensive line coach certainly agrees and believes in Williams.
That's awesome. Williams is improving as a pass-rusher and said his goal is at least 10 sacks and to make the Pro Bowl.
I sure hope so,  he made seven sacks last year and was a Pro Bowl replacement.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, you think they're gonna pay Leveon Bell a lot this year?
I think they will, he's gotta be the best runningback in the league!
You don't think David Johnson is?
The Cardinals guy? I don't know much about him.
Exactly, the NFL doesn't showcase stars that aren't in prime viewing areas.
So why's he so good?
Well he led the league in all-purpose yards last year.
I thought Ezekiel Elliot did.
Exactly, that's all the NFL cares to talk about is the Cowboys.
Well ok then, so who is better, David or LeVeon.
Honestly it's a toss up, I think the kicker is the fact that Bell is going to miss games.
Like he did at the start of the 2016 season?
Right, the guy has a history of either getting in trouble, or getting hurt.  Neither of which I'm too fond of.
What is marijuana that he got suspended for at the start of the season?
Yeah, and I don't think Johnson has missed a game yet.
Isn't he young though?
Yeah, but I think that just adds to his attractiveness.
Where did Bell play in college, it feels like so long ago?
I'm pretty sure it was Michigan State.
Yeah, he was good then, but I never would have guessed this good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team are you rooting for in the upcoming football season?
I am a lifelong Denver Broncos fan so I will be rooting for them even though they were mediocre last year.
I remember they won the Super Bowl a couple years ago, so what happened to them?
Peyton Manning retired and they had an inexperienced quarterback take over named Trevor Siemian.
It really shows how much of an impact a quarterback can make on the whole team. Just look at Tom Brady's impact on the Patriots.
That is true. I had a feeling they were going to win the Super Bowl even when they were down by 25 points. Tom Brady just never lets his team give up.
That was an unbelievable Super Bowl. I'm still mad at how Atlanta's offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan blew the game near the end!
Now Kyle is coaching the San Francisco 49ers this year. It will be interesting to see how well they do.
Who is the 49ers quarterback this year?
I think it is Brian Hoyer. It's amazing how Colin Kaepernick isn't even playing on any team this year when he used to be quite the player.
Players in the NFL definitely have a very short playing career. That's what makes the longevity of Tom Brady particularly amazing.
Speaking of that, I can't believe Tony Romo is retiring to be an announcer. I was hoping he would join the Broncos instead.
Dak Prescott really had an amazing year out of nowhere last year for the Cowboys. And Dak is a great football name, too.
That is what makes the NFL exciting, teams are always changing and you never know what can happen unlike other sports where the same team dominates for year after year.
It will also be interesting to see how the Raiders do in Las Vegas.
Vegas is a crazy city for having football games. I think the best fans are in cities like Buffalo or Green Bay where there is really no other entertainment.
That's true, you do tend to get the most die-hard fans in those type of cities.
It would be funny if they allowed open gambling in the stadium during the Raiders' home games.
Surprisingly the Raiders are being considered to have a pretty good chance to win this year's Super Bowl.
Interesting, I did see their quarterback Derek Carr just got a big contract. I hope it is another exciting year in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the other player that won 5 superbowls?
Charles Haley
I don't even klnow who that is
He was a linebacker and defensive end. Played for the 49ers and the cowboys.
Huh. And he won superbowl with 2 different teams?
yep, twice with the 49ers, and 3 times with the cowboys
i wonder how common that is? Winning the superbowl playing for multipl,e teams.
Not common. Peyton Manning is the very first QB to win the superbowl playing for two different teams.
That kinda makes sense, the reason for trade is because your performance goes down
Yeah. There have been other QBs who went to the superbowl playing for more than one team, however.
Like who?
Kurt Warner and Craig Morton. Morton didn't win any, while Warner won 1.
They should keep track of all the players who do that, not just QBs. Like in a database.
That database would be cool to have.
My point exactly.
WEll at least we have the info for the QBs, and that's better than nothing.
Brady went to the superbowl 7 times!
And won 5.
So he went to the superbowl more than anyone. and won the superbowl more than anyone
Yep, but he also lost 2, so his percentage of winning the superbowl isn't as high as Bradshaw or Montana who both went to the superbowl 4 times and won all 4.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ugg,it is almost fall.
Yea so?
Football Season..
Wow that is right, that is great.
Really?? I hate football season.
Wow, I never heard anyone say that before.
Well, I do. I find the game monotonous.
I think football is exciting. The Cowboys are my favorite team.
I do not have a favorite team but it I did it would be the Eagles I guess.
Why don't you like it?
It is long. My husband sits his butt in front of the tv all Sunday afternoon and it is so boring.
Well he likes it , right
Yea, but I don't.
Do you watch it with him.
Absolutely not. It is a big waste of my time.
So what do you do then?
Anything but watch football.
Do his friends come over?
Sometimes and then I get stuck cooking.
Sounds like fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what is your favorite football team?
The Giants!  How about you?
The colts!  How do you think Eli will do this year?
I think he will maybe win 8 or 9 games but won't go to the playoffs.
The colts will definitely win the division this year don't you think?
I'm not sure, he has been struggling in recent years.  Bring back Payton!
Do you think Eli is better than Payton?
The rings make them both equal, though Eli won his with one team.  I think Payton was overrated.
He certainly was successful with the Colts as far as winning divisions, but it only translated into one Super Bowl win.  What year did Eli win?
2007, right after Payton won his.  Have you ever been to a game?
I saw the Colts play the Patriots in Foxboro in 2010.  The Colts got plastered by like 30.  Have you?
I've never seen an NFL game.  Isn't it expensive?
I got my ticket through my work, and it cost me $300 for bus, tickets and food.
I can afford that!  How was the food?
It was great tailgating food.  I ate so much.  We had to bring our own alcohol though.
Of course.  Is your job running any more trips?
Not for the colts or the Giants.  Have you always been a Giants fan?
My whole life.  How long have you liked the Colts?
E
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Colin Kaepernick will get picked up?
I do not think that he will. Which owner will want him?
The Cowboys of a history of picking up troubled players.
Do you really think that Colin Kaepernick is a troubled player?
Not in the traditional sense of troubled players, but he did create a stir in the league.
Yes, but the stir was about a positive message.
I think so to, but it did not look good for the NFL and they didn't do a good job at explaining it.
But Colin put his money where his mouth was and made some great donations.
I agree with that andthe NFL should have come out and matched those donations.
Why should have the NFL matched those donations?
It would have shown support to their players and the bigger social issues in society.
Yes, but they do not need to do that.
They do not need to and they didn't, but I think they would have looked better as an organization.
That is true, and I think it would have made the NFL being a nonprofit make more sense as well.
Agreed. They make billions and they really do not provide a public service
You do not think that what they do is a public service?
No, they provide entertainment.
Yes, they provide entertainment and their brand is suffering.
The entertainment is still good. If you like the teams that do well
I do not think it depends on the teams that are doing well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for this year's NFL season to start?
Yes! Although, I'm sure that my team is already out of contention
Which team?
I'm a die-hard Chicago Bears fan.
Last year was definitely not their year.
I know. We're a long way from their 1985 championship.
Well, they had a lot of injuries last year. Maybe they'll turn it around this year.
Yeah, maybe. Who are you rooting for?
I'm a big fan of the Dallas Cowboys
Prescott did great last year, but too bad we didn't get to see much of Tony Romo. I've always liked him.
Well, he's retired now, so it's onwards towards a Superbowl ring
I have to admit, the Cowboys here phenomenal last year.
It isn't often that a team sends two rookies to the Pro Bowl
We'll, they sure deserved it. Especially Ezekiel Elliott for breaking Tony Dorsett's rushing record
How they didn't make the Superbowl last year, I'll never know
The lost to the Green Bay Packers, a wild card team. How did that even happen?
The Cowboys lost by a field goal. That was a sad day.
And then the Falcons stomped the Packers. Poetic justice.
Yeah. Well, it's going to be our year this year. Just you wait and see.
Good luck to you. Me, I'm still rooting for my Chicago Bears.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, what happened to the Panthers last year?
I don't know, but man, they were bad.
They were so feared in 2015.
Yeah, they looked like Super Bowl champs for sure.
Well, Denver ended that train of thought.
Yeah, that was a total blowout.  Not what I expected.
Cam Newton is a bit overrated.
He had a down year for sure, but he was the MVP.
Was is the key word.  Not anymore and not even the best QB in the division.
They don't use him very well.
They should have him running the ball ten times a game.  You can't stop him.
He's a load to bring down.  I think they are worried about injury though.
I get that, but play to your strengths.
But you can't utilize your strengths with a broken leg.
Speaking of which, didn't that happen to their linebacker?
You mean Luke Kuechly?
Yeah, that's who I'm thinking of.
I thought he got knocked because of concussions.
I thought he had both or something.
It was a tough year for him.  When healthy, he's a top 5 defensive player for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you ready for football season
Sure cant wait.
Do you know what teams have the most Superbowl wins?
I am pretty sure the Pittsburgh Steelers have 6 Superbowl wins.
Then whos after them?
The Patriots and the Cowboys each have 5 Superbowl wins.
So no team has won more then six.
No  and 13 franchises have not even won a Superbowl.
Really i had no clue i thought they had all one at least one.
No and your husbands favorite team the Saints have only won one Superbowl.
Well that is because Dree Brees is their Quarter back.
I agree he is not as good as he used to be.
So theres a few teams that if they win one more Superbowl they will tie with the Steelers.
Now i understand better.
We need to get tickets so we can take our hubbys to the game.
Thats a great idea for his birthday present.
Lets look up and see if the NFL schdule is up yet.
Great idea.
I assume he would like to stay down south since he hates the cold
Yes that means no at home games for the Steelers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you own a lot of NFL apparel?
I own quite a few.
What teams gear do you own?
I own some Bears things.
I own Bears pajama pants.
I own some COlts jerseys.
I own alot of them too.
I have alot of championship shirts.
I have a lot of Patriot gear.
That I do not have,
I think some things are expensive.
I agree.
If you go in the NFL shop sometimes you can catch the gear on clearance.
Yeah I have never though about doing that.
They also sell it in alot of stores.
That is were I get most of mine.
I usually go to walmart.
Also at campus stores they sell NFL.
I will have to check it out.
Yeah they have different there or the teams website directly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The football is almost back.
Great, at last!
Our team needs some work.
You think so? I though they were all right.
They won't get in unless they sign somebody.
You can't make the playoffs every year.
Especially when you play Atlanta and Dallas twice.
They do all right at home.
I don't know; did you see that Super Bowl?
Well the New England defense came out soft.
Yeah, but that quarterback has no conscience.
He is good.
We don't play them until week five, so that is something.
I hope Dallas falls off.
Wouldn't bet on it.
With our receivers, we are in any game.
Hey, don't they have to play in Paris this year?
You mean London! I hope not.
At least the game is on at 9 AM.
Kind of too early, don't you think?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the NFL season should be longer?
You mean with more games?
Yeah. I think the NFL season is too short.
I think it's just about right. I don't think they can really play too many games.
Why do you say that?
Football is really taxing on the body. That's why most games have a week between them for recovery.
I think that since football players are getting paid so much money, they should play more games in a season. Plus it's more money for the league.
I personally think that there would be more injuries if footall players had to play more than 16 games.
Not really. I mean, do you see players who go deep into the playoffs getting injured more than those who get eliminated in the regular season?
I don't really know. But imagine players who go into the playoffs having to play extra games during the regular season.
I think that it wouldn't matter. I think they could do something where they have more rest time between a few games.
I guess that could work. But I personally see it being a problem with the players.
Of course it would be a problem with them. They want to make as much money without working more for it.
Do you blame them? Would you want to make the same amount of money for more work?
If I was making millions of dollars, I woudn't mind. Wouldn't you like to see the season start earlier since there isn't really much sports.Y
I wouldn't mind. But I also wouldn't want players getting injured because they are playing too much.
I just want to see more football. I think it would also give some teams more chances to get over injuries early in the season.
I think there's some pros and cons to having a longer season.
I definitely think the NFL should consider it since it means more revenue.
I would definitely watch all the games though if they did add more games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope the NFL doesnt make anymore rule changes or new ones.
Me either, it's gotten silly lately.
If it gets any worse it will be like Flag Football.
I thought it was silly that players cant do a shimmy after a touchdown.
Or slam the ball.
Yeah, it's getting crazy.
Between that and the concussions.
Yeah, the no helmets clicking rule.
You cant always control that, it's silly.
Serious, any play can have helmet contact.
It's too bad we can petition the comittee for rule changes.
Yeah, but the rules now are "for the better"
They are doing the same with Boxing,
Next you will have to wear a helmet for golfing.
Or safety gear for Bowling.
I fear it will only get worse.
I guess time will tell.
Yeah.
I do like your idea about petitioning the NFL Comittee.
I wonder how we go about doing that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi! Are you excited for the next Green Bay Packers season??
You know it! I can't wait! Do you have access to your dad's season tickets again this year?
I do, are you interested in going to a game!
I definitely would be. I can't wait to see what Rodgers can do this season. How do you think the season will start?
Hopefully we get 'em right out of the gate & it's not like last season. What game would you be interested in going to?
I'd love to see the Packers play the Vikings - what a rivalry! Do you think I can get tickets to that game?
I'll check and see. You like a good rivalry, maybe you'd want to see the Packers and Bears play -- would that be okay for a backup game?
For sure! That'd be cool. Do you think that's the better battle?
Yeah, I'd pick a game between the Packers and Bears any time - but maybe it's because I'm from Chicago. Where are you from again?
I grew up in Minneapolis! I am a Packer fan and got a lot of heck for it as a kid growing up in Minnesota.
I bet you did! That must have been tough. What was the worse thing someone said to you?
Actually, people have always been really nice. Do you go around talking smack to someone wearing something other than a Packers' jersey?
Well, no... but my mom went to a game once at Lambeau with her Bears shirt on and people were really rude to her.
In Lambeau? They have some of the most welcoming fans in the league!
I know, I was surprised too. She probably won't be going back there again.
Good news for me, so that I can get a chance at another set of tickets. :)
Definitely. If you got them, who would you take with you?
You, friend! That'd be so fun.
I don't want to go, bring someone else.
That'd be fine too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you like to see the current passing rules revised?
Yes I think the catch rule should be modified.
In what sense?
It should be based on common sense from the ref
I think you are on to something
Other sports incorporate that kind of rule.
Yeah its too hard to decipher what a catch is.
In addition I would like to see pass interference changed
How so?
I think it should be loosened a bit.
Yeah it would help with aggressive cornerbacks
Its becoming laughable.
Its tougher to have a good defense anymore.
Yeah and thats the way the NFL wants it to be honest
You dont want the 5 yard rule revised, right?
I would extend it to 10 yards.
That would decrease scoring.
Put more emphasis on the running game as well.
Yeah the NFL wants alot of touchdowns
With little to no celebrating
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you think the New York Giants will be good this year?
Well, their first game of the season is against the Dallas Cowboys.
Oh, will the game be in New York or Dallas?
The game will be played in Dallas.
What is the date of that first game of the season?
The game will be played on Sunday, September 10th.
What time are they playing?
The game starts at 8:30pm in Dallas.
The Giants' offensive power might be too much for the Cowboys to handle.
That may be true, but Dak Prescot will make it a great game.
Eli Manning has a lot of targets to throw the ball to.
You make a good point there.
Who are the Giants playing after that game?
The Giants are playing the Detroit Lions.
My money is on the Giants in that game.
I will have to agree with you, but then they play the Eagles.
The Giants have my vote in that game too.
Yeah, the toughest game out of those three for the Giants will be Dallas.
Yes, I can't wait for pro football to start!
Me either, preseason starts in a few weeks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You think Kaepernick will find a team?
No. He's getting blackballed.
You think?
I do. I mean look at all the other teams with bad quarterbacks.
Sure but some are rookies or have a lot of sunk cost.
You don't think Kaep can be a backup?
Maybe.
Who's backup in New York?
Uhh...
Geno Smith. Is Kaep better than Geno Smith?
I'd say so, yeah.
And he'd be a great backup to Wilson in Seattle.
They signed McCown, right?
Who is terrible, and doesn't have the same game as Kaep.
Which is similar to Wilson's.
Right. And Kaep's jersey sold like crazy last year.
So I guess he wouldn't be a financial liability.
Right. People will buy his jersey no matter what.
Like Tebow.
Kaep is waaaay better than Tebow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite team?
Yup, mine is the Packers.
Oh, you are a cheese head! Mine is the Cardinals.
They are not bad, you in AZ?
Used to be, now in Nashville.
Titan's done okay last season.
Yup, hopefully the QB will stay healthy. He's still young though.
What about Card's QB?
Yeah, I am a bit concerned. Palmer is getting old and we will need a new QB...and Wide receiver, too.
Fitzgerald is still playing right?
I think this may be his last season. We do have a great Running back.
Oh, yeah. What's his name?
David Johnson.
He's new?
Kinda, he is young and really good.
That's good.
How do you think Packers will do this season?
I think they will do good.
I don't care as long as Steelers and Patriots don't win.
I second that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! do you think Brett Favre is a good influence for Aaron Rodgers?
Definitely, Brett is a great mentor for Aaron Rodgers.
You think so? I really doubt that, since they have different style of play.
Probably, but Brett Favre is one of the few remaining veterans that are still in the league.
What if Aaron Rodgers does not need Brett Favre, do you think he's too old to be mentoring in the league right now?
I think Aaron needs some of the ropes that Brett Favre can bring and offer, and no, Favre is one of the few veterans that are still relevant.
I still think that the pairing is a bit flawed because of their individual style of play.
It's true but I think they can adjust pretty well.
Although, Favre is a champion though so I guess that would very much help in a sense.
Greatly, but so is Rodgers, you would need a mentor who is already a champion, not just a player who have been in the league for quite a while.
How about this, if things would workout, would they (Packers) have a chance in the superbowl?
Definitely, since this past season they did great.
Really? I think they have underperformed.
I disagree, I think the Packers were only a bit unlucky in most of their games.
Well if you put it that way, they don't deserve to be in the Superbowl if luck is their concern.
I'm just saying that they were games last season that they had a great chance of winning, yet they came up short.
I somewhat agree, that's where Favre needs to focus on mentoring Aaron Rodgers.
Right, he should be more mental instead of changing how Aaron plays.
Agree, I really hope Aaron Rodgers would click with Brett Favre and win the Superbowl again.
I would really think so and there is a great chance they can do it, let's just be patient.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Superbowl last year?
Yes.  The Patriots and Falcons.
That was a pretty good game.
It was.
Usually the Superbowl is not a very close game.
Not true of that one.
I thought Atlanta was going to win.
So did I.
I was rooting for Atlanta.
I was rooting against the Patriots.
Why is that?
I war mostly rooting against Tom Brady.
Because of the whole deflate gate?
No.
Another reason?
I just don't care for his personality.
He does act childish at times.
Yes he does.
I would like to see them not do so well this year.
I am right there with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here we go Steelers!  Here we go.
LOL.  They got mowed down by New England.
Yeah they did.  Too many turnovers.
Also too many field goals versus touchdowns.
Yep.  The key is staying healthy.
That is the key for every team.
Rothlesburger was hurt last year.
He seems to get hurt almost every year.
Yeah he does.  He almost retired.
I saw that.  Steelers have no chance if he isn't their QB.
Yeah.  Landry Jones is their backup.
I saw they drafted a QB in the draft this year.
I saw that too.  I forget who.
Some guy out of Tennessee I think.
Bell has to stay healthy.
He might be the best running back in the game.
And Brown might be the 2nd best receiver in the game next to Odell Beckem.
True. They have an explosive offense.
They have to keep Pouncy healthy as he seems to get hurt a lot too.
Yeah, QB's get all the attention, but in my opinion the offensive line is the most important roster position.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really confused about the NFL and its TV schedule.
How so?
Well, they have one Monday Night matchup and all-day Sunday.
Right...
But why do they need Thursday?
Maybe they feel threatened by college, or other TV shows that in no way affect them.
I also don't like that on Sundays, there's only ever two games on at once.
Yeah, they only have deals with the NFL network, CBS, Fox, and NBC.
I don't even get the NFL network.
Yeah, they just will do anything for money.
In college there's always like eight games on at once so you have a legitimate choice
Right, but this is the NFL. The commissioner would never have it.
It's really all about the money isn't it?
Yup. I rarely can watch a game anyway because my team gets blacked out a lot.
I wish the NFL network would be available everywhere, and you could choose what game you wanted at any time.
Me too. Too bad logic doesn't make money.
Too bad they pay their players millions of dollars each, thus necessitating it.
It's a bit extravagant.
I'm just hoping they don't go to Wednesdays or Tuesdays.
Me too; it's too excessive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard you're into football. Who's your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowboys.
Oh yeah, they're pretty popular and also pretty hated.
I know, it seems like with football fans there is no in-between on them.
I've just recently become a fan and I don't have a favorite team yet, but I really love the game.
It's great because of the athletic ability and speed of the players.
I'll probably decide on a favorite team before the season begins. Do you have any tips for that?
Well, I think you should make your own choice. Think about the teams you're drawn to and the qualities you like in a team.
I have a friend who is a big Raider fan and we watched a lot of their games last year.
They're very popular because they have a great history of success and right now they're an up and coming team.
They have some players I really like to watch like Khalil Mack, Amari Cooper and Derek Carr.
They re very good players. Carr should come back strong from his injury.
I'm really thinking about adopting them. My wife is from Tampa and I have also gravitated toward the Buccaneers because of that.
That's another up and coming team with good young players like Jameis Winston and Mike Evans.
They narrowly missed the playoffs last year and I think they have a good chance this year.
They do because they've added some good veterans and some good talent in the draft.
But then there's one other team I like, which is the Indianapolis Colts.
They're kind of floundering the last couple of years. They have some talent but are deficient in lots of areas.
What I really like about them is their uniforms. I've always loved horses, so I like the horseshoe on the helmet.
That's fine too, people have lots of different reasons for choosing a team. They are interesting to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best NFL franchise?
That's a tough one.  Who's your favorite?
I would say the Patriots.
They have been good for the last few years, but not all time.
So who do you pick?
I would go with the Steelers.
They are always a good team.
That's why I would say they are the best franchise.
Did you know the Steelers have only had 3 coaches since 1969?
Yeah, Chuck Noll, Bill Cower, and Mike Tomlin.
That is super rare for a franchise to have a coach that long.
I would also say the Cowboys are an all time great franchise.
The Cowboys haven't been good for years.
The Cowboys are good but they are not Super Bowl good.
I guess that is fair.
I would say for the history of the NFL it's got to be the Steelers.
How many championships have the Steelers won?
The Steelers have won 6 Super Bowls.
Who's won the most Super Bowls as a team?
It's the Steelers with 6.  The Patriots have 5.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Past or present, who would be your dream NFL team be made of?
1993 Dallas running back Jerry Rice and Titans 1999 Eddie george to start.
WHo would you want for quarterback?
Joe Montana, from when he was with the 49ers.
Really? I would have picked Peyton Manning when he was with the colts.
I never really liked Peyton Manning.
Really? why?
I always thought as good as Tennessee was to him, he should have spent some time there after the colts drafted him.
I think he would do great as a head coach at UT.
Maybe so, but he always semed like a legacy that acted entitled and I never felt like his team was loyal to him.
But how can you ignore his skill and record?
I am not, I just think that to ask your team to protect you and lay your body on the line, the loyalty factor  would have went a long way.
Ok I am not following you, do you have an example?
Sure, look at the 1990's Dallas cowboys, Aikman and rice where they dynamic duo.
ok so you would pick Manning because he is more a one man show?
I guess so, yes.
Who who you want on your defense?
The entire 2017 Falcons line up.
who would be the offense?
The 1985 Bears
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Saints will do this year?
I think they can catch Atlanta this year
Really? Didn't have them that high...
The defense is on the rebound.
Well, it can't get any worse...
Yeah, they let the defense down last year.
They gave up a lot of points last year
Way too many points..it was ridiculous
Well Drew Brees definitely has some weapons
Yup. Michael Thomas surprised me last year
Yeah...didn't think he was going to be that good either
Mark Ingram has to be good again too
He sure does. How is the secondary?
Dunno. They must be better.
Almost no defensive tds last year
They had five or six if I recall. That's about average
Yup. They have to get some touchdowns to help out the defense
Need a lot more three and outs
They did draft a lot of defense this year
They'll need it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Tom Brady was legitimately guilty in the deflation scandal?
I'm not sure, but I don't really care.
Do you like him?
Yeah, I'm fine with him. He plays the position better than anyone.
Why do so many hate him? Jealousy?
No, no one ever hates someone out of jealousy. That's silly.
So why?
They hate him because he's a perfect city boy from up north who does well.
So?
So...who is the primary watcher of the NFL?
Men?
No, generalize a type of individual.
I don't know what you're getting at.
Rednecks. Rednecks love football, and they love their good ol boys from the SEC succeeding, not a handsome guy from Michigan.
Ahh. What about the rest of the team?
The only person I hate is Bill Belichick.
Me too.
He's such a curmudgeon and a bully.
True, I hope they win, but without him.
Good thought!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the Bills haven't made the playoffs since Tom Brady was at Michigan?
I knew it was quite a while. It is hard to win in the AFC East.
Yeah, the Patriots, Patriots! I remember when the Bills were near great. Four consecutive Superbowl appearances!
All losses.I think they should have won at least one of those.
Scott Norwood, the kicker, shanked a 48 yard fild goal.It would have beat Dallas.
Well, at least they got there four times. The Dolphins, just one appearance since the beginning of the Marino era. That, also, was a loss.
The Jets are nearly as bad.They won their only SB when Namath called it against the Colts.
It just proves how dominant the Patriots are.
I remember when the Pats went 1-15 under Rod Rust!
Rust was a great defensive coach.He just was not the head coach type.
The best tackle any Patriot made before the Bill Era was John "Bull" Bramlett tackling a fan who ran onto the field.
I remember.He really leveled him.Those were the days!
It is amazing how the Patriots turned it around.It really started with the hiring of Chuck Fairbanks from Oklahoma
He came in and they changed the culture.They should have won the Superbowl in the late 70s!
The ref, Ben Dreith, made a phantom holding call on Ray Hamilton. It won the game for the Raiders.
I remember that well.It still irks me!
Well, look at us now.Is it possible to be sick of winning?
Well, we are both old enough to remember Carl Garrett, Mike Taliferio, ad nauseum. They were lucky to win 4 games a year!
I guess I will take the present!
Go Pats in 2017!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Quarterbacks these days are so babied by the league.
What do you mean?
I just think there's too many rules in place to protect the quarterback at all costs. It makes the game worse.
I think they have to make rules for the quarterback because their safety is at risk.
How are quarterbacks in more danger than the average player?
If you think about it, quarterbacks are basically sitting ducks when they're just standing in the pocket looking for a passer.
Yeah, I know, but that comes with the terrirtory. It's not like these guys aren't getting paid for it.
But I don't think it's just a matter of being paid for it. They also have to think how it affects the game if quarterbacks get injured often.
To me, it's a part of the game.
I can see where you're coming from, but I also see where the NFL is coming from.
It's just too many rules to protect the quarterback at the expense of the defensive players' abilities to play.
I think the rules are fine. Defensive players are still able to hit the quarterback.
Not like they used to. These days, defensive players can get fined or penalized just for sneezing at a quarterback.
I think that it actually makes defensive players quicker and smarter when they have to play within the new rules.
How so?
When defensive players can't just go all out to hit a quarterback, they have to think about strategy.
I disagree. It limits them.
I think defensive players all of a sudden have to think about approaching the quarter with more skills than just brute force.
Personally, I would rather see the old rules.
I just want to see quarterbacks playing for a whole season even if it means babying them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My Bengals were trash last year.
Huge trash.  What happened there?
Things just fell apart.  Couldn't score, couldn't defend.
Sounds like a good recipe for losing.
And lose they did.  I thought Marvin Lewis was a goner.
He was on the hot seat for quite a while.
I'm glad they didn't fire him though.
He's a good coach, but you can only do so much.
I don't think that Andy Dalton is the right answer though.
He's the definition of an average QB.
Not bad, not great, but not somebody who will get you to the Super Bowl.
But they have nobody behind him right.
Right.  He's the best you can do.
I do think he's got a real weapon to throw to though in AJ Green.
Yeah, straight beast and a top 5 receive in the league.
He was injured a lot last year I think.
Yeah, bad year for him.
Sounds like a bad year for all the Bengals in general.
I think if they stay healthy, they'll be in the thick of it.
Hopefully.  I can't stand the Steelers in that division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think wins the NFC East this year?
The Cowboys for sure.
What makes you think that.
They have the most well rounded team.
Their defense is terrible.
I know they have secondary problems.
Yeah but even their defensive line is depleted with drug suspensions.
Thats true but the offense is their best defense.
While that theory does hold some weight, I am not buying it.
What about the Redskins?
They have too much trouble with the QB position.
How so?
They dont know if they want Cousins there long term
I think that they do
Why havent they offered him a long term contract?
Because they want him to prove it.
How long thoug?
This year is the last he will play on a one year deal
That is not true he could get franchised again
He would make the most money in one year than any other player
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Seattle Seahawks.
Are you just jumping on the bandwagon?!
No.  They're not even as popular as they were.  I just like the team.
Give me New England any day.
Now who's jumping on the bandwagon?
I've liked them for a few years.
Yeah, they've been popular and good for the last few years.
OK. Want me to go with Tampa Bay or Buffalo?
No. You can stick with the Patriots.  I'll stick with Seattle and we'll watch the other teams lose!
Good point!
Maybe we should go shopping for jerseys soon.
I've already got a few.  How about going to a game?
That would be great.
Who would you want to see?
Either one. I'd love to go to a pro football game.
How about if I check around and see what our options are?
Sounds good.  Of course, Seattle or New England would be preferred.
I know.
That would be awesome.  Let me know what you find out.
Sure will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really hope that we get to the Super Bowl this year.
Yes, I really want to face the Patriots go avenge what happened in 2015.
That interception is still on my mind.
Yes, the Seahawks had that Super Bowl wrapped up, I cannot believe that they called a pass play.
Well next time that won't happen, next time we will win.
I totally agree, we are going to take it if we get back against them.
It does suck that Marshawn isn't on the team anymore though.
Yeah, but I get that he wanted to go home to Oakland.
But aren't they moving to Vegas anyway?
Yes, but they'll still be in Oakland next season.
Yeah, that's right, he does still get to play in front of his hometown crowd.
Yes, but I would have loved it if he was the one to run it into the end zone during the rematch.
Oh that would be really good.
Yes, we should also have a pretty easy road to winning the division too.
As long as we stay relatively healthy we will be good.
Easier said than done.
Tell me about it, we will have to hope the key guys can stay on the field.
Yes also hoping for some of the young players to emerge.
I am sure some will take the stage.
Yes, well we should definitely hit up a game when you have time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last Eagles game?
No, did you?
Yes, they have an amazingly talented team.
How so?
They plan such interesting plays I've never seen before.
That's cool.
I think that they are also really good looking!
They are a handsome team.
I like their big muscles.
I like their biceps.  They are the biggest I've seen.
DId they win their last game?
Yes, it was so exciting.
Have you seen them live in person?
Yes, I go to the home games a lot.
Do you have season tickets?
No, but I'd like to get some.
They are hard to get, aren't they?
Yes, and expensive.
Good luck getting some.
Thanks.  I'll invite you sometime if I do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think football players are making too much money these days?
Not really. I think considering how much punishment they put their bodies through, I think it's fair.
I guess you can say that. But still, there's a lot of jobs out there that are physically risky where they don't get paid as much as athletes.
Yeah, but have you seen all the latest reports of athletes developing all these different types of disabilities after their playing careers?
Yeah, they're pretty scary.
That's why I think them getting paid a lot of money is just right.
But there has to be a point where the individual's themselves realize that they're signing up for the risk. Like I said, there are a lot of other jobs that are dangerous, too.
I think it's not that simple. These football players are getting paid a lot because the NFL makes so much money, too.
Correct. But that's usually the rewards the owners and investors get for taking the risk.
You don't think the football players should get some of that money if they're putting their bodies on the line for a more entertaining product?
Yes, to some degree. But getting paid millions of dollars to play a game a few times a year is absurd.
The way I see it, if the NFL can afford to pay them their salaries they should do it. They makes so much money because the fans continue to pay to watch the sport.
I just think the money should rather go back to the fans. Football tickets these days are ridiculous.
Well, if fans continue to pay for those ticket prices, then the owners and league definitely aren't going to make them cheaper.
I guess that's where my frustrations lie from. The fans pay the players' salaries and make the owners rich without any kind of reward.
That's kind of how business works. The fans pay for a product and get what they pay for.
I just think that there has to come a time where the NFL starts showing their appreciation to the fans.
I agree with that to some level.
Maybe I should have became a football player. I would love to make millions.
I'm fine with just watching them. Millions of dollars isn't worth my health.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some of your favorite NFL teams?
I like the colts.
I like them also.
I also like the seahawks.
They are okay. I like the redskins better.
I like them also but I like the new york giants.
They are one of my favorites.
I like the patriots.
I like them but not one of my favorites.
I also like the raiders.
I do to I hope they do better this year.
I do also.
I like the dolphins.
I hope they make it farther than they did last year.
I do to it is their time.
I agree. they deserve to go far.
I like the titans.
where are they located?
In tennessee. they are good.
I agree. they always play hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited for the upcoming NFL season.
I am too, it should be starting soon.
Yes, the NFL pre-season games will kick off in August.
Who is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Green bay packers.
Why do you like the Green Bay packers?
My favorite quaterback of all time played for them.
Who was the quaterback for the Green bay Packers?
Brett Farve was one of the greatest quaterbacks of all time and played for them.
What did Farve do that made him so great.
Brett Farve won a super bowl in 1997 and set many records.
What records did Bret Farve set?
Bret Farve was the first quaterback in history to pass for over 500 touchdowns.
Wow, he must have had a great arm!
Yes he did and completed over 6000 passes in his career.
Did he only play for Green Bay?
Brett Farve spent most of his time at Green Bay, but when he came back after retiring he played for the Vikings.
I bet the fans were upset about that.
Yes, the Vikings are a huge rival for the Packers.
Wow, I hope this season is exciting to watch this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey; you're a Jets fan, aren't you?
shhh...don't speak so loudly.  it's not something i'm proud of and i don't want people to hear me admit it, but yes, i am a long time Jets fan.
I'm a Jets fan too, but i've only followed them for a few seasons so i'm not really familiar with the team's history. can you fill me in?
well, the Jets were originally called the Titans...absolutely no connection with the Tennessee franchise.  they were the Titans for two seasons and played their home games in the old Polo Grounds until the moved into Shea Stadium as the Jets a few years later.
Wow! i never knew their original name was the Titans.  And the Polo Grounds? Are you serious? that was a real stadium?
It sure was.  it was the home of the baseball Giants; the team that moved to San Francisco.  In fact, it's where the Mets played before moving into Shea Stadium, but that's another story.
So the Jets came into existence in 1960, as I understand it...and originally they were in the old American Football League?
that's right.  they were one of the teams in the old A.F.L. that eventually merged with the National Football League.
So the Jets weren't an expansion team because they entered the A.F.L. when the league was brand new?
that's right.  technically they were not an expansion team.  they played in the A.F.L. and eventually that league had so many good players that the established National Football League had no choice but to merge with them.
Very interesting.  And how did the Titans...and then Jets...do in their early years? were they very good?
no, they were not.  they had some mediocre years and some bad years until they drafted the legendary Joe Namath.  That changed the whole franchise and made the team noteworthy.
I've seen some highlight films of Namath and i've also seen him interviewed many times.  He was quite a personality, wasn't he?
He was a fabulous quarterback and he certainly had that confidence that the fans loved so much.
So as soon as Namath joined the team, they were a great team, right?
Actually, no.  Far from it.  the team struggled when Namath got there but they improved gradually until the magical 1968 season.
1968...that was when they won their first super bowl, wasn't it? against the Colts?
Yes, and no.  it was against the Colts, but it wasn't their first super bowl...it's their only super bowl.
what? no wonder you don't want people to know you root for the Jets.  one super bowl in over half a century of games?
now you understand why their nickname is "gang green."  it was their only super bowl win, and in fact their only super bowl appearance.  it's not an easy team to root for, but I continue to root for them.  i'm not sure what that says about me, but i'm looking forward to this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does the NFL miss from its storied past?
Players who truly care about playing hard, performing well and winning.
Players like...?
Earl Campbell is a great example. He gave absolutely everything he had all the time. And to this day he's glad he did.
Players like him built the NFL we know today.
There was a lot of entertainment value in watching players like Campbell, or Walter Payton, or Mike Singletary, or Ron Jaworski.
Could today's declining interest in NFL football be attributed to such a comparison?
Many people see much less entertainment value in watching players pull up short on tackles and jogging to the ball during plays.
Will Amazon be a good broadcast partner for the NFL?
Hard to say. The NFL's internet-based broadcast experiments of the last few years have been ephemeral and have produced underwhelming results.
Which teams are lost causes at this point?
The 49ers are one. Their ownership has taken a resuscitated perennial title contender and reduced it to a semi-professional outfit. The new hires have their work cut out for them, but Lynch and Shanahan give them hope.
What about the Bears?
Chicago has the same problem as San Francisco. No one seems to know what he is doing and the team lurches into the new season like a twitching, plodding zombie.
Do the Dolphins belong in this group?
No, Miami is a mid-level team with some promise, but ownership and management do hurt the Dolphins regularly.
What about Cleveland?
The Browns are still the same. New ownership is needed I'm afraid. Bad uniforms don't help.
The Lions might be good, or bad...
Detroit could go a few different directions, but they are still easy to predict: they are a mediocre team that produces mediocre results.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I know we both like the Bucs, so I was wondering if you wanted to go to a NFL game? My treat.
That would be awesome, but what game would you be interested in seeing?
Well, I guess we could both figure that out now.  What other team do you like?
The Panthers. What other team do you like?
Miami; both the Florida teams.
Ha Ha. Miami?
What is so funny?
Miami is horrible, I don't even know why they are still a NFL team.
That is your opinion.
Last year, their game stat was 10-6.
Okay, that does not mean that they did not improve, since last year.
I'm not saying that, but do you remember how bad they lose. Remember the game between them and the Ravens 6-38.
Yes I must say, "that was a big ouch," but the other losses were not that bad. Maybe only a 12 to 15 point deficit.
And you have to admit, they don't give much of a game to watch.
Okay, okay, then what team would you want to see the Bucs play.
How about not choosing any of the teams we both like.
Okay that sounds fair, so I'm just going to say a team and you agree or disagree.
Okay, let me hear it.
New Orleans Saints should give us a good game to watch.
Sounds good to me, I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the NFL pre-season start this year?
Sometime in the first week of August.
What team are you rooting for this year
The Dolphins, like always.
Good luck with that.
I know right. What team are you rooting for?
I like Tampa Bucs and want to see them go to the superbowl.
I think they have a pretty good chance.
The team has potential, but it's not the same since all the good players are gone.
Like who? Just name one.
Ok. Definitely, Warren Sapp.
Yes. He was an awesome player.
I heard all those concussions had an impact on his brain.
I heard something about that too, and I believe he is donating his brain to research because of his memory issues.
That's right. He will be a team player that is always remembered.
Yes, I know you know he made it into the Hall of Fame back in 2013.
How not? This great defensive tackle from 1995-2007 gave the world great, game performance to be remembered.
He also did a lot for others off the field too.
Well, I hope your Dolphins make you happy this year.
Same to you, about your Bucs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited to see the roster for the New York Giants. I know some of them.
Yes! Amazing team.
Odell Beckham Jr is still a wide reciever.
He is good no doubt.
Of course Eli Manning is the quarterback.
I love him. I wish Peyton still played.
I do too. he was of great value to the teams he played with.
He did amazing with the Colts.
Brandon Marshall is still playing and he is a wide reciever.
I like him and I like seeing him on sports shows also.
Ereck Flowers plays tackle.
I am unsure if I have heard of him.
He is good.
I will have to look him up and look at his stats.
Josh Johnson is also a quarterback.
I am unaware of him also. There is alot I have to look into!
I am sure he will play if he is needed.
Hopefully Eli will do better this year.
I hope so too, Manning's have a lot of value.
I agree. Great football family right there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
New Orleans Saints is my favorite team.
They began in 1966.
That's 50 years ago.
They are headquartered in the city of Metairie.
That is where their training camp is also.
They used to be in the Eastern Conference.
Then they were in the NFC West.
Now they are in the NFC South.
Their uniform is Gold and Black.
Sometimes it is White and Gold.
They have a fight song.
When the Saints go marching in.
Their mascot is Gumbo.
That's funny.
Tom Benson is the owner.
General manager is Mickey Loomis.
Sean Payton is a good head coach.
The Aints does not seem like a good nick name for them.
They have 10 playoff appearances.
They had temporary stadiums in 2005.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Bro, Whats up? I haven't seen you in a long time!
I know! When was the last time again?
It was at the Miami Dolphins home game in the Hard Rock Stadium.
Oh yeah that was such a good game!
So did you buy season tickets for this season?
No unfortunately I could not!
But you know we get a discount from our job this year right?
What? I didnt know that
Yeah we get 20% off all home games
Wow, how do I find out more about this?
Talk to Ron on monday and he will let you know
Wow thanks bro!
No problem!
I guess, I will be seeing you at the games afterall
Yeah and at the tail-gate parties!
oh yeah!
You remember last year with all those chicken wings?!
Oh yeah and the beer!!
yeah all you can drink bro!
I will definitely talk to Ron on monday!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Dolphins?
Miami Dolphins?
Yes
I love them
Are they your favorite team?
Yes
Do you like their stadium?
I've been twice and loved it
Who is your favorite all time player?
Dan Marino
He was amazing
He had a great arm
He definitely did
Their colors are amazing too
I hope they win it this year
They have the potential
I know. They should have made it last year
Do you think they can beat the Patriots?
Yes
We'll see what happens this year
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some teams that you're excited about in the NFL next season?
I'm pretty excited to watch the Raiders.
That's a good answer.
They made some really strong acquisitions in the draft.
Yeah, Marshawn Lynch being one of them.
Yeah. He's going to rise that team to new levels.
They are fun to watch anyways. It's going to be fun to see them do well next season.
I agree. They have a powerful fanbase and a lot of people that support them.
I'm excited to watch Russel Wilson and the Seahawks.
I really like watching Russel play. He's a good decision maker.
Yeah, and their defense is just plain scary.
That's definitely the strong point of their team.
Opposing teams are scared to pass against them.
It's easy to see why. They make so many defensive plays.
It's rare to see that, too. Usually teams are built around an explosive offense.
I agree. It's cool to see some new strategy in play.
I agree. I'm also excited to watch Cam Newton.
Definitely. I've always supported him as a top ten quarterback.
I agree. He stays really calm under pressure.
That's what allowed him to get very close to first place as a quarterback last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do the Colts look this year.
Well, It depends on what you think Luck will do.
I think Luck has a big year.
I do too. I bet they win the division.
I want more than the division.
What do you mean?
I want them in the Super Bowl.
They have the talent.
I think they are due.
I miss Peyton Manning still.
Well, who wouldn't?
It's a shame he didn't retire a Colt.
I agree with that.
But, I understand the reasoning.
Lets hope Luck brings a trophy home.
I think they win twelve games this year.
I think that's a possibility.
I worry about the defense.
I think it'll be alright.
Let's get season tickets!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! I got two tickets to the big game this weekend. Wanna go?
Yeah, which teams are playing?
Dallas Cowboys and The New England Patriots! This game is gonna be sweet! Cowboys are definitely gonna win.
I doubt that! Watch Tom Brady take this game as usual.
I'm gonna get ready for the big game tonight. The Oakland Raiders against The New York Giants. Hands down on Oakland taking the win tonight.q
Eli Manning has nothing on Derek Carr! His skills just don't match up.
No way, the Giants ALWAYS take home the game! Come over and let's see whose team wins!
Sounds like a plan, I'll be over there by 8.
Oh yeah! Seattle Seahawks against the Pittsburgh Steelers tomorrow night. Who do you think is gonna win?
Are you kidding? That's not even a question, Seattle Seahawks. Have you seen how well Russel Wilson has been playing lately?
Yeah but, Ben Ben Roethlisberger has been throwing down such powerful throws lately. I think Steelers would win.
Well, let's see who wins tomorrow then, shall we?
The game is about to come on! Are you going to watch?
I've been so busy lately, I don't even know which teams are playing tonight.
The Green Bay Packers and the Denver Broncos.
Did you see how well The Green Bay Packers are doing? Aaron Rodgers has such speed.
Yeah, I agree. I think the Broncos might win this one though. Rodgers' speed is no match for Trevor Siemian's skills!
Hey who's playing the game this weekend?
Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers. This is going to be such a great game. I'm excited to see how well Carson Wentz improved.
He's gotten better but not as good as Brian Hoyer. Watch the 49ers take this game this time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have such a big crush on Matt Wolfe.
Yes, he is cute.
He scored 10 points in yesterday's game.
That's impressive.
I couldn't believe it.
So he got them a win?
Basically.
Wow.
He's also cute and single!
And living 10 hours away in Columbia.
I can travel....for a "game."
I'm so sure.
You wanna come with.
Actually, sounds like fun.
For me!!
Only because you're crushing.
Of course.
Let's go to thier next home game.
Book it.
Will do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So football season is almost upon us once again.
Ugh.  Yeah I know.  Time to become a football widow again.
I kind of like watching sometimes.  I like the Steelers they have some great players.
The Steelers are the Cincinnati team right?
No, I think that's the Bengals.  The Steelers are from Pittsburgh.
Oh yeah that's right.  Wasn't there an ohio team who started in Cincinnati first and then moved?
Yeah I think it was the Cleveland Browns maybe?
I don't think the Browns are a very good team are they?
No I don't think they have won a game in like 30 years.
No surely it hasn't been that long!
No it's probably been more recent than that.  But they don't give up, they just keep going.
Yeah you have to admire their stamina despite almost always losing.
That's true.  They are truly the underdogs and when they finally do win the super bowl, or even get to go, it's going to be epic.
I don't see that ever happening. It might, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
It would be great to see a team that hardly ever wins go out there and win it all one season.
Yeah that would almost make me want to watch football.
I know right! All the predictability makes it almost boring to watch.  Like where is the fun with all the stats?  It's like you already know who is going to win.
It does take a little of the surprise out of it.
Wow, our husbands would love to hear us talking like this!
Yes but let's never tell them, then they will want us to watch the games with them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Chicago Bears' chances this year?
ESPN predicted that they would go 6-10, but I think that is too optimistic.
Why do you think that they will win less than 6 games this year?
My number one concern is at quarterback. I think that the Bears overpaid for Mike Glennon.
I think you're right. And then after they spend all that money on Glennon, the Bears turn around and draft a quarterback in the first round!
God, what a terrible decision that was.
But if Trubisky turns out to be a franchise quarterback, then the trade will look great.
That's an awfully big "if".
I don't think that you're giving the Bears enough credit after this last draft.
Well, they did not get a good draft grade on any website that I saw.
And don't forget about all the injuries that the Bears had on defense last year.
True. That defense was decimated by injuries all year.
I think that Vic Fangio is one of the best defensive coordinators in the NFL, and that the defense will be great once it's healthy again.
So then you're putting all of your faith in the Bears' Defense?
Yes. And I'm not disagreeing with you that the Bears have a QB problem.
I really hope you're right.
Me too. It really ruins my Sundays when tbe Bears are terrible.
Me too. I'm just getting my sons to watch football with me, and they'll lose interest if tbe Bears are awful this year.
They won't be great, but I also don't think that they'll be as awful as you fear.
I love your optimism!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking about the NFL uniforms and wondered how they were ranked as to best and worst.
Interesting. What did you find out?
One poll showed  Seattle Seahawks as the best and Jacksonville Jaguars the worst.
I think those are both really boring uniforms.
I agree but not as boring as Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They fit terrible and they look like the leftover candy from Halloween that you liked the least.
Wow that's a heck of a description!
Cleveland Browns are about on the same level they look like brown and orange candy corn.
I like Green Bay and Pittsburgh Steelers uniforms. They make a statement.
Yes those are good ones for sure.
I wonder how expensive uniforms are?
The helmets cost around $1000 and I think the jersey is  about $200  and pants $100.
Then you have all the other "extras".
Yeah it's ridiculous  when you start thinking about what they are charged from these sports companies.
Yeah like 35-50 for a pair of socks!
No wonder they charge so much for tickets
Everybody gouges everybody else because they know they can get away with it.
Vendors screwing the patrons with ridiculous vending prices and the stadiums screwing the vendors for primo spots to sell there wares or food.
yeah unless you are rich it's almost impossible to go to a game.
They don't give a crap about the common man.
Yes  i wished they would make it more affordable for more people
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what's your opinion on the NFL as a company?
I think they have a good track record for the most part.
I was thinking the same thing the other day. They avoid controversy well.
They really do. It seems like they try to do the right thing in most cases.
There might be a little bit of money corruption but that's to be expected.
Yeah, every now and then you'll hear players complaining about money issues.
I think you'll have that in any big organization.
It's a little crazy for them to complain considering how much they make per year.
Their contracts do vary a great deal, though.
That is true. Who is your favorite team?
I'm a huge Saints fan. Who is your favorite team?
I'm pretty partial to the Green Bay Packers.
Nice. Do you think they'll make the playoffs this year?
Definitely. I'm hoping they take the Super Bowl.
I could see it happening. I've always admired their offense.
I agree. They have good coordination.
Who do you think poses the biggest challenge to them?
Ultimately, Tom Brady has proven to be a pretty scary adversary.
I think the Seahawks are going to be hard to beat, also.
I agree. They'll remain to be a tough team to play around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So it loks like the Bucs want Ali Marpet as the center lineman.
I'm not happy with that decision.
Why not?
Kevin Pamphile should be center lineman.
Why do you think that?
Look as his stats last season and in 2015, superior numbers each season.
Yes but Ali is looking really good this year.
Well, yeah in training camp. It will be different come pre-season.
I think he will shine, give him a chance.
Well, that;s the problem too many seasons have elapsed to create a good team.
It takes time to do that.
Yes, but with the Bucs they shave off people every season and it's like starting over.
I see what you mean, they cant gel as a team.
Exactally. Times up. lets win games.
I hear ya but i think theres more to it.
How so?
Well, these are sports experts and they know more about this than we do.
True, but like with everything there is a bit of common sense with everything. Somethings they do make no sense.
I share your frustration. Hopefully this season will be different
I'm hoping so as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the NFL thjis off season?
yes, some ... Marshaun Lynch to the Raiders, the Raiders moving to Los Vegas, and the draft.
It'll be interesting to see if the Raiders QB will come back after his injury. Also, they lost their RD to Minnesota.
Raiders may still be up there, but Brady and the Patriots are the team to beat.
Yes, I know. I'm a Bills fan, and NE picked up the Bills best cornerback in free agency. That's after the Chris Hogan disaster.
So NE improved on a Superbowl team. That's impressive.
Yes, the Bills have a new coach, but have some rebuilding to do. They won't end up in last place with the Jets in their division.
Okay, the Pats are the team to beat, but who can do it?
KC looks strong, with Andy Reid, if they stay healthy. The Raiders, if Lynch still has something left. Pittsburgh is always in the hunt.
Some team will shine, like Denver did with that defense a couple of years ago.
I 'm an AFC fan, and don't follow the NFC much. Who's rising there?
Carolina, maybe the NY Giants, seem to be up on top.
Which team got the best from free agency or the draft?
NE got Buffalo's Safety. A lot of changes, but nothing that seems to be a turnaround.
The Vikings got the Raiders best RB. Watch out for the Jaguars, Tom Coughlin is back down there, to work on things.
It'll be interesting to see which of the new coaching staffs do well. Example Buffalo's or Jacksonville's.
I will be watching Coughlin. He put together teams several times, he'll do it again.
Don't leave out Pittsburgh. In November there always looking at playoff positioning.
It's wait and see for now. I'll have to read more on the pre-season predictions.
Yes, the sports editors write a lot, but sometimes they miss things like Denver's defense 2 years ago.  See ya.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's going to be the worst team in the NFL this year?
Is it wrong that my mind instantly flashes to the Browns?
Haha, can't blame you. They've been bad for a while.
That said, I actually liked their draft last year.
But is that going to be enough to change their fortunes next year?
It might take a couple of years, and a few more good drafts.
Yeah, they've certainly had some bad drafts in recent years.
What about the 49ers?
They're a contender for worst team, if only because I don't like their quarterbacks.
The surest way to have a terrible record in the NFL is to have no stability at the QB position.
I think the 49s could bounce back a little, though. They have some some talent.
How about good old Jacksonville?
Now there's a team with talent! If Jacksonville could figure out the QB position, I think they could be really good.
I guess that's what picking at the top of the draft year after year does for you.
Yeah, they've stock piled some really good players, especially on defense.
I still think the Jaguars will underperform this year.
I wouldn't bet against you.
I think the Bears will be better, so my final answer is the 49ers.
Fair enough. They really do need to figure out their QB situation.
Yep, and I don't think they get it done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the NFL?
I love it
How do you feel about the upcoming year?
I am excited about it.
Who do you think will win?
I think the Patriots will repeat
Really
Oh yes
They have a good team
Yes, and I think everyone is healthy
They have a great offense
And a good defense
That is true
Who do you think can beat them?
The Texans
I don't know about that
They have a great team
It id good to see that they are finally winning
I hope they do good this year
I am sure they will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go to the football game tonight?
Which one?
The Eagles vs. the Bears.
Sounds great.
I can't wait to tailgate.
Wow, I'd love to do that.
What do you like to eat?
I like burgers and potatoes.
You can find that at a football tailgate!
Sounds great.
Who do think will win tonight?
I think that the Eagles are going to win this time.
It was a tough battle last time they were matched up.
You bet.
I hope the Eagles win.
They sure have some great players.
Yes, I love Ryan and Jordan Matthews.
Ertz is fun to watch as well.
Let's pack and get going.
This should be exciting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, tell me about your picture here.
The one at Ray-Jay?
Yes, that was during a game, right?
Yes, that was my first Bucs game i went too.
Very cool. that was 16 years ago.
Correct. Scott and i went to the Bucs VS New England game.
Right on. How was it?
Good game, funny story behind it.
Really? What happened?
Well, it was the second quarter. Bout a minute or two before half-time.
Bucs winning or losing?
Winning if you can believe that.
Right on, continue.
So as usual the afternoon storm came rolling in and there was a delay of game.
I hate when that happens.
Me too. Anyway, this lightning bolt came down right in the parking lot!
NO WAY!
Yes. It took out someones truck.
Oh wow.
Yeah, scott was freaking because we parked on that side where the lightning struck. Fun times at the stadium.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you know if Carson Palmer is playing another season?
I'm pretty sure he is. I think he really wants the ring.
Him and Fitzgerald both I guess.
Yeah, I think this may be their last season, though...
They they'd better get some young players and start grooming them for later
They really should get a few prospects now anyway. But I thought the back up QB was pretty good last season...
Yeah, I can't think of his name though...
Stanton? I think that was his name..
Yes, Stanton. He did good though.
Yeah, he was decent but we need another really strong starting quarterbacks.
And receivers, too. So, we basically need more offensive players.
At least we have a good running back. David Johnson is pretty impressive!
Yeah and he is young! Hopefully he will play for us for a while.
Let's hope so. We can't afford to lose him.
I can't wait till they have the draft!
Me, too, but it's always a bit nerve wracking...
I know, right? I don't want teams like Cowboys getting good players!
Ugh, I can't believe how good they were last season!
I know! And how bad the Browns were...ha ha ha!
Oh my gosh! I'd hate to be a Browns fan!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that JJ Watt is going to have a good season this year?
I think as long as he is healthy, he has a chance at being the defensive MVP.
I'm not sure that he is the most dominate defensive player in the NFL anymore, there are some great younger guys.
I think that JJ has the experience and the work ethic that continually makes him elite.
But, he doesn't have the championships and now he is coming back from significant injury.
Well, the quarterback situation in Houston is likely getting better, but it's more about the young guys on Houston's defense that will influence how much time he sees.
So you think that his playing time is going to decrease because of the injury and younger guys?
Not nessecarily. Look at a guy like Julius Peppers, in his 30s not playing on a limited snap count.
I think Julius Peppers is the exception, not the rule though. He takes really good care of himself.
So does JJ Watt. He trains hard and keeps focused during the season so that his teammates can count on him.
It will be interesting to see how he compares with some of the rookies that were drafted this year and some of the younger guys in the league.
Yeah, I think Myles Garrett is going to be a big disrupter in the NFL, but I also look to guys like Taco Charlton to make a difference.
I think there are two vets who are better than JJ and will likely show up bigger than Garrett and Taco; Khalil Mack and Von Miller.
Mack and Miller are no doubt in conversation for the most talented, but JJ has potential to make a huge comeback this year because he will have a chip on his shoulder.
I think both Mack and Miller have the same chip, even without serious injury. Both played for a team that should've played deeper into the playoffs.
Especially Mack! Oakland is ready to challenge this year with both their offense and defense!
Derek Carr and Amari Cooper have made Oakland exciting to watch, but sometimes I think Mack is all alone on defense out there.
That's a lot like JJ Watt. Even with talent on the defensive roster, sometimes it felt like only he was playing.
It will likely look even more like that this year because of Wilfork's absence.
Yes! He added a much needed veteran presence and really pushed JJ in terms of leadership and awareness.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?
In a way, yes, but over the last few years I've lost some interest in the NFL.
Why is that?  You used to be such a die hard fan for years.
The problem is the way the NFL has marketed the game on TV.
You mean with all the commercials?
That's a big part of it.  The games now go on for 3 hours or more and I tend to lose interest unless it's really tight.
I know what you mean.  Most people don't want to spend 3 hours watching a football game.
I was watching a game last year and realized that it was like 3 or 4 plays and then a series of commercials.
That's true.  And then it starts over again - a few plays and then more commercials.
When you figure that the game is only 60 minutes, not including time outs, the commercials take up way more time than the game itself.
I guess it's all about making money for the NFL and the teams.  The commercials pay the bills.
It's like a catch 22 problem for the NFL.  The bigger salaries require more commericals which allow them to pay bigger salaries which require more commercials.
Can't you just DVR the game and skip through the commercials.
I tried doing that but it's not the same experience.
You mean because you already know the outcome.
Exactly.  It's just not the same as watching it live.
So are you still going to watch some of the games?
Sure.  But I'll be selective and if the game is not interesting I just won't sit through all those commercials.
Do you know others who have given up on the NFL because of so many commercials on TV?
I do know a few but the NFL has a problem with the fan base and the solution is not easy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the draft?
No, I totally missed it, What happened?
Well as usual Belicheck made careful choices
I just love this guy
I know me too. It just gets it
I wish we could clone him
Well, him and Brady. The guy is a machine.
I know. Its just amazing.
The amazing thing is they just find people for the system
I know it. How?
Maybe they are smarter than everyonelse?
Must be something in the water
What did you think of this years picks
I thought they were solid
yeah, I was a bit confused but I guess there is a bigger picture
Maybe, drafting for what they think they can become?
Or trading pieces down the road
I guess..I never thought of that
I am glad other teams don't get this idea
No kidding...thanks Jets
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any new rules or changes for the upcoming NFL season?
I haven't heard of any yet.  Why?
I was just hoping they haven't messed with it. I like the games the way they are.
Me too.  i do have to admit though, that I like the change about kicking field goals.
Yeah, that did turn out to be a good one.  I had heard that they may want to do away with kicking all together though.
I heard that too and I hope they don't.  Kicking is an important part of the game.
It would be like doing away with punts.  You have to punt and have a return.
That's what makes the game interesting. You wait to see if the guy can run it all the way back or not.
True! So kicking is exciting.
It is!  What did you think of the female referree they had last year?
I thought she would be just a publicity stunt but I did see her try and break up a fight once.
That was surprising!  I thought she'd be to "cheerleader like" to do something like that.
Basically she just did her job and didn't make a deal about being a woman.
True, she did.  I wonder if the NFL will ever have a woman head coach!
Probably not for a long, long time!  More women have to get involved with watching the games first!
You can't coach what you don't know.  You have me thinking about rules and stuff and there's a lot to learn.
The NFL looks pretty simplistic but it's really not.
I wish the NFL would lower ticket prices to the games while we are talking about changes and stuff.
Oh me too!  It's way better to just watch on tv!
When you watch on tv you can see more emotions of the players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like watching football more at the stadium or at home?
I think I like watching it more at home.
Really? why?
Because I like watching more than one game at a time.
Is that all?
If a game is bad or boring, I can watch a different one.
I guess that's a good reason.
I can also eat whatever I want, and drink whatever I want.
Those $7 beers do get kind of old.
I can invite whoever I want over to watch it with me, and we don't have to pay a ridiculous amount to get in.
Those are all good points.
Yeah, why were you asking?
I had an extra ticket for the Cowboys game, I thought maybe you would be interested.
I am interested!
I thought you said you prefer to watch it at home?
I do, unless I can go to a game with my best friend.
Haha, good save.
What time should I be ready?
How's around 10 sound?
sounds perfect!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
I love it!
Oh, yea?  What is your favorite team?
Seahawks!
Really?  Why's that?
No specific reason.  I've just always liked them
Oh okay.
And your favorite team?
Patriots
Classic
Yea they are probably the most liked team in the NFL
... Or the most hated...
Haha! Lots of hate come when you're good!
I don't know about that
Still sore over the end of that one Superbowl game?
I guess you could say that
It was an amazing finish though
I can agree to that!
Talk to you later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how about those Cowboys, huh?
I'm looking forward to the upcoming season!
You know I'm a Giants fan, but I gotta ask an honest question, do you think Dak Prescott's gonna have a sophmore slump?
I hope not! He's the future of the Cowboys! I kind of expect it though.
I'm looking forward to the Giants shutting him down twice a season.
I don't know about the Giants defense, though, can any of your defensive backs cover Dez Bryant?
I like our chances. How about you guys and covering Odell Beckham?
You guys got a lot of great receivers now, but it's gonna be hard to take advantage when we knock Eli on his back!
Eh.. we'll see.
You guys still got Ereck Flowers, and our pass rush is dangerous.
True, Eli's gonna have to get rid of the ball quickly, but our defensive line is good, too!
Well, yeah, but the Cowboys have a great offensive line. Why do you think Prescott and Elliott tore defenses to shreds last season?
We know what's coming, and we'll be ready!
I certainly hope so. It's still gonna be some great games, but you know I'm pulling for the Cowboys until the day I die.
The Giants/Cowboys Sunday Night week 1 has become a tradition.
Too bad we don't play each other on Thanksgiving.
I think it's about time the Giants got to play on Thanksgiving, but they're playing the Redskins.
That team's a mess.
Tell me about it, their situation with Cousins is silly. Pay the man already.
Well, they paid Albert Haynesworth a whole lot of money one time and look what happened!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's have a conversation on football
Like about the game?
A serious conversation. I'm against football.
Why's that?
Football is an extremely dangerous sport, yet kids grow up wanting to be the next Peyton Manning.
That's why they wear protective gear. Sure it's a rough sport but that's the fun of it
Did you know that more than 20% of NFL players report head trauma injuries?
That's pretty high but it's a toll that they pay for the sport.
Okay. So the problem is, why don't people know how dangerous it is? There should be parental advisories
I think people should just choose to play what they want.
They can choose, as long as they have knowledge.
Knowledge of what?
Consequences.
That's fair. I agree with you on that.
This way, parents can sign up their kids for little league football after the kid knows they can get a concussion.
This reminds me of a movie recently.
Which movie?
Concussion. It stars Will Smith.
I'll have to check it out.
Please do. It's quite relevant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bill Romanowski is pretty crazy, even by linebacker standards!
I would say he's crazy by any standards!
I hope he's ashamed of himself for punching that one tight end in the eye!
Yeah really.  He ended the guys career with one punch.  People that strong shouldn't punch people, period.
From what I remember, he crushed the guy's eye socket.  It was his own team member too and it happened during a scrimmage.
That's true, he also attacked people who weren't on his team, while playing the game in arenas too.
Yeah, from what I remember he punched a guy, he kicked a guy in the head and he banged helmets with someone.
That's true.  Kerry Collins was the quarterback of the Carolina Panthers, and it broke his jaw!
Yeah, I just looked it up and he was fined $20,000.
That's good. Marcus Williams is the teammate whose eye socket he crushed with the punch.
Yeah, he sued him and claimed that he was on steroids and that's what made him so aggressive.
Well that totally reminds me that he was involved with BALCO labs and the whole scandal.
Really?  I didn't know that.
Yes it's true.  He was totally on steroids, "the clear" and "the cream".
Wow, same as Barry Bonds and those other guys.
Yep.  He was always really big on a lot of different things to keep himself in top shape.
That I knew.  For some reason I didn't know he was on all sorts of steroids.
Well he was.  They were designer staroids.
Amazing.  He just left no stone unturned in his quest to be the best athlete he could.
That's true, but it's too bad he was a slapper of people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so pumped for football season! IT will be here before we know it!
Me too! I  can't wait
Who do you have winning the Superbowl this year?
I have to pull for the Seahawks.
The Seahawks? Really?
Yeah!Who else is it gonna be?
I have to go with my COWBOYS!
The cowboys? You're joking, right??
No! You saw them last season! And it was their first season with Dak as QB
That was just a fluke
A fluke?? No way. More like destiny and a little preview of what they have to build on for the future
(laughs) yeah, right.
You'll see.   What makes you think the Seahawks are gonna pull it off anyway?
Just a good feeling...and look at their team! They are stacked
(laughs)  Thats about the worst reason I have ever heard.
Just wait and see!
They play each other at some point in the season.
Yeah, they do.... And the Seahawks are going to stomp the cowboys
I guess we will see when they play on December 24.
I guess so! It'll be an interesting Christmas Eve, for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the NFL?
I think it is incredible.
Me too.
I can't wait for the season to begin.
Absolutely.
What team are you rooting for?
I'm rooting for the Eagles this season.
How about the Steelers?
No way.  I bleed green!
Which team do you want to see them play the most?
I want to see the Eagles vs. the Redskins.
That sounds like a great matchup.
You bet.
What are the prospects for the Eagles?
Well they had a bit of a rough season last year, but it should be better this year.
Really, how'd they do last season.
They went with 7 wins and 9 losses, but I hope for better this year.
Boy, I hope you are right for your sake.
I want to get to the games this year.
Take me with you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like the seahawks
Me too
I even have a little seattle seahawks sweater for my dog
That sounds adorable
It is
They are a good team
My dog and i will match on game days
Does it bring them luck?
Yes
They won a superbowl pretty recently, didnt they?
2014
Yes thats kind of recent
Hopefully they will being another one home
That woukd be cool
It would
Maybe matching sweaters will make it happen
Hopefully
It would be cool
It would
Good talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Superbowl last year?
Yes, I watch it almost every year.
I thought it was great. Lady Gaga had such an amazing performance.
Why are you telling me about the artists instead of the game itself?
The hafltime show is always the highlight, at least for me.
The halftime show is great, but it shouldn't be your highlight.
What was your highlight of last year's Superbowl then?
Well I'm originally from Atlanta, so it was exciting to see my hometown team Falcons be in the finals.
Didn't they lose?
Yes, ultimately they lost. But we were ahead for a lot of the game.
Who cares? You lost!
I care! We lost this year, but hopefully we'll keep up the momentum and do better next season.
Well you really could only go up from here...
Very funny.
Oh, I've just remembered another highlight from the game?
Please tell me it's actually related to the actual game or a player this time
It is. Tom Brady was my highlight - he's hot!
Remind me never to invite you over to my house to watch the Superbowl.
Why not??
I like to be surrounded by only true fans of the sport.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Seahawks still have Russell Wilson though, and a great defense.
You're right, and their division is not very good.
I don't know, I think the Cardinals will be very good this season.
Yeah, but Carson Palmer fell off last year. If you don't have a good QB it's hard to be good.
But they still have David Johnson and Larry Fitzgerald, those are some of the best players.
Their defense has taken a real hit too. I think the Seahawks win the west, but they're not as good as the Cowboys.
The Cowboys are really going to rely on Dak Prescott being a great quarterback.
I think he is. He is better than the other guys in the division. Kirk Cousins is very overrated.
You're right. I think Dallas can win their division, but I don't think they're as good as the Seahawks or Falcons.
The Falcons are one of Seattle's biggest threats. They have an elite offense.
They did last year, but they got great years out of a lot of players.
They still have Julio Jones and Matt Ryan, the MVP, plus a great running game.
They do, but the NFC South is probably the best division, they don't have a  bad team.
I'm not convinced the Saints will be that good, but you're right it's a strong division.
The Saints have Peterson now. I think their running game will be very strong.
Adrian Peterson might be washed up. He's also always injured. I'm not sure he's enough to compete with the other teams in the division.
That's a good point. There's also the Packers in the North, they're always good.
I agree, the Packers are a strong team. So it looks like we've picked the division winners. Do you still think the Seahawks?
I do, I think they're a better team than Dallas, Green Bay or Atlanta, and they have the experience.
Yes, but Atlanta and Green Bay have both been to Super Bowls recently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the worst franchise in the NFL?
A few years ago I would have said the Raiders, but it has to be the Jags..
Small market problems?
Yeah small problems and a college football state.
Well the Titans are in Tennessee and that's a college football state.
Yes it is, but in Florida you have The Gators, 'Noles and the 'Canes.
Yeah, you're right.
In Tennessee you just have the Volunteers and their program is far from its past prominence.
Did you like Tebow?
Well, he should have moved over to tight end.
I agree, have been saying that for years.
Yes, If you look at his skillset and physicality it's not prototypical NFL quarterback, it's Tight End.
So why didn't he?
That's a multi-million dollar question. I would say hubris.
Ok, what is the best franchise?
That's easy, the Patriots?
And the 2nd best?
Has to be the Steelers. They do damage in the playoffs basically every year.
The Broncos have really come up though.
Yes they have, but the Steelers have been up for a long time now and I doubt they will diminish anytime soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, do you follow football?
Yeah, I'm a Patriots fan.
Lucky you, still enjoying the trophy?
Yeah right, that game was really crazy.
I hate the Patriots but even I have to admit that was insane.
Yeah man, I will never forget that win.
What do you think this year?
About the Patriots? They will probably go deep into the playoffs but I don't know about the Superbowl this year.
Why not?
I just think Brady is getting a little old, and he can still play well but I don't know about another Superbowl.
They are the best team in the league right now aren't they?
All-around, coaching included, probably yes, but the Falcons are going to be hot with revenge, man.
True that Atlanta coach is probably still fuming.
Plotting ways of revenge.
Hahaha, anyway, I think if the Patriots aren't the best team in the league the Seahawks are because of defense.
The Patriots have a nasty defense though too.
Yeah but they are all getting older and the rest of the league is figuring them out now.
You can study Tom Brady for years and still not have him "figured out". Look at the last Superbowl as an example.
Good luck this year man, try not to deflate any balls this time.
Very funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Only 10 days until the NFL training camp starts!
I know, right! I can't wait to see what our rookies do from the draft!
What is your favorite NFL team?
I reallly like the Cincinnati Bengals.
Oh yeah, I follow them. I'm not a huge fan of their head coach Marvin Lewis but I do Ii,e the quarterback Andy Dalton.
Andy Dalton is hit or miss for the most part. He puts up huge numbers on game day typically.... it's mind blowing.
At least we don't have the Browns quarterback!
That's so true! The Cleveland Browns are by far the worst team in football!
Johnny Manuel was such a bust, what a waist of talent!
Yep, the browns got screwed on that one!!
Between the Browns and the Steelers I'm not sure which one I hate the most.
The Steelers play so dirty, I can't stand them either.... plus their coach is a smug asshole!
I'm Ben is pretty amazing. He plays hurt like it's his job
He's clutch under two minutes. I don't know how he pulls that off every single time!
Talk about clutch under two minutes..... Tom Brady
I swear Tom Brady has had to have sold his soul to the devil!
Dude is awesome.... deflate gate or not, he's good
True that! Between Brady and Gronk, pretty much unstoppable
You think they will win another ring this year???
Good chance of it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so you think the Falcons will be able to make it back to the super bowl?
No, in fact, I don't think they'll win the NFC south this year.
Who do you think will win?
Honestly I could see any team winning it this year, it will be the toughest division.
That's true, and now the Saints have Adrian Peterson.
Exactly, they should be better, and don't forget about Carolina.
Yeah, Cam Newton won't have another down year.  When he's good they should contend for a super bowl.
What's your take on Tampa Bay?
They're a young team, but should be better this year than last.
Given all that, I just don't think the falcons have it in them.
Plus, they lost Kyle Shanahan to San Francisco, do you think that will hurt them?
I do.  Matt Ryan was mediocre at best before he came along, and then with him he won the MVP.
So if it's not the falcons repeating, who wins it all this year?
I think it will be the Patriots vs Green Bay.
You still think Brady can play at a high level?
I do, and I think he wouldn't continue playing if he couldn't.
That's true, he wants to win and I don't think he would play either if he couldn't continue winning.
And green bay will always be good with Aaron Rodgers.  They've lost a lot, but still have the pieces in place.
Should be another great season.
Yeah, I'm looking forward to the fall already.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on J.J. Watt?
He's probably the most gifted defensive player of this generation.
I find him to be overrated if we're being honest.
Really? He is a three time NFL Defensive Player of the Year and a match up nightmare for offenses.
Yeah, but in the last two seasons that he won that award, the Texans either missed the playoffs or were blown out 30-0 in the Wild Card Round.
That's not his fault! He's only a defensive end and can't control the game like a quarterback.
I guess I am tough on him because people always say that he should not just win the Defensive Player of the Year award, but also the regular season MVP award too.
Well lets examine his stats from the 2014 season. He had 20.5 sacks, 4 forced fumbles, 5 defensive touchdowns, and 3 receiving touchdowns.
And his team went 7-9 and missed the playoffs.
Again, that's not his fault. Look at those ridiculous stats and tell me that he shouldn't have been MVP that season.
Well Aaron Rodgers threw 38 touchdowns that season with only 5 interceptions and led the Packers to first in the NFC North with a 12-4 record.
Rodgers was good, but was buttressed by a potent Green Bay offense. J.J. Watt was the only good defensive player on Houston that season.
What about Brian Cushing and A.J. Bouye?
Brian Cushing is decent, but he hasn't made a Pro Bowl since 2009. A.J. Bouye wasn't as good then as he is now.
Even putting aside the talk of the 2014 season, he's too injury prone to warrant the praise.
He's injury prone because he pushes himself further than most players.
Please explain why the Texans advanced further last season into the playoffs with J.J. Watt on the bench due to injury than the previous five seasons.
It was because the AFC South is one of the worst divisions in the NFL and their first Wild Card Game was against the Oakland Raiders, who lost Derek Carr to injury the previous December.
Fair, although Houston's defense appeared to function just fine without Watt.
Well that was largely due to the emergence of Jadeveon Clowney following two years of poor play.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what about the Seahawks this year? Think they can get back the glory?
I think it all depends on how well Wilson plays.
That depends on if he has an offensive line this year.
Last year was brutal up front, but they did bring in some new guys.
I sure hope they can help. Maybe Jones can come out of retirement!
Why not? Marshawn Lynch went to the Raiders.
They're going to be really disappointed down in Las Vegas when he fumbles away half his touchdown chances.
The Raiders are still in Oakland for a couple of years. Lynch will retire again before they move.
He will be released well before then.
No,  he will be a beast down there with all those wild fans.
Who backs up Wilson this year?
You mean besides Ciara? I bet the Seahawks sign Colin Kaepernick.
That would be mistake in my opinion. His choking against Seattle was a good part of the Seahawks success in the Super Bowl years.
He may throw a lot of silly interceptions, but the guy can sure run.
Their backup from last year, Boykin,  can run also and would be a lot cheaper option.
Better to bring in a veteran. Too bad Robert Griffin III appears to be out of the picture.
Hopefully it is a moot point because Wilson is supposed to be in better shape this year.
He also has a big running back now to absorb some of this hits in the backfield.
Big is the key word. If Lacy balloons up to 260 pounds like last year when he was with Green Bay then nobody will be able to find Russell in his shadow.
His weight should not be a problem. The man is skinny now that his contract requires him to be or else no bonus money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL season is coming soon, are you excited?
I am very excited to see the start of Pre-season!
One of my favorite players in the NFL is Peyton Manning's brother, do you know him?
Peyton's brother plays for the New York Giants.
Eli Manning has been the Giants quaterback since 2004.
Do you recall his greatest game?
Who could forget Ei's greatest game and one of the greatest super bowls of all time.
Eli lead the Giants against argeuably the greatest comeback ever in Super Bowl in 2008.
During the Final minutes there were multiple lead changes.
The Giants ended up with the final posession of the game down by 4 points for one final drive.
With only seconds to go, they needed a touchdown to win and could not even tie it with a field goal.
The play I recall most was the great catch the wide reciever made, what was his name.
The Giants wide reciever Tyree made an almost impossible catch on fouth down!
Yes, with Eli about to be sacked, he made an incredible throw!
and then Tyree caught it on some defenders helmet one armed for the first down.
They would eventually score a touchdown and win the game.
That was Eli's first and only super bowl win as of today.
What made the game so great was that nobody expected them to have a shot at winning.
Yes, the Giants were a huge underdog to the Patriots.
Yes, Super Bowl XLII will remain one of the greatest games ever played!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite pro football team?
My team is the Miami Dolphins.
Wow, that is not a very popular or good team, what is your allegiance to them?
I grew up in south Florida, so it is my home team.  What is your favorite team?
I am a DC native, so naturally I am a Washington Redskins fan.
How do you feel about the name controversy, is Redskins an offensive name or not?
I think it is fine, it is a name, not a ridicule.
What are your thoughts about coach Jay Gruden?  Do you think he can turn that team into a winning one?
Redskins have had a rough go for many years.  I do not think Gruden, or RG3, or anyone person can fix that.
I feel you, same with Dolphins, we cannot go back to the good ole days of Schula or Marino.
Who do you think will make it to the playoffs this year?
I am favoring Sea Hawks and Broncos myself.
I too favor the sea hawks for the superbowl.
As long as it is not the Bills, the Cowboys or the Patriots, I will be happy!
Outside of the Redskins, I really do not care who goes.
You do not have a major rival you don't want to see in there?
I guess I would agree with you about the Cowboys and Patriots, but who cares about the Bills?
Buffalo is definetly a Miami Rival, although I do not think they have any chance of making it to the playoffs.
Well, I would really Like to see Redskins and Dolphins make it this year, that would be the miracle of the football season.
Yeah, I won't hold my breath.  Probably Patriots and Falcons again...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
Yes I am!
The first game is September 7th.
Who is playing?
The Chiefs versus the Patriots.
That should be an interesting matchup.
The Super Bowl champion Patriots will be looking to repeat.
They are an amazing franchise for sure.
They are, but I do like the Chiefs organization.
Me too. I think Andy Reid is a good coach.
He had a nice run with the Eagles and McNabb.
Those were some great years if you were and Eagles fan.
For sure, but they never got the big one!
That is true.
What are the Eagles chances this year?
I think they will be better, especially Carson Wentz.
Yes he should imporve from last year.
I think their defense was lacking last season.
You need a good defense to compete with all of the crazy offenses in the NFL.
Or you have to just outscore the other teams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the second best coach in the NFL?
That's an odd question.
Well it's because we all know who the best is.
Yeah, I guess you're right about that.  The Hoodie all the way.
Well I'm going to go with Mike McCarthy.
Yeah, he's been to a lot of playoffs.
Tied with New England for longest streak.
Yeah, that's good company.
Plus I think New England has more talent.
I can see that.  Green Bay finds a way to go deep every year even when they have a tough start.
They do.  Who else do you think is good?
Andy Ried has been good.
Yeah he has.  Talk about coaching with nothing.
Yeah, KC is just pretty solid and well coached.
Mike Tomlin too.
Yeah, Steelers always seem to be in the thick of things.
What about Pete Carroll.
Obviously he's been good.  Been to a couple Super Bowls recently.
Yeah, a lot of that was coaching.
And a good defense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait to see how Jamal Adams does on the Jets
I don't think that he will do too much. He is a rookie.
He is more than a rookie, he is a monster.
I don't think so. He seems alright.
I've been following since he started at LSU; trust me on this.
I do, but don't forget that this is not college football anymore.
That is true, but his dad played in the NFL.
Yeah, but his dad was a running back.
That is correct but his dad has the ability to share his experiences and give him tips.
Yeah, but only to an extent.
You're right but we will have to wait and see how he applies everything when he plays.
I think that he is promising, but I am more interested in watching Richard Sherman this season.
I did not use to like him; I have recently begun to respect him.
He is very smart and is able to create plays that may have not been plays at all.
How does he do that?
By watching football film and knowing the patterns of specific players.
Oh, okay. I wish he were faster.
Same. I have seeing him get beat on deep routes by extremely fast receivers.
That is the name of the game; you can't be good at everything.
That is true, but if I were in that position, I would be embarrassed
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does the NFL season start?
I think preseason starts early August.
I just checked, you are right the first game is Dallas vs. Arizona on August 3rd.
That is earlier than I thought.  Dallas is going to be good again this year.
I wonder if Dak Prescott will improve in his 2nd year.
He was really good as a rookie.  It will be hard to improve on that.
True, but he will be taking reps with the first team and have all the preparation time he didn't have last year.
That is a good point, and their O-Line and run game gives them great balance on offense.
What other teams do you think will be good this year?
The Patriots will be, they are always solid.
I agree, what about Carolina?  Do you think they can get it together.
I don't know, I was surprised they dropped off so much after a 15-1 regular season where they went to the Superbowl.
Cam Newton must have been injured or something, I think they can get back on track.
I would like to see it.  What about Seattle, they are always a contender.
They will be good, but with Lynch gone their run game has struggled and I'm not sure how Eddie Lacy will do.
Lynch is with the Raiders now, coming back out of retirement.
The Las Vegas Raiders, I wonder how he will be after not playing for a while.
Running backs tend to drop off quickly and go from dominant to unproductive very quickly.
Just ask Priest Holmes, LT or any of the others.
Agreed, I hope he does well though.  He is fun to watch with his running style and skittles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know anything about NFL records?
Some. Which ones in particular?
Well, I'm just wondering where the current quarterbacks stand with some of the passing records.
Oh, well I can tell you that both Drew Brees and Tom Brady are in the top five for passing yards.
Who is the leader?
Peyton Manning followed by Brett Favre.
Oh ok. What about passing touchdown?
That looks pretty similar. Manning, Favre, Brees, and Brady in that order.
Could Brees or Brady catch up?
It would probably take at least two more seasons, but I think they could.
Brady has the most wins though right?
He has the most career wins overall with 208, and Roethlisberger is the closest active quarterback, but he only has 136.
Wow, that is impressive.
It is. Brady also has the most regular season wins, playoff wins, and the second highest win percentage.
Who has a higher win percentage than him?
Otto Graham, but he only played five years. He has a 61-16 record.
So he has as many wins as Brady has losses?
Exactly.
Ok, so that's impressive, but of the quarterbacks with more years, Brady is the leader.
Yes, that is definitely true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My kid wants to do his term paper on the NFL but with a twist.
Suggest to him about choosing  some  weird facts to add in for interest.
Like in 1948, the Rams became the first team to have a helmet insignia. The distinctive Ram horns were hand-painted onto the helmets by the team’s halfback, Fred Gehrke.
Yeah see that's very cool.
I wonder if any of them still exist?
See that would be interesting to  know as well.
Fred The Hammer Williamson was the first Monday Night Football broadcaster to be fired before completing one season (1974). In fact, MNF fired Fred Williamson before the regular season even started.
Well that really blows. I don't think that's something I would want to be remembered for.
Former Steelers running back Jerome Bettis has bowled a perfect game of 300.
May be he should have been the quarter back instead!
Now these guys understand the NFL from several aspects. Dan Reeves, Tony Dungy and Mike Ditka have all appeared in Super Bowls as players, assistant coaches and head coaches.
That is impressive!
In 2006, controversial receiver Terrell Owens wrote a children's  book. Entitled Little T Learns to Share, the book teaches children the benefits of sharing.
So why would any body want a book someone who is a controversial role model?
That does seem a little disturbing doesn't it?
Maybe it was there way of making him not looking so bad.
The three bird mascots of the Baltimore Ravens are named Edgar, Allan and Poe.
That's almost lame.... but then appriPOE
Oh my word you need to have your head checked!
Naw I just need a good helmet and a padded room.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which teams made it to the playoffs last year?
Packers, Steelers, Falcons, and Patriots were in the final group
I wish the Packers could have gone all the way.
I love Aaron Rogers.
I hope this year is his year
Me too. I don't like the Falcons as much
Yeah Matt Ryan isn't as good a quarter back I don't think
I also don't like the Steelers or the Patriots
Yeah, neither of those teams excite me
I think the NFC South will have an interesting year
They were all pretty dismal last season.
For sure. The Saints were a dissapointment.
They beat the Panthers a few times
That's true. Cam Newton isn't quite there yet as a quarterback
He certainly can't compete with Drew Brees
He dresses way better though.
The man can certainly wear an outfit
I don't like Ron Rivera's transition lenses
I think they're kind of cool
I guess they're necessary for that outdoor stadium
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to see the Browns be good again
That is never going to happen
They are on the right track
Well they are tanking for sure
Plus they have a ton of draft picks
I mean they are doing the right thing just the wrong process
Osweiler could turn out to be OK
No he showed hes not a leader this year in Houston
Yeah I mean they overpaid him but I dont blame them
Its a classic backup QB case, happens all the time in the NFL
Who is the next one to be just like him
Mike Glennon in Chicago.
So you think Trubisky starts this year?
No I think they tank as well, again.
Wow but they still have to pay both of them
I dont think thats the issue
Trubisky is only on the rookie deal for a little bit
And sitting a year lowers his value.
If he was a trade commodity yes, but he isnt.
I think he lasts 3 years in Chicago and they draft a new quarterback
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your all-time favorite football player?
I loved Franco Harris.
Me too!
Are you from Pittsburgh?
Yes, how about you?
No, but I"m from Pennsylvania and we bleed black and gold.
Cool!
Have you been to any games this season?
Yeah, out in Pittsburgh.
Yeah, we went once too and even went to the science museum there as well.
Did you ever see them play the Bears?
Not in person but love to watch on TV.
I hope to get to that match-up this year.
When does the season start?
I think the first game is September 10th.
I can't wait.
Yeah, I hope they make it to the Superbowl.
Me too!
Should be another exciting season.
I hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when the Falcons too Ryan in 2008.
It's not your team's win lose record, that's for sure.
That's very true now that the NFL's two best quarterbacks get to go head to head.
I'm hoping hte Bears can improve.
Me too, but they probably won't do much without Manning.
I can't imagine.
Rodgers can be cast off as well.
That's an away game.
Sanchez is starting soon. I think he can turn the team around
Oh, I've seen all of the St Louis Games.
They started 3-1. At least they were competitive.
If he starts enough games, he can be top tier after this contract.
No, Brady's team has done multiple Super Bowls. What are Brady's acomplishments as a player?
It's like the new coach is being set up to fail.
Five years from now, Geno could easily get double what EJ makes five years from now.
It's a shame too. EJ's talent is wasted on the Bills.
That doesn't mean they should blow their entire budget on a rookie.
How on earthy do they strategize by rotating starters?
The Rams had four coaches in five seasons.
I agree, but I think it's a natural fear injured players have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to talk about football?
Sure i love it
Me too
Do you like the superbowl?
I love it
I like the game but i love the commercials
The commercials are great
They are so funny
Exactly
They are the best part of the superbowl
Exactly
But the game is great too
I love watching the game
The superbowl is just exciting on all levels
It really is
So much entertainment
Exactly
Even the halftime show is pretty great
Yes it is
Love it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Cowboys this year?
Great team as usual
Who is their star quarterback?
Tony Romo is not with them since becoming a free agent
They were trying to keep Kellen Moore as backup I think
Yeah Moore is just a little bit youger !
Maybe he will replace Tony Romo.
We will see.
Did the Cowboys have good stats in 2016
Yes, they have only a few losses
Your right, they lost twice to the Giants and once to the Eagles
That's pretty good, guess Romo gets the work done
Definitely, Dallas lost a really good player
Is he a free agent yet or no ?
Yes, I think he is switching to the Texans
Another Texan team huh?
Yeah. They will be lucky to get him
I think that, he's trying to make up his mind
Interesting to see what happens with that
I think Romo will be with the Texans
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you a fan of NFL football?
I am!
What's your favorite team?
Oh, my favorite team is the Saints.
The New Orleans Saints?
yeah, the black and gold.
Who is your favorite player on the Saints?
Drew Brees is my favorite player, but I love our Coach as well.
Who is the coach of the New Orleans Saints?
It's Sean Payton, and has been for awhile.
Do you think the Saints are going to go all the way this year?
Maybe, you just never know!
Have the Saints ever won the super bowl before?
yes, back in 2009.  We had an almost perfect season until they pulled the starters out at the end.
What are some teams you don't like?
I can't stand the Atlanta Falcons!
Didn't they almost win the Superbowl?
Yep, they blew a huge lead last year to the Patriots.
So do you like the Patriots?
I can't stand Bill Belichek and Tom Brady, so no.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you think anyone is going to challenge the PAtriots for the AFC crown?
Yes the Pittsburgh Steelers will be there again.
The Patriots have the Steelers number though.
True, but what does Brady have left to accomplish? Boredom might catch up at this point, and he is getting older.
They say thay every year about him...
True but every year he does get older.
I still dont see it, back to the superbowl with them.
Who will be going from the NFC?
The falcons will be back, they are going to be around for awhile.
Think they will recover from that disatourus 2nd half of the suoerbowl?
Yes, it will make them stronger and more determined.
Wll they were outplaying the Patriots for the first half, so all they need is that finish them mentality.
Agreed, killer instinct like the Patriots have.
do you think it will be a breeze for both teams
No  there is always some random team that surprises people.
In the NFC I like Tampa Bay's chances to be that team,
Good choice, yung up and coming team that showed flashes last year
What about the Bills?
What about the Bills?
LOL
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, the football will be on soon.
I can't wait! Tired of baseball and golf.
I watch five games a week.
I see as much as I can.
We got robbed in that Seattle game!
That Russell Wilson got lucky. He can't really pass.
He passed enough that game!
He's more of a college player.
We probably won't play them this year. Carolina is getting better.
Another running quarterback.
Cam Newton? He actually is a good player.
We can beat them. I don't know about Atlanta, though.
Yeah, that Super Bowl was crazy!
We need to shore up our defense by then.
A good offense is a good defense.
Those recievers are all getting bigger and bigger.
You hit them low and they go down.
They got new rules now; you can't do that anymore.
They should let the players play.
This isn't the 50's anymore; they had to do something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
American or European?
American
It's fun to watch!
What's your favorite team?
Oh I don't have one
Not a huge fan then?
Nah, I'm from Germany and it's not common over in Europe
Fair enough
But I know that they are starting to have some games over there
Yea they're trying to get Europe more into football
Oh we're into "football"
Yea, but that's not "our" kind of "football"
Haha! I know, I know!
Did you watch the game when they played in Europe?
Nope!
Why not?
Too far away for me
Oh, yea I guess that might have been a bit far for you
Yea, maybe next time
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, have you done anything fun in the past few months?
Not really, although this past November I went to a New York Jets game finally.
Cool! Was that the first one that you have went to before?
It sure was; living so far away from there makes it really difficult to go to the games in person.
I am sure your work schedule makes it tough as well, right?
No doubt about it, I am a true fan though, so I always make time to watch their games on television.
What do you think their chances are for this upcoming season?
I am really excited with the direction the Jets are headed right now actually.
That is a different tone than most Jet fans that I talk to. I am impressed!
Well I think the coaching staff has been vastly improved over what it used to be.
Does that mean that you were not a fan of Rex Ryan?
Not really; I thought he should have done a lot better than what he did.
He did take them to two straight AFC championship games in a row with Mark Sanchez.
I know, but it was all down hill from there. Let's just say, I was glad when he was let go.
How do you feel about Todd Bowles?
Well he got off to a great start, winning ten games in his first season.  The next year was not so great though.
Are you still optimistic about him?
I really am! I feel that he will have a great season this upcoming year. Plus, we have a new offensive coordinator that I am excited about.
I did not know that, who is the new coordinator?
His name is John Morton and I think he will be really successful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A lot of NFL players do some great things for charity, but you sometimes don't hear much about it.
I know, Drew Brees has a Brees Dream foundation that helps kids with cancer. That's a great cause!
A lot of them like to help with kid's charities. Larry Fitzgerald from the Cardinals has a kid's foundation that helps kids in crisis.
Andy Dalton from the Bengals has a foundation that helps kids in the hospital. He does a lot of fundraisers.
JJ Watt from the Houston Texans has a charity for middle school kids helping them with sports.
It seems like everyone likes to help kids when it comes to charity.
Yeah, that and the military. Vincent Jackson from the Buccaneers has a charity for veterans.
People feel like we owe vets the support because they get injured protecting all of us.
One player even supports police and police dogs. Ben Roethlisberger from the Steelers.
Police often owe their lives to those dogs, it's good to see someone thinking of them.
Yeah, most people do center on kids though. Jay Cutler from the Bears has a foundation that helps kids with diabetes.
I think children with diseases touches people because these kids should have their whole life ahead of them.
Tim Tebow has a foundation that helps build kid's playrooms in hospitals. I'm sure getting to be a kid helps them deal with the stress.
It seems strange that kids these days come down with so many different diseases.
Brandon Marshall from the Bears had borderline personality disorder, and started a foundation to help kids with it.
It's good to see people finally talking about mental illness and doing something about it, instead of hiding it.
I like how all these NFL players use their fame and fortune to turn around and do good deeds that help so many others.
I know, they don't get enough credit. The media always talks about actor's charities, but never much about athlete's charities.
I think it's important to publicize charity work, because a lot of people don't know how to help, and learning more about a foundation can give them little ways they can help.
I know what you mean, if people just realized what great things a fundraiser does, and how someone they admire is involved, they might be more willing to participate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready for football this year?
I sure am! I have my DVR set to record all the preseason games too.
Which team are you rooting for this year?
I always root for the Atlanta Falcons.
Me too! That's my home team.
Julio Jones is a beast and Matt Ryan has gotten so much better.
Yes. Dan Quinn really whipped them into shape.
Who do you think will make it to the Superbowl with them?
Maybe the Denver Broncos. They are also good.
They no longer have Peyton Manning so they may not be as great this year.
True. I can't wait until the September 17th game where the Falcons play against the Greenbay Packers.
Why is that?
The Greenbay Packers is my best friend's team. I want the Falcons to crush them!
The Falcons did beat them last year so I am sure they will beat them again this year.
Which game are you most excited to see this season?
The December 7th game when the Atlanta Falcons go against the New Orleans Saints.
Oh yea! That's going to be a good game since they are divisional rivals!
We are having a football party that day at my place to watch the game. Would you like to come?
Sure! What time should I be there?
Come around 6pm so we can pregame before the real game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think football is so popular?
Like, NFL football, college football, football in general?
I guess NFL football.
Well, I think I know a few reasons why.
It's a classic American staple.
Yes, when people think of America they think of football.
Well, "American football" at least.
Yeah, but everyone loves the NFL because of what it can stand for.
What do you mean?
It brings everyone together under a purpose, which is the sport.
Okay, true.
It always has a schedule that everyone knows and it's been around forever.
Almost 100 years!
Exactly, its so popular.
And a lot of players are very talented and regarded as heros.
Agreed, because of how great they are at the sport.
Plus, people love sports because they love rooting for a team.
Yep, that's why people get so invested in it.
So many people just love football.
With good reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that the Chargers are moving to Los Angeles?
Yeah, that's really crazy. It must suck for San Diego fans.
Yeah. I don't even know why Los Angeles would need two teams.
It's one of the biggest cities in America. You don't think they can handle two professional NFL teams?
I don't think so. I just don't really see LA being that big of a football city.
Well, they did have the Rams and Raiders before.
Yeah, and look what happened. Both teams moved out of the city.
You think that could happen again in the future?
Yeah, definitely. I think LA fans get bored of football and would rather watch baseball or basketball.
Maybe the franchises see a new popularity for footbball in the city. That's why they relocating there.
I heard that the ticket sales for the Rams first season in LA didn't really go that well.
Maybe it was because they weren't very good.
Maybe. But you would think, if there was a strong need for football, the fans would support a new team there regardless.
I think that people need to give it a few years before they determine that the poor ticket sales are going to be a constant thing for the Rams.
I just see it being a disaster. And with the Charger moving there, it's going to be even worse.
I do wonder how the fans are going to decide which team to be a fan of.
Probably going to depend on which team is better. I just feel bad for San Diego fans.
Yeah, must be horrible to realize that your team is moving away after decades of support.
That's why I can't stand sports sometimes. No loyalty.
Making money sometimes isn't about loyalty.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Think Adrian Peterson is going to be good on the Saints?
He had most of last season off he should be ok if he's healthy.
Having him should help Bres a lot too.
I don't know if they even need him to be the main part of the offense they have Ingram too.
Yeah he can get a little less carries but be healthy for the whole season.
They got him for a decent price too.
It seemed nobody wanted to take a chance on him.
The Vikings wanted to move on and I don't blame them.
They got a few good players now. They picked up a free agent too didn't they?
Yeah they got Murray from the Raiders.
He should give them a boost for sure.
With Lynch coming back the raiders didn't need him anymore.
Peterson should be fine though I think he works hard enough.
Eventually he's going to wear down though he's past 30 already.
Look at frank Gore though, he's over 30 and still going.
He's not what he once was though.
The colts are saying he's going to be the starter still though.
They need to look for a younger RB.
They will find one soon they need to help out Luck.
If they had a good running game they would be a really good team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which running backs will have great seasons in the NFL in 2017?
I think Marshawn Lynch will have a resurgence.
What makes you say that?
New team and new scenery.
But he is getting pretty old, right?
Yes, but he has somewhat low mileage considering.
That is debatable, but I think I see your point.
Who do you believe will have a great season?
Watch out for Eddy Lacy this year.
We will see, he needs to stay healthy.
Yes he does, but I think that if Jamaal Charles stays healthy, he will be great.
He has always been great.
But again, he needs to stay healthy.
I agree - that is the only thing that will prevent him from success.
He used to have the most yards per rush attempt in NFL history.
Yes he was a beast coming into the league.
It's a shame what has happened to his knees.
Yes, but hopefully he can return to prominence.
It's tough to come back from those injuries.
Yes it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you ever hear about the deflating scandal?
no? what is it?
the deflating scandal, where they were caught deflating their footballs.
no, which team was it?
i believe it was the patriots.
of course, one of biggest teams in the NFL.
yep, it was a huge thing years ago.
how did the NFL catch onto them?
probably heard a conversation about it or something.
yeah, and someone ratted the team out.
or, an NFL official could've just noticed a deflated ball and their possession.
true, and then decided to persue it.
i can't believe they were dumb enough to try and get away with it.
well what are the advantages to deflating balls?
i'm no expert but it's probably easier to play with them.
really? i would imagine it would be harder.
well i'm assuming if they are different than official weighted balls the other teams would'nt be able to handle them properly.
i guess that makes sense, well what happened to the team?
i think they were banned from a whole season.
serves them right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright we discussed Julio Jones and Odell Beckham Jr. but where does Antonio Brown fall into this?
Antonio Brown I would have right there with Julio Jones.
In my opinion I think Antonio Brown is a better wide receiver. He's a lot more dynamic on the field.
I think they're tied in talents and ability and I don't think many will argue one is far better than the other they're both the top wide receivers today.
The Pittsburgh Steelers are always so consistent year in and year out.
They really are except they can't seem to avoid the big injury.
You mean the Big Ben injuries.
Yeah Ben Roethlisberger is so tough but he always falls to unfortunate injuries that dampens their hopes.
Ben is a top quarterback in this league, he's a Superbowl champ. He has awesome weapons on the offense and the Steelers always seem to reload their offense for him every year.
What's the current word on Le'veon Bell?
He's still holding out and there's the contract situation going on.
I hope they work that out because the Steelers can't afford to lose Le'veon Bell.
I agree. I can't see the Steelers not making it work. Bell is too valuable for them to not go after.
Imagine if Bell went to the Ravens.
That would be heartbreaking for all the Steeler fans. He would go to one of their most hated rivals.
Do you think the Steelers can challenge the Patriots this year?
I think they can if they get Bell back!
Big Ben needs to stay healthy too and Antonio Brown too.
I really enjoy Steeler games because of the action and offensive excitement. It wouldn't be the same if Bell left.
I'm hoping he stays! We'll see in time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you watch the super bowl?
I sure did watch it.
What did you think about it?
It was one of the greatest super bowls of all time. What about you?
I thought that it was the best example of a team never quitting.
Yes I would have to agree. Tom Brady has ice water veins.
He really does show what hard work and stone cold determination can do for a competitor.
Yea, it was laughable that the Falcons actually lost
Yea they played very cocky after getting a big lead early.
Yup. You can never stop playing when the stakes are that high.
Do you think both teams will make it back there next season?
I think that the Patriots will make it back but I am not sure about the Falcons.
I have the same thinking. That was a mentally defeating loss that could spill over to the future.
It is really up in the air at the end of the day. I would hate to have to go through something like that.
I know what you mean. I am super competitive and it hurt just to watch a team like that.
I tend to think you get what you put into it when it comes to football.
I can agree with that. Who do you think will make instead of the Falcons then.
I think the Packers will face off against the Pats.
Oh that is a good one. I can't wait to see it if it happens.
Yea they are my favorite team so I always think they are gonna go and win it all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Lions will do this season?
I think they might make the playoffs but only if the key players stay healthy.
That's a big if - they already lost their best offensive lineman in practice.
You're talking about the left tackle, right?  He'll be back at some point and I think they got someone decent to fill in.
I'm not sure about that.  Left tackle is a key position because it protects the quarterback's blind side.
That's true enough.  And Matthew Stafford has taken his share of hits over the years.
Speaking of Stafford, with Calvin Johnson retired he really needs to spread the ball around more.
The big missing element is a consistent running game to compliment that passing game.
Last year their best running back missed most of the season and the running game was mediocre at best.
I agree.  And the problem with that is that other teams can focus on stopping that passing game rather than worry about both.
Abudullah is their best runner and he's coming back this season and looking good so far.
Trouble is that he's prone to injury although when he's healthy he is a real threat.
What about the other side of the ball - how's is the defense looking?
They need to develop a consistent pass rush to be effective.
That's true.  Their defensive ends were missing in action last year.
Yeah, I don't know what happened with Ziggy Ansah but he was a disappointment last year.
The secondary has improved over the last couple years but never can get the job done against the best quarterbacks like Tom Brady.
That's why the pass rush is so important because it helps the defensive backs when the quarterback is under pressure.
Well if they can pull all the elements together they have a good shot at the playoffs with the schedule they have.
And once you're in the playoffs you're only a few wins away from the Super Bowl, which would be a first for the Lions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go to a Atlanta Falcons game this year?
Yes. For sure.
The new stadium is going to be awesome.
I know I am so excited.
Did you ever go to a game in the dome?
Yes, I went last year. It was so much fun.
There is nothing like being at a live sporting event.
I agree, and NFL football is my favorite.
There is so much enthusiam.
Exactly. We didn't even win that game, but I still had a blast.
I completyly understand.
Yeah, just being there makes the loss seem less painful.
I will work on getting us some tickets.
That sounds great.
I will let you know some date and pricing options.
Perfect. I am up for pretty much whenever.
Great. I will check my work schedule.
I don't work weekends or nights at all.
Okay. Good to know.
Thank you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Things just don't feel right in my life unless its football season, how about you?
Uh yeah I live in Texas we eat breathe and sleep football here
Oh wow Texas huh?  So are you a Cowboys fan?
No actually I like the Cowboys but my family comes from Ohio, and I have grown up a Browns fan
Haha, oh sorry to hear that, Lol
Yeah I know its been rough, but they are rebuilding
They haven't had a good team since the Bernie Kosar Years in the mid 80's
Thats true but they have had a lot of draft picks recently and we feel optimistic that things will change under head coach Hugh Jackson.
Do you go to a lot of games?
I've been to about 10 NFL games in my whole life, including Browns staudium, soldier field and NRG Stadium
Nice, I've been to five games, all in Kansas City where we live.
Do you own a lot of Kansas city Chiefs memorabilia like jerseys and clothes?
Yes I do.   Do you think the NFL is more popular than ever?
I really do, I feel like NFL gets better TV ratings than any other sport and the super bowl is like a national holiday
Do you think ticket prices are too expensive?
Its pretty expensive to attend a game especially when you factor in other costs like parking and food, and uh, .... beer!
DId you hear that Las Vegas is getting a team
Yes I think its very cool that the Oakland Raiders are moving there, how exciting NFL football In Vegas!
It was nice chatting man, I will look for you on TV when I see the Chiefs playing at HOme :)
For sure you to, and GO BROWNS BABY!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to join my fantasy football league?
Of course. I'm excited about the new season. Can't wait
Ok, I'll send you the details via email. I can't wait for the season to start either.
I'll be going to training camp to watch Tom Brady practice with Brandin Cooks
That team is off the charts this year.
I know. I'm really excited. I might draft Brady in Round 1
Haha. You are such a homer.
You'll regret saying that when he puts up 50 points every week.
Yea, we'll see about that.
Brady is going to be legit.
You really think so at his age?
Dude, he didn't show any signs of slippage last year. He's playing like he's 30
I think Rodgers is the better bet at QB. He always is for fantasy purposes
Maybe. He does have Martellus Bennett this year. Would be a great superbowl matchup with the Patriots
Is that your prediction for this year's superbowl? Pack vs. Patriots?
Ummm, yea I think so. Falcons will have Superbowl loss hangover.
I agree with you. AFC has no contenders to match the Patriots. They just got better and unless injuries hit, they should be good to go.
Yep. If Gronk is healthy in the playoffs, game over for everyone else.
It would be a good game. Rodgers vs. Brady
I can't even imagine what people would say if Brady beat Rodgers. There would have to be no more doubt from anyone whatsoever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favourite NFL team?
Probably the Cowboys. I guess.
What do you mean I guess?
Well, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with them.
Why do you hate them?
I don't like their owner; he fired my favourite coach.
Oh yeah? Who was he?
Well, it was 30 years ago. It was Tom Laundry.
Dang, you can certainly hold a grudge. Why was he fired?
They weren't satisfied with his record, I guess.
Oh. So why did you like him?
I thought he was smart, and I appreciated that he made his athletes behave themselves.
Was he the main reason you loved them?
No, there were a lot of things. I like their quarterback, among others.
So it was a players thing?
Well, honestly, when I was five years old the biggest thing was that I liked their uniforms.
Really? That's adorable.
I thought it was cool that they had a star, and they were cowboys, and stuff.
That is pretty enticing for a five year old.
Yeah. So, I guess I mostly like them for who they were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick a DT to build around, who would it be?
Well, I wouldn't take a DT if I were building a team.
It's a hypothetical question.
I know, but DT is not a position I would do.  I would always start with a QB or pass rusher.
Alright, I get it, but since you can't answer the question, I'll go first.
Fine, smart guy, who are you taking?
Aaron Donald.
Great young player for sure.  Seems like he's a forgotten man in LA.
Only because his team is so bad.
Yeah, the Rams are eternally awful.
Donald just plays hard every turn.  I knew he was a star the moment he was drafted.
I was hoping for him to fall in the draft to my team, but it didn't happen.
Anyway, that's my pick.
You're forgetting one little guy I think though.
Who am I forgetting?
Some guy named JJ Watt.
Oh man, I did forget JJ.
If he hadn't been hurt last year, he'd be a slam dunk pick.
Yeah, will be interesting to see how he comes back from injury.
When healthy, best player in the league in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am ready to watch some football!
Well the NFL will be here before you know it.
Trust me, I have been counting down the days!
What team do you cheer for?
I am a Buffalo Bills fan all the way!
Were you around when they lost four straight Superbowl's?
I sure was, those four years were probably the most heartbreaking years of my life in terms of being a sports fan.
I am sure they were rough to get through. What was the hardest part about all of those games?
I think the hardest part was just being so close and still never getting over the hump.
Do you ever the think the Bills will ever get back to being that good?
I am not sure. I do not think we will ever go to four straight Superbowl's again.
I am not sure if any team will ever go to four straight again.
You are probably right about that actually. I would love just to get to the playoffs for now!
I am sure you would. Who was your favorite player from those teams?
I loved Thurman Thomas and Bruce Smith. Those guys were just tough as nails.
I always thought Bruce Smith was the heart of those teams.
Yea, he was a great player for sure. There were some great talent on those teams.
Maybe if it were not for another guy with the last name of Smith, things could have worked out differently.
I think you are talking about Emmitt Smith?
I sure am! The best running back of all time in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow the NFL preseason is only about a month away. Time flew this offseason.
Yuck, it will be the same old teams winning, all the ones I hate again.
Come on now, your Vikings showed some potential last year, at least early on.
Yeah, but they ended up jinxed as usual. Nothing changes.
Well who do you see winning the divisions this year?
I'd say Patriots, Steelers, Texans, Raiders, Cowboys, Packers, Buccaneers and Cardinals
Whoa...Buccaneers?
Yeah, I think the Falcons will go in a tailspin after their massive choke job. Still mad about that by the way.
Yeah, why do other teams always choke and do the stupidest things against the organization that is always up to something suspicious. Weird.
Buccaneers were pretty good at the end of last year. Winston was coming into his own.
You think Seahawks won't win NFC West?
That was a toss-up..I thought the Cardinals caught too much bad luck last year.
Yeah, it's bound to reverse itself, but I don't trust Palmer anymore.
My one buddy from San Diego is convinced the Chargers will do well now that they've left, just to spite him.
They'll lose 60 percent of their starters to injury like usual, but still average 30 points a game...
And go 5-11 with eight losses in the final minute.
I'm going Cowboys over Raiders for the Super Bowl.
That would be a popular game to watch no doubt. I think both those teams are going to step back though.
Well who do you see winning the Super Bowl?
Gonna go Patriots over Packers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who do you thnk is the GOAT?
Well I know the media will tell you Tom Brady but I think thats debatable
agreed
who would you say is the best of all time
I would say top 5 would start with Brett Favre
and then?
probably Dan Marino
yeah I loved the Dolphins who else?
Payton Manning for sure would be another one
yeah he is really good in those Papa John commercials
lol yes he is, I would probably also include Big Ben
okay I can see where you are coming from but that guy is a jerk
yeah I am doing this on gameplay only not on how they are as a person
okay so include Big Ben who would be the last of the top 5
I would say Aaron Rodgers
Yeah Aaron is good but I think Eli Manning should be included
honestly?  why him he's not that good
Here is why he has 2 superbowl rings and can turn it on when he needs too
yeah he for sure has more rings than his brother
I know right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Has the league ever had this many good receivers?
Seems like it's a very deep group of players.
You could probably make a case for 4 or 5 guys being the best.
Not sure it would go that high, but there's some great ones for sure.
Alright, so who's your #1?
He had a breakout year last year and he's uncoverable.
Ok.  And who is that?
Julio Jones.  He was outstanding last year.
I can buy that.  Probably his best year ever.
It helps that Matt Ryan had his best year so Jones was able to capitalize.
He's just so big, I mean how do you cover that?
It's kind of the problem that they used to have with Calvin Johnson in his prime.
I might give the edge to Antonio Brown there.
Over Julio?  Nah, but he'd probably be my #2.
Nobody runs routes like Brown and his speed burns everyone.
I feel like Julio does the same, but is four inches taller.
Brown is more quick.  He jumps in his cuts much better.
Whereas Jones is probably the better red zone target.
All I'm saying is I'm throwing a hail mary, it's going to Brown.
And for me, Julio's grabbing that sucker in traffic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do the Rams play?
They play in St. Louis
Cool. Are they good?
They are decent. They were a lot better when they had Kurt Warner
Is Warner still playing?
No
They are one of my favorite teams.
Who else do you like?
I love the Titans.
I like them too
I miss their old team with McNair.
He was a really good QB
Yeah he was fun to watch
Do you prefer the older teams?
Yes, I miss the Randy Moss days
He was great on the Vikings
He really was. I also miss Madden
The video game?
No, the coach
Oh. I loved him as a coach.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the greatest NFL team of all time?
I don't know.  There were so many of them.
Yeah there are a bunch of them.
You have the Packers of the 60s.
You have the Steelers of the 70s.
You also have the Cowboys in the 70s.
Then you have the 49ers of the 80s.
You also have the 1985 Chicago Bears.
Yeah.  In the 1990s, you have the Cowboys.
In the 2000's, you have New England.
Yeah there are a bunch of good teams.
If I had to pick, I would pick the Patriots when they had Randy Moss.
When they went undefeated in the season until the Super Bowl?
Yeah.
Yeah, they good be it.
The players evolve so much.
They evolve better too.
The nutrition, workouts, and diets are all better now.
Yeah everyone is more efficient and trying everything to get an edge.
It is the rate of development of going to the next level.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So pumped for the NFL coming back.
After last season I can't wait for a new champion.
Are you tired of the Patriots?
Don't get me wrong, they are a good team, but I rather someone else win.
You mean like your Rams?
Oh man, that would be the day, but that is not happening any time soon.
Yeah I know, well they will have a bright future.
Hopefully, I just hope that Goff can become an NFL level quarterback.
I am sure he will do good, he should have learned a lot while sitting.
Yeah, but I kind of wish we took Carson Wentz, he looks like he will be legit.
He's good, but who knows, Goff hasn't had a real chance to shine yet.
That is what I worry about, he hasn't beat out the current quarterback ahead of him.
Well some players need more time to be ready.
I guess so, I just don't think he is the second coming of Aaron Rodgers.
Well that is a tough model to live up to.
Yeah, well all I can do is hope for the best.
I'm rooting for you.
Say, do you want to go to a Rams game this season? I can get tickets.
I would totally be down for it.
Cool, I will let you know once I get the tickets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the position of running back is a dying breed?
Yeah for the most part.
I mean you have your Ezekiel Elliots in the league
No I think he is one of a kind
Oh for sure but I meant like there are probably a handful of every down back
What do you think is the reason for that?
I am not sure maybe the league has gone to a passing league.
Yeah that could be the culprit
And I dont think teams see value in a bruising guy holding the ball
They did it for plenty of years.
So would you ever draft one high?
No I think you need to get your RB in the 3rd round of the draft.
So how do you justify taking one in the top 5.
I guess if he is generational
But thats all based on conjecture isnt it?
The entire draft is predicated on that.
So Elliot was worth the investment, right?
Yeah but theres always the 2nd year slump
Could you see that happening to him
With his line in front of him it would be hard
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite sport to watch on the weekend?
Haha are you talking about Football.
Yeah, I got to ask it like that so people don't get offended.
People get offended when we talk about Football, really now.
Yeah. I mostly watch NFL football.
Me too! Are you excited for the next season?
Yeah, I am very much am.
Did you watch the draft?
Of course I did. the talent this year seem to be very great.
Me too.
I will be rooting for the Houston Texans.
Ohh do you like Clemson?
Yeah and Deshaun Watson is my favorite player.
Haha, He played very well.
Yeah and he can make a lot of play, rushing and passing.
Yeah, with all this rookie, I want to see how great the Patriots can play again these other teams.
I think the veterans will taught these rookies a thing or two about the game.
Yeah, with that come back, anyone is going to want to learn from them.
Yeah,I think this next season is going to be great.
Same here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey how do you think the Bengals will do this season?
I think they will have a bounce back year
Why do you think that?
They have a much easier schedule than last year
They also had a good draft
Yeah I am excited to see what Ross and Mixon can do.
They also have some picks from last year that are healthy
Yeah Billings is a big guy that can eat up space
I am still not sure if Marvin Lewis can get the job done
We really need to win a playoff game
Dalton has played bad in the playoffs too.
Yeah he locks in on AJ Green too much
Are you going to any games this year?
I would like to go to the home opener to start the season
Who do you think will have a big year for fantasy football
I really like Leveon Bell and Brandin Cooks
Tom Brady is going to hit Cooks early and often
The Patriots have a lot of weapons. They will be tough to stop
I also like AJ Green as the #1 receiver. He keeps getting better and better
If he is the #1 receiver than the Bengals will have a great year
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Tom Brady win the Heisman trophy last year?
I take it you don't watch football a lot.
Why do you say that? Isn't Tom Brady one of the best players in the NFL?
Yes, exactly. The Heisman isn't awarded in the NFL.
I'm pretty sure the Heismas is for football, isn't it?
It is, but for college football. NFL is the professional league.
What is the name of the trophy or prize that the best player in the NFL wins?
It's called the Associated Press Most Valuable Player award.
Who is the current holder?
Well you were right on the money about that part, because Tom Brady is the current MVP.
What other awards are there?
Well of course there's the Superbowl trophy. It's called the Vince Lombardi trophy.
Who is Vince Lombardi? Was he a great player?
He was actually a coach I believe. One of the best coaches in the league.
Nice. What about rings - do all the players get rings like they do in NBA?
Yes they do. The losing team as well.
Are any of these cash prizes?
No, I don't think cash is involved. Just the honor.
And of course they can probably negotiate their contracts for higher pay if they have received one of these awards.
I'm sure, it's very presitigious
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who is your favorite NFL team and why?
I've always liked the Minnesota Vikings for some reason, starting when Fran Tarkenton was the QB.
So, how do you think they will do this year?
I think they will win like 10 games and win their division.
Why do you think the Vikings will win 10 games?
Well, they have a good QB, Sam Bradford, signed two new offensive lineman in the offseason, and drafted a center from Ohio State in the 3rd round of college draft.
So, who do they play in their fist game?
They play the New Orleans Saints on Monday Night football
So, who do you think is the best team in their league?
I think the Atlanta Falcons would have to be s favorite to go to the Super Bowl again.
Yeah, Matt Ryan is a great QB. So, who do think is the best QB?
I don't like Green Bay, but I always hate facing Aaron Rodgers with his rocket arm
Which NFL team has the best defense?
I think it's usually like these two teams, Seattle and Baltimore.
So, who do think will play Atlanta in the next Super Bowl
Unfortunately, you have to choose Bill Belichick and the New England patriots.
So, why did you say ' unfortunately '?
Because I'm tired of the same teams winning every year. Let a team like the Browns sneak in lol
Finally, who is your favorite NFL player of all time?
My favorite NFL player to ever watch was Fran Tarkenton of the Vikings many years ago.He was very exciting and could both scramble and throw, way before a Johnny Manzell arrived.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would be your dream match up in the 2018 Superbowl?
Any two teams, no division restrictions?
Yes, two teams that you would like to see play each other.
present day teams, I would love to see the Saints take on Atlanta Falcons
Saints versus Falcons, really? Who would you root for?
The Saints, but I don't think they would win.
Why is that?
The Falcons 2017 team are hungry and looking for redemption after the theft of the 2017 Superbowl against the patriots.
How did they steal the game?
Seriously? The patriots looked asleep until the fourth quarter.
But Tom Brady still showed up in the end.
true, but there for a minute I had to wonder if he was throwing the game, cause he sure wasn't throwing the ball!
I think the Falcons will do alright this year, their offense is fierce.
The only thing I would have them work on would be special teams.
I agree, special teams is where the game is often won or lost.
Definately need a solid second string field goal kicker
Who do you like coming up thru the ranks?
If it were me, I would take a long look at OU
Why OU?
They consistantly have strong players with a solid skill foundation and play well under pressure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you want to join my NFL Fantasy Football League?
Yea!  I can't wait for the season to start!
Me neither!
When is your Fantasy draft?
It will be in mid-August, I'll send you an email invite when we have the date settled.
Sounds good!  Who are you liking this year?
I still think Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers are the best pics for QB?  What do you think?
Yea, definitely Rodgers for sure!
You know I'm a die-hard Texan, I hope JJ Watt can keep it together this year!
Agreed!  He's the best DE in the league if he can stay free of injury.
What do you think of the Jags this season?
You know I'm from Jacksonville so I have a soft spot for the Jaguars but I honestly don't have much hope for them.
Yea but they did pick up Ramsey, I think he will be a solid player.
Yea I think so too, Myles Jack was also a good pick-up for them.
Jack is good, I just worry about him with injuries.
True, if he stays healthy though he should be solid.
I still don't see them getting anywhere near the Super Bowl though, they just can't seem to hold it together for an entire season.
Unfortunately I have to agree with you, some major changes have to happen in Jacksonville for them to ever get to a Super Bowl.
Well, I'll let you know about the draft.
Thanks man, looking forward to it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like the Colts this year?
Kind of mixed on them to be honest.
Really?  Seems like they could break out.
To me, they've been a disappointment as of late.
I remember thinking a few years ago that they would be perennial contenders.
Right, but Andrew Luck is a bit overrated.
It seems like everyone slotted him to be the best thing since white bread.
They did, but he's arguably not even a top ten QB in the league.
Maybe they just gave him too much credit to fast.
He's got some good receivers though.
Yep.  I love me some TY Hilton.
That dude is a jitterbug for sure.
And they have speed on the opposite side too.
Yeah, that guy who played at Miami.
Phillip Dorsett is his name.  Arguably the fastest pair of receivers in the league.
Isn't their defense suspect though?
It's not the greatest.  I think they signed a lot of free agents this year.
I do like Vontae Davis though.
Yeah, a bit of a down year last year, but a good player.
They stole that guy from Miami.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how long do you think Brady will play for?
I don't know.  What do you think?
He says he wants to play until 45.
Yeah.  I don't think he will be able to.
I don't know.  He is 40 now.
Five years is a long time.
He had an incredible season at age 39.
He missed 4 games though.
It wasn't due to injury though.
Yeah, but it is still less hits to his body.
He eats well and get to bed early every night.
The decline happens fast though.  Look at Peyton Manning.
Yeah, but he had neck surgery.
True, but it could happen to Brady.
I don't think he has been hurt since he broke his leg over a decade ago.
Yeah, but if he does get hurt the body doesn't heal itself as good and fast at that age.
Yeah.  He is usually able to get the ball out quick so he doesn't get hit a lot.
I don't think New England will keep him for 5 years.  He might get traded.
He might with their good backup there.
Yeah, New England doesn't want to pay big money for a guy to sit on the bench so one of them will have to go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Super Bowl? Crazy game right?!
It was absolutely nuts. I cannot believe that the Falcons let the Patriots back into the game.
I was certain that the Falcons had the game won going into the fourth quarter.
As was I. I feel really bad for Falcons fans around the world.
Tom Brady may be the best quarterback to ever play the game.
I think you are right about that. I do not know any other quarterback that could have manufactured a comeback in a game like that.
When the game went to overtime and the Patriots won the toss I knew that the game was over.
Yeah, the Falcon's defense was gassed by then and the Patriots just marched down the field for the win.
I was at a party watching the game with a couple Falcons fans and they were in complete disbelief.
I can imagine so. I would be devasted if that happened to my team.
I feel bad for Matt Ryan. He played a great game and now he will be remembered for this loss.
Yeah I agree. I am happy for hi that he won MVP for the year.
Yeah he had a fantastic season and the offense was on fire all year long.
I did hear that their offensive coordinator is expected to take a head coaching job in Los Angeles.
Yeah I he is expected to sign with the Los Angeles Rams. Good move you think?
It's hard to say because he had a rough first year in Atlanta but then had a great year this year.
We will have to wait and see how they draft because they have a lot of needs.
They sure do need a lot of depth on both sides of the ball.
I am sad the NFL season is over. What will I do on Sundays now?
I know it always seems like weeks go slower when there is no football. I guess we will just have to wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like Houston this year?
I'm mixed on them.  Some pros and cons.
Give me some pros first.
Okay.  Well, you get JJ Watt back.
Huge plus in my opinion.  Best defensive player in the NFL.
When healthy, sure, but he's been really banged up as of late.
I also think they'll be better at QB.
Really?  I think that was a con.
Getting rid of Osweiler is always a plus.
It was crazy how they traded him to the Browns.
They signed him to a ridiculous contract.
And he was awful!  Horrible move.
But he's not on their books anymore so it doesn't matter.
But QB is a con for me because of what they have.
Tom Savage is the starter.
Yeah, and he's just a guy.  They're waiting on the future.
You mean how they drafted Watson?
Right.  I like Watson, think he can be a good pro, but it's going to take time.
He probably starts maybe a year or so away.
They need to get some better weapons for the QB regardless of who starts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whose your favorite NFL team?
That has to be the Lions.
Why the Lions?
Well mostly because they were my dads team growing up so it was natural for me to grow attached to them as well.
Whose your favorite player on the Lions?
Barry Sanders.
Now I understand.
He was a unique Running Back and outplayed everyone on the field.
His skill was beyond that of the players back then and likely still would be today.
I can't agree more he was a good Running Back.
I still remember watching the games back then and seeing him run from one side to the other of the field over and over until he found a gap to run through.
He could run and juke all day.
There was just something about his character that drew me to him as well.
He was a special running back that's for sure.
Do you think anyone compares to him now?
Not really but some are close?
Which one?
Adrian Peterson runs like him at times.
He is very good but also just runs liek a tank at times too.
Yep, he doesn't just rely on speed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to name one, who would you say is the all time best football player ever?
I would say Joe Montana.
Didn't he play for the San Francisco 49ers?
He did.
He's won a Superbowl before, right?
While with the 49ers he won four of them.
Four? That's amazing!
It really is. Not only that, but he was name MVP three different times.
What an honor. Did you ever see him play?
I did a few times in San Francisco many years ago.
Why did he stop playing for them?
He had an injury and once his injury got better, he traded to play with the Kansas City Chiefs.
Is he still playing for them?
Oh no. He retired a long time ago.
I thought so.
Personally, I think he would have stayed with San Francisco if he hadn't injured his elbow.
I think you're right.
The bottom line is that he had an awesome career.
I agree.
Now you know why I think he's the best football player of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you see that game last night?
Yeah, I can't believe how much the Bears came back
I know right? What a game
I thought they were done in the first quarter
Me too. How do you give up 3 interceptions in the first quarter?
I was pulling my hair out, I was throwing things at the tv
I know, I know. I was losing my mind too, But then they just turned it around.
Like two different teams, Like they learned how to play after the half
I don't know what they gave them in the locker room, but it worked.
Yeah, just as long as they don't get caught, I don't care what they give them if it makes them play like that
I think that was one of the best touchdowns I have ever seen
yeah, the guy rand the entire field, dodging guys left and right
Every time you thought he was ganna get tacked, he shook them off
The guy is like a greased pig
No one can touch him
I hope he stays on the team for a while
Yeah, they got to keep him
Superbowl, here we come.
thats what I'm sayin
Let's watch the next game here
XXXXXXXXXXX
The 2017 NFL season is about to start.
I have heard that and I am excited.
What team do you think will win the Superbowl this year?
I think that the Oakland Raiders have a good chance to win it all.
The Raiders are good but they play in a tough division.
I think with the addition of Marshawn Lynch that they will be unstoppable.
Don't you think Beastmode will struggle after being out all of last season?
I think his short retirement will leave him feeling healthy and ready to go.
The New England Patriots are always in contention in the AFC.
That is true, but Tom Brady is getting old and he can't dominate forever.
Who do you think is the best out of the NFC.
I think that the Atlanta Falcons with be the top team from the NFC.
The Seahawks are always in contention.
Seattle's offensive line is not good enough to be a contender this year.
Do you think that the Carolina Panthers can return to the competitive team they were two seasons ago.
Yes, Cam Newton will be healthy this year.
Who will win the MVP award?
I think it will be Derek Carr.
I think that Russel Wilson will win it.
He might be able to win it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like the Eagles are going to be the next big thing in the NFL
I feel the opposite
Whys that?
They dont have a young anything
Their quarterback?
Even hes older for a 2nd year player.
Well they can last longer if theyre smart.
I think thats part of it, but yeah they arent young anywhere
The thirst their receivers are going to have is going to be crazy
I admit the 1 year deal was a good thing no matter what you say
It could cost them but if hes hurt then they are geniuses.
I think they made good moves this offseason to improve the team
The defense will always be a question mark
Yeah I just dont know why that team has not fielded a good team in years
Every since Jim Johnson passed they havent
And their scheme is not all that complicated
I think its a bit vanilla.
Maybe so, but who knows
Cox needs a huge year
So does Jenkins or hes going to get cut
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Seattle Seahawks?
Yes I do, they're very good.
I think they're quarterback is Russell Wilson, right?
Yes, he's short but he makes great plays.
Who's their best defensive player?
I think it's Richard Sherman, he's an amazing player.
Does he make a lot of interceptions?
Yes he usually gets four or five a year.
Does Marshawn Lynch still play for them?
No I think he left the team and now plays for another team.
He was a really good player for them right?
He was great, he helped them win a Super Bowl.
How many Super Bowls has the team won?
They won one Super Bowl in 2014.
Who did they beat in that game?
The Denver Broncos, the Seahawks really dominated that game.
What's the name of the stadium that they play in?
I think it's CenturyLink Field.
Have you ever been to a game there?
No I haven't but my friend has, he loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Seahawks will make a run this year.
They always find ways to win games.
Yes they do.
Their offensive line could have used a little help in the offseason.
Yes,they are a little thin on the line.
Interesting to,see,if Eddie lacy will stay in shape.
I think his contract is loaded with reasons for him to slow down eating.
Haha,that was smart on Seattles part.
Russell Wilson could be entering his prime.
They need to keep Richard sherman motivated.
Yes they do.
Hard to believe they need to be motivated.
They get paid enough.
That's for sure.
They are tough to beat at home.
The hometown fans are something.
I think their defense will be good enough again.
I agree with you.
I'm not a Pete Carroll fan though.
No,but he motivates.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a read on the Vikings this year?
I really dont
I know me either
I looked at their needs, and their draft but I still am a a loss.
I think they will be solid
Probably yes...I just am confused
Well no more so than with Detriot
No kidding! I just dont get that team
I think both have great potential and good players
But its like their is a curse holding them both back
They have flashes though
As long as neither team is hurt I can actually see them beating eachother up
Hopefully the excuses will stop soon about their respective pasts/records
I think so. They just have to put it together
I know their fans are ready
Their fans? Heck the entire league
That is a great rivarly
I know it...and with the Packers
Easily one of the best group of three teams
For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am bored, do you want to do something?
Like what? I am actually kind of bored myself.
I have a few sports trivia games if you would like to play.
Are there any NFL questions involved?
I have not played in a while, but I think there are some.
The NFL is my favorite sport by far.
Mine to! I love watching the NFL more than anything else on television!
Cool, what a coincidence!
Me and my dad have always argued about who the best quarterback of all time is.
In my personal opinion that would be Peyton Manning.
No way! The best quarterback of all time is Dan Marino.
Well, who does your dad think it is?
He says Joe Montana, but he is a big San Francisco 49ers fan.
Then he might be a little bit biased in his opinion then!
That is what I always say to him as well.
I feel like Peyton Manning controlled games like no other quarterback in NFL history has ever done before.
He was great in terms of making adjustments at the line of scrimmage, but his performances in the playoffs hold him back in this argument.
That is true, however, I would take John Elway before Marino. He has two rings to prove my point.
I do not think rings should matter when talking about the best Quarterback of all time.
I feel like they separate the true great ones from the pretenders.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
It's not too bad to watch
Oh, not a huge fan?
No, not really but I'll watch it
Oh, who is your favorite team?
I like them all
No specific team then?
Well maybe the Dolphins
Why them?
Why not?
They suck!
Yea I dont care how good they are
What do you care about them
The colors
As in their jersey colors?
Yea!
...
I love the teal!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about them Bears?
Yeah, to Bears!
I love to watch how Bears play defensive.
Me too, I like watching the big game.
Gotta play good d to win the game.
Yep, that's what the game is all about.
Wish I had more time to watch them play.
Actually I like the old tecmo Superbowl on the nes!
You don't say? Me too.
I love playing as No Jackson on that game.
That game is so sweet.
Yeah it is, I love that game.
The Bears are awesome on that game.
Yeah, that's my favorite football video game.
That game has the best catching receivers of all time.
Well, yeah, that's what makes the game so great.
They need to make am online multiplayer version.
I would play that for sure.
Where do the Bears play at?
They play at downtown Chicago, that's where they play at home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you know about the NFL?
I know a little bit. The Steelers are my favorite team.
Oh nice, I don't really have a favorite team. Who does Aaron Rogers play for?
He plays for the Green Bay Packers.
Oh wasn't he in the news for something recently?
I think he broke up with his girlfriend.
Oh that's right! Who was he dating?
I think it was Olivia Munn.
I think that's right. How are the Steelers doing?
They did pretty well last season. They went 11-5.
Oh that is pretty good! Who are their best players?
Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown are both pretty good.
Yeah, I have heard of them. Who is their biggest rival?
People in Ohio are pretty serious about the Browns-Steelers rivalry.
Oh interesting. The Steelers are much, much better that the Browns though, right?
Correct. The Browns have not had a winning season in a very long time.
Who is that one player for the Browns who is always getting in trouble?
Oh, do you mean Johny Manziel?
Yes! That is who I am thinking of.
Yeah, he actually doesn't play for the Browns anymore, but there are rumors that he might play for Dallas this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you excited for this upcoming season?
YES!  I can't wait!
Who is your favorite team?
I love the Indianapolis Colts.
I used to like them, but they god rid of Payton Manning.
Yea, it was a sad time, but we got Andrew Luck.
He seems promising, but still to early to tell.
Well, he has been playing good.  However, time will tell.
How do you think the Colts will do this year?
I think they will end up 10-6.
What did they finish at last year?
I believe their record was 8 - 8.
Did they make the playoffs?
They did not make the playoffs.  They missed it 2 years in a row.
I hope they can turn themselves around.
Me to.  When they had Payton Manning, they never missed a play off.
Do they play a Monday night game at all?
They are currently scheduled for 2 Monday night games.
That will be fun to watch the 2.
It will be a blast!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, are you ready for the NFL season to start?
Of course! I can't wait!
What's your favorite team?
I'm a Saints fan, how about you?
Uh oh! I'm a Falcons fan, haha. Sorry about the beatdown we put on you guys last year.
Ha! Good one! We'll se if that happens again now that we have Adrian Peterson.
Yeah, AP is pretty good. At least he used to be before that ACL injury.
I thought he recovered quite well from that injury, actually.
Well, in any case, I wish him the best for you guys next year.
Thanks man! Hey, can I ask you a question?
Sure, what's up buddy.
How in the world did your Falcons blow a 25 point lead in the Super Bowl?
We don't like to talk about that anymore haha.
I can see why. I guess Tom Brady and the Patriots were just too great.
They really were! The Patriots have been so good for so long, we knew it would be hard keeping them down.
That's for sure. I really enjoyed that Super Bowl though, both teams played well.
True. I was really enjoying the game right until the 4th quarter.
Hahaha, maybe you'll get them next year.
Yeah hopefully, as long as we have NFL MVP Matt Ryan on our team, you can't count us out!
Yeah, but you're going to have to beat my Saints first!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready to watch your favorite team.
Yes. Go Giants.
I like the Colts.
I liek them too but I like the Giants better.
DId you hear they traded dwayne allen?
From the COlts?
Yes!!
He was good why?
I am not sure.
what team did they give hime too?
I am not sure if they traded.
What team did he end up on?
The patriots have him.
Wow. He will do good on that team.
I agree.
He is a good player.
He was one of the Colts best.
I am not sure why they traded.
I am not sure either because he was great with the team.
What a sad day in football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, are you pumped about Fournette coming in?
No why would I be?
Well he's going to make the Jags a lot better.
No he isn't, he's just a running back.
Yeah but he is the best running back in the draft hands down.
Dude, running backs are the most dime a dozen commodity in the NFL.
No way, I'd trade half my team away for Peterson in his prime.
Bro, look at the best running backs in the NFL, many of them weren't even drafted.
Ok what about some of the best? Like Peterson or Elliot?
That's my point, it's a crapshoot.  They're only as good as their lines.
Adrian Peterson would make any O-line look good.
I would disagree, there are very few rbs that could do that.
Like who?
I would say Barry Sanders back in the day was one.  His line was terrible, but that guy just couldn't be corralled.
So you're just saying draft linemen and not running backs.
Right, I think some of them can offer a lot, like McCaffery  He might end up being really important.
What makes McCaffery different?
He's just so versatile.  Kind of like a Curtis Martin, or LaDanian Tomlinson.
Yeah he can run routes with the best of them.
Right, which I think is the direction the NFL is headed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
it's a crying shame that carr broke his leg last season.
i know right.
i think the raiders could have gone to the super bowl.
me too.
how do you think they will do this season?
i don't think twelve and four but i do think they make the playoffs again.
what are they gonna do with beast mode?
you mean marshawn lynch?
yeah.
that's just another weapon. they should do what they do.
i definitely think they win the division again.
that division is weak. you got the chargers, denver, and the chiefs.
yeah, denver had their turn.
exactly. the chargers might be tough though.
chargers are always tough but last year they couldn't keep a fourth-quarter lead.
yeah so just imagine if they keep them leads this season.
no doubt. they will be tough but i still like my raiders.
i like them too. i need to take a look at their schedule.
yeah, last season that did have some gimmes.
hey, all you can do is play who's on the schedule.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the NFL's take on protecting the players now days?
What do you mean?
I mean all the rule changes with making the game less smash smouth.
Oh right, I'm not sure it's still football though.
Yes it is but a slower game than it was.
You have to admit things were getting out of control.
I can't argue with you.
People now days are so much faster and stronger on average than they were 20-30 years ago.
You think there are just too many good athletes now that it was becoming too dangerous?
It was always dangerous but when you have that many players on the field flying around it's over the top.
I see your point.
They might have taken it too far.
If the referees want to be jerks they could throw a flag every play.
That's true.
I just don't think that is a good thing.
Nobody wants to play hard only to be told that they need to tone it down.
Good point.
Who wants to be told by their boss to stop working so hard.
Just doesn't make sense.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tyreek Hill is such an exciting young player!
Did you see how many games he won for the Chiefs last season?
Oh I know he had so many good games. The most memorable ones were against the Broncos.
Didn't he score 3 touchdowns in that game?
Yes he did. He had a kick return for a touchdown, a rushing touchdown, and a receiving touchdown.
He's so electric when he's returning kicks and out in the open field.
It's his speed and quickness. The guy is lightening fast, strong and just knows how to get open!
I can't wait to see what he's going to do this season with the Chiefs.
I think the Chiefs are going to win 12 games and take the AFC West.
I think they'll finish with 11 or 12 wins but the Raiders will win that division.
Tyreek Hill needs more touches on the offense.
He's so explosive it would be a crime for Andy Reid their coach, to not put in more plays for him.
I think we'll see Tyreek featured in a lot of plays since they let Jamaal Charles go.
That's right! I forgot the Bronco's picked up Jamaal Charles.
That's a big pickup if Charles can stay healthy. He's too injury prone.
Demaryius Thomas and Jamaal Charles on the same team, that sounds exciting on paper.
If he Jamaal stays healthy it'll great for the Broncos.
Yes I agree. Their defense is top notch they just need their current offense to catch up.
It's going to come down to Trevor Siemian. If he steps up and improves the Denver Broncos will be dangerous next season.
I think he will improve. He looked good last season for his rookie year and I think he'll only get better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're a panther's fan right?
Yeah, unfortunately, but they've always been my team.
I bet you were happy for super bowl 50 haha.
Yeah, I don't want to talk about that.
How are they looking this year?
Same as last year.
Cam getting any better?
Yeah, he's still got his attitude, but him and Funchess seem to be really clicking this year.
Who else do you guys have?
Well, Jonathan Stewart is arguably a top 5 RB this year.
Yeah he is, I'm trying to get him in fantasy.
And you can't forget about Kelvin Benjamin.
Actually, I did haha, how did I forget him?
Who knows, but I think he'll finish top 10 this year.
He did pretty good last year.
Yeah, wish he would've been good all year.
Can't have everything brother.
I know, but we'll still beat your team haha.
That's not saying much...I'm a browns fan.
I know, and once again they'll be terrible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What teams do you think will be in the Superbowl this upcoming season?
Hard to tell. There are a lot of good teams and injuries can change things.
Agreed, but if you had to take a guess.
Well I would go with the safe choice, the New England Patriots.
The Patriots? Really? Tom Brady is about to turn 50 isn't he?
No, he will turn 40 this upcoming season and he still looks as good as ever.
I know you are probably right about the Patriots being in the Superbowl but I just don't like them.
The last Superbowl against the Falcons was an amazing game. They are fun to watch.
No doubt that game was amazing. It has to be one of the most historic NFL games ever.
For the Patriots to come back from a 25 point deficit was one of the greatest things I have ever seen in football.
Yeah the Patriots are good but what other teams do you think could be in the Superbowl next year?
The Atlanta Falcons.
The Falcons? You don't think they were kind of a fluke last season?
Not at all. The team from last year is still in place and they have a good schedule next year.
Lets hope if they do make it to the Superbowl again they don't embarrass themselves.
If they make it back again I don't see any team coming back from a 20 point deficit to beat them.
What other teams do you think have a chance to make it to the Superbowl?
The Cowboys, Chiefs, Raiders, Texans, maybe even the Steelers.
The Texans? You can't be serious?
They have a great defense. If they can get a decent quarterback they could go all the way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Superbowl III.
The first AFL superbowl victory.
Yes, with Willie Joe Namath.
The only Superbowl the Jets won.
Joe Namath predicted a victory.
Yes, where was he?
The Miami Touchdown Club.
How did the scoring go?
The Jets scored a touchdown in the second quarter.
What was the score at halftime?
7-0, Jets.
Who was in the halftime show?
The Florida A&M University Band.
Not like the extravaganzas of today.
Not at all.
Who announced it?
Curt Gowdy.
What happened in the rest of the game?
The Jets scored three more field goals, and the Colts had one touchdown.
And the AFL finally established parity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's it going? We're having a Superbowl party in a couple of weeks ypu wanna come?
How are you watching the Superbowl in August?
Every year before preseason we throw on a classic playoff game or Superbowl and make a party out of it.
Sounds like a blast. What game are you showing this time?
1990 Superbowl ,Giants and Bills.
I remember that game, it came down to the last play, right?
Yup. Giants won by a point after that missed field goal.
Scott Norwood, the poor guy.
That was Parcell's last game with the Blue.
What a way to go. Do you have a favorite Superbowl of all time?
Although I was a kid when it happened, I'd have to say Broadway Joe in '68.
That game is legendary. As far as classic games go I like '79 Steelers and Cowboys.
You must be a Steelers fan, they all love that game.
That's right. what's not to love? - Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris.
Bradshaw put up some serious numbers in that game.
Dude he threw for 318 yards and four touchdowns.
Roger Staubach was no slouch in that game.
A dropped pass made the difference.
Most years I think the final playoff games are more exciting than the Superbowl.
Everybody is trying to make it to the Show. They have more at stake on playoff Sunday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe NFL training camps are about to start?
No! I'm so excited.  Football is my favorite sport to watch.
Living in Cleveland, football season is actually pretty brutal for me; the Browns are terrible.
It should be interesting to see how Myles Garrett, Jabrill Peppers and David Njoku impact the team.
I agree, but I am still very skeptical.
Who do you think are the teams to watch this year?
It's hard to imagine anyone being able to hold off the Patriots.
I agree - but Tom Brady can't have that many more great seasons in him.  He's 39!
I think the Giants could be a strong playoff contender.
Possibly, they do have a great defense.
Do you go to a lot of games?
Not really, the tickets are so expensive.
I also feel like they are so long - I prefer to watch on TV so I can get up and walk around a little bit.
Who is your favorite player to watch?
I love watching Cam Newton.
Yeah he's exciting.
Did you watch the draft?
I actually went to it.  It was insane.
Wow! That must of been great.
Seeing some big names get drafted will definitely stick in my memory for a long time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the rule changes the NFL has made?
I like some of them, but not all of them.
Which ones don't you like?
I don't like how you can't hit a quarterback anymore.
Yeah but they are trying to protect them.
I get that, but it's football.  They are gonna get hit.
Well the NFL is scared about getting sued for concussions.
That's a lawsuit they won't win.
Why don't you think the NFL will win?
There has been evidence for years the football causes concussions.
I still think the players know the risk.
They do know the risk, but it's because the NFL tried to cover up concussion that will get them in trouble.
Would you let your kid play football?
No, there are too many other safer sports.
Oh come on.  Football makes men out of boys.
I agree it's a tough sport but I'd rather my kid play basketball or baseball than football.
How many NFL players get concussions?
Almost all of them at one point in their career.
I guess that is a good point.
NFL football isn't ballet.  It's a dangerous sport.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like the NFL right?
I watch it every year.
Whose your favorite player?
My favorite player has been retired awhile.
Who is it?
Ray Lewis.
He was such a good Middle Linebacker.
The all time best.
That's questionable but he was very good.
He was feared and carried that team in skill and spirit.
He was a beacon of light for the Ravens defense.
Who do you like?
Someone who is also retired.
Who would that be?
Brian Urlacher.
Didn't he play Middle Linebacker for the bears the same time era Ray Lewis played?
That's correct.
That's a man who was the reason the bears defense was any good at all.
He truly carried that team at that point.
He was a good player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the upcoming season?
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see Pittbsurgh steelers in action.
They are a good team. I heard their owner passed away.
Yes. He died April 3rd of this year.
What was his name again?
Dan Rooney.
Pittsburgh Steelers  had a good run with him; they had a NFL record of 6 Super Bowl Championships.
Yes. Don't forget they won 15 division championships, 8 AFC Championships in his rein; also.
Boy you seem to know your stuff.
I am a loyal fan of Pittsburgh, as you can see. What team do you want to see win this year?
I would like to see Tampa Bucs take it this year.
It seems that after winning the superbowl in 2003, they have not made plays until 2007.
Don't underestimate the team though; they have a lot of new players.
Yes I see they signed a new quarterback.
Who you talking about? Sean Renfree or Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Oh, yes. Back up for Jameis Winston.
I heard he is pretty good, but I guess we will soon see for ourselves.
I hear that. good luck to you and your team.
Same to you. Thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about them St. Louis Rams?
Oh yeah? How about them Philadelphia Eagles?
You a Philly fan?
Yeah how about them Philly Eagles?
Nah, I'm a Pats fan.
All they cheat with deflated balls!
Oh, no, not that again!
Well they did cheat with, you all's quarterback got caught cheating deflating balls, so they'd be easier to catch.
No excuses, my Pats won
Yeah, only because they cheat!
I can't wait until the pats get another championship.
i would like to see them go against the Bears in the Superbowl.
Bears just not the same team they used to be.
I like them Buccaneers.
I like the 49ers.
I thought you were a Pats fan.
Well I also got a second house in the San Francisco area, so I'm a 49ers fan too.
Well then good for you.
You bet, I get all these teams to choose from because i have homes in many different cities.
i hope the bears make it this year to the Superbowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite sport is football. What is yours?
Mine too.  What do you think about drug use in football?
I wish it were nonexistant.
It can ruin a sport.
That's for sure.
I hope that teams tackle drug abuse as much as they work on tackling players.
That's true.
It would be great if teams educated players from a young age.
It would be incredible if the players and coaches would be on the same page about defeating drug abuse.
It's a shame that players would get involved in that.
They are so harmful to the body and take away from the game.
I hope the professionals keep promoting to stay clean.
Me too.
Football is such a great sport and you need a great mind to play.
Many don't realize just how much acumen is required to play along with strength.
I think some of the best players are geniuses.
That's true.
Many top players not only are strong, but highly academic.
What a great sport.  I hope it continues for a long time.
No doubt it will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What city is the best NFL city?
Wow, that's a good question.
I personally think it's Dallas.
Naw, Dallas has to many bandwagon fans.
I'm not talking about the Cowboys but the city they play in.
Well technically the Dallas Cowboys play in Arlington, Texas not Dallas.
Ok, what do you think is the best NFL city?
I think it's Chicago.
Why Chicago?
They have great fans and love the team.
So do the Cowboys fans.
Chicago fans still support the team even when they suck.
I guess Dallas fans don't have to do that since the Cowboys are usually good.
Here, how about Buffalo.
That town isn't a good NFL city.
Those fans support that team no matter what.
I guess that's true.
What's the worst NFL city?
That's easy it's Los Angeles.
I agree Los Angeles has terrible fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to football starting up again?
You know, I've lost interest lately. I just feel like the NFL is corrupt.
Really? There aren't any rivalries you like to follow, or certain games you want to watch?
I mean, I'll follow the Raiders' season halfheartedly.
I can't believe they're leaving Oakland!
Yeah, it's really disappointing. I don't think I can pretend to be a 49ers fan.
I don't blame you. I'm not an Oakland fan, but I'm sad to see them leaving, since I enjoyed going to a game or two every season.
So what's your favorite team?
I'm from Cleveland, so I'm a Browns fan.
Ouch. At least your baseball and basketball teams are doing well!
Yeah, but it would still be nice to have a decent football team.
On the bright side, it will be hard to do any worse than last year!
No kidding. I was prepared to go the whole season without a single win!
That would've been rough. The Raiders were looking so good last year...until Carr got injured!
Ah, yeah. I felt bad for the team and the fans, even though I'm not a Raiders fan. That was hard to watch.
So how are the Browns looking going into this season?
Hard to say. I've learned, as a Cleveland fan, to take it one day at a time! I really hope we can give Joe Thomas a good season for once, though!
He's a great offensive tackle.
He's one of the best!
Well, good luck to you and your Browns!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading the other day about Terrell Brown who plays for the St. Louis Rams. They said he weighed in at 403 pounds.
I know right. There are some really huge players in the NFL.
Yeah, I know some guys are that big naturally, but you just know that of lot of them have to be on steroids.
Right, doesn't the NFL have any rules about the use of steroids?
They do, and they've had them for a long time. But, you just have to believe that most of them are using steroids, and the league is just looking the other way.
I know, there just isn't any way someone can get that big without a little help.
Wow! Can you imagine getting hit head on by one of those guys. I'm 220 pounds, but it would still be like getting run over by a tank.
Yeah, it's no wonder there are so many concussions in the NFL. That's another thing they have been really good at covering up.
It's just starting to come out now. Some of the older retired players are starting to suffer the system and are starting to talk about it.
A lot of players and teams and the teams doctors knew they were playing with concussions and nobody cared.
You know, being a pro football player is a hard way to go.
Yep. There's the pressure to be bigger, stronger and faster than the next guy. And if you don't go along with the program, you don't play and you don't make the big bucks.
I wonder if I were in that position if I would decide in faver of my career, or in faver of my health.
It would be a tough choice. But, it's no wonder so many of the NFL players have violent episodes when their not playing.
Yeah. Between the steroids, and the concussions, and who know what other kinds of pain killers and stimulants they're probably taking, it's a wonder any of them are sane.
Do you think the NFL will ever actually start enforcing some of the rules on that type of thing?
Nope. Not as long as the fans pay to see the games. Nothing will change.
Your right, it's the fans that keep it going.
Hey, by the way I've got tickets for Sundays game. You wanna go?
Are you kidding, I wouldn't miss it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go to a Vikings game this season.
Did you win the lottery?
No, but I really want to go.
You practically have to take out a third or fourth mortgage to afford a ticket to a pro game these days.
Tell me about it. And even then they're hard to find.
Way back in the day my Aunt had season tickets.
Wow, you have to be on a waiting list to get those now.
I know, and they are a billion times more expensive now that they were then.
Did she go to a lot of games?
She did until her health started failing.
That's when she sold them?
No, she hung on to them for years and years past the point that she could attend games.
Why?
Because of the waiting list, She didn't want to let them go.
Did you ever go to one?
Once, and never again.
Why?
Aside from the fact that I dislike sports this was an outside winter game back when the Met Stadium was where the Mall of America stands now.
You didn't like it?
I felt like a prize fool sitting outside freezing and paying for the privilege.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What can we expect from the 2017 NFL season?
Expect more stability and less drama. Politics should play less a part, and the focus will be more on football.
What about rules changes?
The NFL seems to be clueless about what the rules are supposed to accomplish, and after some encouraging recent ideas the league keeps trying to fix what isn't broken.
Is overtime an area of interest?
Overtime should be eliminated in the regular season. It is a device designed to break a tie, and there is no need to break a tie in the regular season.
Are the new stadiums a benefit to the NFL?
Maybe. This is the third clearly-definable stadium boom in league history, but the new buildings detract from the game instead of enhancing it.
What are some mid-level contenders that might become wild-card playoff teams?
The Buffalo Bills are one. Stability and focus on football should help the upstate New York team make progress. Tyrod Taylor is underrated.
What other mid-level teams show promise?
The Bengals keep coming back for more, and the Saints might string some wins together if Drew Brees stays fit and able.
Any others? Like Minnesota?
The Vikings are a gritty outfit that needs a few breaks, but their mindset is good thanks to Mike Zimmer.
What goliaths are shadows of their former selves?
The Packers are an odd duck, a passing game with hardly anything else. They hardly evoke the Mike Holmgren & Brett Favre successes, let alone the glory years of Lombardi and Starr.
Maybe the Giants fit in this category also?
Definitely. After Manning, who is there on the roster who is truly reliable? The talent is there in spots, but can it be counted on?
How about the Steelers?
A good team with a good coach and good quarterback, but — much like the Packers — there isn't much else to get excited about, aside from James Harrison.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When are you going to get your tickets to the Bills game?
We are going tomorrow.  Should we get the tailgating pass too?
Yes, the midfield tickets with tailgating is the best deal.
Have you been following Coach McDermott this offseason?
Yeah, I'm really pumped but I think he has his hands full.
Do you think he is going to stick with Tyrod Taylor all year?
I think he has to given the contract he just signed.
What if they start out like 0-4
If they have that kind of start, he's going to need to considering benching him.
What are options do you they have?
Well, they always have Yates
Oh god.  Do you think we have any chance getting Garrapolo from the Pats?
I doubt they would ever trade him within the division
I think we would have to give up lot for them to even consider it
Weren't they asking for four first rounders?
Yes - and we ca't afford to mortgage our future on one guy.
But a quarterback is the most important position
I agree, I want to see another year of Tyrod - especially with a new head coach
Lets give the new guy an opportunity to show us what he has
I'm hopeful that we are playoff bound in 2 years tops
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite football team?
In the NFL?
Yes.
I am a fan of the Denver Broncos.
They are a good team.
I really liked watching when Manning was playing there.
He was fun to watch.
He was fun to watch with the Colts as well.
I bet it was nice having him play for your favorite team.
It was.
Is Siemian the quarterback now?
He is.  I don't know how good he will be.
It is hard to compare with Peyton.
It is.  They have other good talent.
They are a good team all around.
I hope they can go all the way this year.
They have the team to do it.
As long as they can avoid injury.
That is true, it can ruin any good team.
Yes it can.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess who is making a comeback.
Brett Favre?
No, even better. Todd Marinovich.
Really, with what team?
The SoCal Coyotes
Are they a NFL expansion team?
No, they are in the World Developmental Football League.
I've never header of it.
Not many people have.
When's the last time he played in the NFL?
1993 for the Raiders.
Any how old is he now?
A spry 48.
So, he'll never make it back to the NFL.
Unlikely, he might not even start for the Coyotes.
Do they have a good QA?
Yes, Jacob Russell was at the helm for their unbeaten season last year.
Is he 48 too?
No, he's only 25.
Half the age of Todd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the superbowl this year?
I'm not sure, the patriots are always good so they're a good bet.
But the cowboys have a strong team with Dak and Elliot
That is a good point, but I do like my Packers! They have a great receiving core and a solid offensive line.
Aaron Rodgers is a beast, have you seen his TD to INT ratio? It's off the charts!
Sure, but he needs to stay healthy, remember when he was injured by the bears? Even last year he was injured a bit.
He can be legendary if he could only win more superbowls
Yeah but Favre only won 1 and he's still legendary
I suppose, but look at Brady, he's probably going to be remembered as the best QB of all time
I can't believe he's still playing at such a high level, if only Rodgers had such great teams
I think this year it's fiinally the packers year don't you?
Possibly, but there are so many more options
If you had the first pick in our fantasy draft who would you take
Rodgers no doubt
See then clearly the Packers are one of the frontrunners!
But Brady is a close second
Then again you can't discount injuries
Honestly, whichever team weathers the injury storm the best will likely be in the best position
Totally agree, you look at the past superbowl winning teams and they all were miraculously healthy
Well, only time will tell which team will avoid the injury bug, here's to a safe and competitive NFL season!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, looking forward to the NFL season starting?
Yeah, last year was really good. I'm hoping for more good games this year.
It's tough though, I'm a 49ers fan and it's painful to watch them lately.
Ouch, yeah. They'll pull it together eventually, they always come back around.
Meanwhile I've been enjoying the Patriots a lot. I jumped right on that bandwagon.
Right at the Super Bowl? Man, you couldn't have picked a less likely time.
Nah, I've actually been following them for a couple of seasons, since the 49ers have been sucking.
They've been putting on some great football.
I couldn't believe they pulled out that win at the super bowl though.
Yeah, history making plays right there.
What an upset.
Not as upsetting as the halftime show maybe.
Haha, yeah, but some of it was alright.
I had kind of given up on the game by that point. If it isn't close, I just lose interest.
I was still interested, but it was hurting. After all I've been through with the 49ers the past few years, I didn't want to get crushed so hard again.
It had to be rough for the Falcons and their fans though man, I tell you.
Yeah, it would have been cool to see them win a super bowl there. But I was Patriots all the way.
I didn't have a dog in the fight, so I just wanted a good game. The first half didn't deliver, but that second half had me on the edge of my seat.
Yeah, we probably won't get anything like that this year.
But there could be some really good games regardless. Here's to your 49ers finding their way back to the path of champions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much longer is this gonna take?
What is?
The tickets for the Pats vs Giants game!
Could be an hour, maybe two!
Okay, I'm tired of waiting!
Why, man? WE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS MOMENT
WELL, I AIN'T WASTING MY MONEY IF I DON'T GET ANY GOOD, DARN SERVICE HERE!
Dude, stop overreacting!
AGHHHHH!!! I want to get in the stadium already!
Dude, you're going to cause a fuss!
Who cares? I want to get in!
You're acting like a little 5 year old boy, who's excited to see the Giants!
Nahhh, man!
Then why are you complaining?
Cause I wanna see Brady, man!
Why him?
Because he's so cool!
Fine, man! But will you quit complaining?
YESS! I will!
Good, now be quiet, before someone calls the cops on us!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch last year's Super Bowl?
Was that the Patriots comeback?
Yes
No, I did not
Why not?
I am not a football fan
Yes, but it was amazing even to a non football fan
Well, not me
Do you watch any NFL?
No
Did you ever?
I used to like the Dolphins
What made you stop?
They never won
You are not a loyal fan
I used to be, but I got tired of it
Well, how about I take you to a game next year?
Sounds good
That will make you like it again
I hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Tony Jefferson joining the Ravens?
Well last season resulted in a Pro Bowl selection so I'm sure they think he's a good fit.
Well from a defensive standpoint I think the team suits him well.
I personally think it's too soon to tell but I hope he's happy with the move.
You didn't see him on Total Access the other day?
I caught a bit of the interview but I missed the majority of it.
Oh you should of see it. I thought it was a good interview.
What did he say?
Well he talked about how well the team defense fits his personal style of play.
One thing I've noticed from his play is he like to cover.
Yeah, he was literally Arizona's swiss-army knife on defense. He did everything well.
Well I'm sure he's going to do well, i can't really see him failing unless the tam holds him back somehow.
What kind of things do you think the team would do to hold him back.
Anything that would force him to play out of his comfort zone is enough in my opinion.
I don't see the Ravens doing that to him.
I don't either, It would be a dumb move overall on their part.
Absolutely agree with you there.
Do you think he will carry his team to the super bowl?
It's really hard to tell but I wont say it's impossible.
I wouldn't say it's impossible either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the nfl season to start.
Yeah me too, so exciting.
Who's your favorite team?
The packers!
Oh nice, they did really good last year.
Yeah they did. Hope no injuries like last year though.
Yeah, I saw that.
I was so mad that both our corners were injured during the playoffs.
Matt Ryan really lit up your secondary.
Don't even remind me, I was so bummed.
Well this is a new season.
Yeah, I hope those new draft picks on defense pan out.
Same here, I'm a niners fan.
Oh really?
Yeah have been for a long time.
Niners had a good draft.
Yeah they did, so excited about John Lynch's moves.
I saw that, you guys fleeced the bears.
I couldn't believe it too.
Who gives up so much to trade up one spot?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think Tom Brady will do this season?
He is good every year so probaly good.
It seems like the guy never ages.
yea, he is basically immortal.
I think he will slow down eventually and retire.
They really should start giving his back up a bigger role.
He gave them great minutes when Tom was out.
yes, it is a shame he has to sit the bench and wait.
Im also excited about marshawn
ohh yea he is making a comeback .
Wonder how good the team will be.
I think they will do alright this season.
Yea I just wonder if he's still got it.
I dont know .
Only time will tell.
Father time always wins in the NFL.
Yes it does.
Who are you rooting for?
Browns.
No response.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk Pittsburgh Steelers.  How about their 2008 draft picks?
Ouch.  That was a tough one.
Yep.  Not one of their picks is still with the team.
You're right!  Bruce Davis!  He was a linebacker, right?
Yep. He went to the Oakland Raiders.
Only for a couple of years, though, right?
Yep.  He didn't pan out there at all either.
At least he ended up close to home.  Wasn't he from UCLA?
Yes.  Guess you he ended where he started.
What about Rashard Mendenhall?
Oh man.. he fumbled and people still blame him for the Green Bay Packers loss.
Well, ya gotta blame someone.
Yep.  Let's blame him.  He doesn't play for the Steelers now.
Huey Richardson is the one I remember as being a horrible pick.
Oh absolutely.   What about Tim Worley?
There's no way he was gonna be the next Herschel Walker.
No one can be Herschel Walker.
It's crazy someone actually thought that.
Well, we can sit here all day blasting Pittsburgh.
You know it.  Let's lighten the mood with Terry Bradshaw talk.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will be the favorite to win the Super Bowl this year?
I will have to say New England since they are the defending champions
There are a lot of solid teams in the NFL this year
Yes. The Patriots have Tom Brady
Brady is getting old though
You seen what he did last year at 39. He is only going to get better
I think that the Raiders are going to be solid this year
David Carr should certainly have them in contention
You certainly cannot count out Atlanta
That is true. They are the defending NFC Champions
They could have easily beat the Patriots last year in the Super Bowl
I still cannot believe that the Patriots came back in that game
The Falcons just imploded. They done nothing in the second half of that game
You can never underestimate Tom Brady and Bill Bellichick
I am a Redskins fan so I hope they can do something this season
Their offense took a hit in the offseason though
We did end up doing good in free agency and in the draft
Who were some of the players you picked up?
Terrelle Pryor and DJ Swearinger to name two.
Nice. Then you did not do too bad then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Super Bowls did the Steelers win back in the 1970s.
Four.
Wow, when did they win their second one?
1976, for the 1975 season.
What number super bowl was that?
Super Bowl X
Oh so number ten?
Yes, that's what X is in roman numerals.
Who did they play in that one?
The Cowboys
Oh wow, I bet that was a big one.
Yeah, Cowboys are a fan favorite team.
Well, not for everyone
But they do call themselves America's team.
I think the Pats are America's team.
No way, only if you live in New England
Same goes for Dallas. Only if you live in Texas
Not really. Houston can't stand them.
Yeah, that's a good point.
I wonder what San Antonio thinks of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So i noticed some odd things with Tampa's schedule.
How so?
Well, for starters They play The Falcons twice as well and the Panthers and the Saints.
Yeah, that is a bit strange.
Serious. Especially since the Falcons and the Saints are in our division.
Well, it sounds like the Bucs better have it together in those games just for ranking.
Agreed, by why such limited diversity?
I don't know.
Well, in the beginning, the Bears should be no problem.
True.
Now the Patriots are gonna give us a bloddy nose.
Wouldnt it be great if we got lucky and beat them hard.
Yes, it would. After that it's gonna be Arizona and Buffalo. Shouldnt be that hard to win.
Arizona maybe, Bills, no problem.
Then it's Panthers, Saints...... where the divisional rivalry begins.
Yes, the Bucs will have to be cautious those next 5 or 6 games.
Those are the games that are gonna define playoff position.
Agreed.
The last three games are the same way, Falcons, Panthers and Saints.
Ugh, lot of stress in those last three games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Aren't you a Packers fan?
Sure am!  Aren't you?
Of course not.  I despise them.
And why's that?
Because everyone I know seemingly is a Packers fan.
Sounds like my kind of people.
I'm just sick of people wearing green and yellow to work all the time.
We're an invested group of fans.
And don't get me started on those stupid cheeseheads.
You are not dissing the cheeseheads.
Oh, but I am dissing them.
It's the most original concept in the league!
You call wearing fake cheese on your head original?
Absolutely!  It's certainly recognizable.
If you never want to get a date ever again, you wear one.
You'd be surprised how many cute girls sport those things.
They are obviously crazy.  Probably just want to marry Aaron Rodgers.
Can't blame them, he is a successful guy.
I'm pretty sure he's married already.
If not, I might introduce my sister to him.  I could use some more money and season tickets in my life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey I just saw the NFL draft a few weeks ago. You ready for the season?
Yeah, I am going with my team as always - Washington!
They lost too many players like Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson. They won't be able to replace them.
Maybe - but we have some good young players coming up like Josh Doctson.
True - and that Kirk Cousins is the man at QB.
Yeah he is good. Hope they can keep him under contract and get him signed long term.
that would be good for y'all.
Who you rooting for? I know you like Dallas but...
Nah I am still a Cowboys fan always. Dak Prescott and Zeke Elliott are the Boys these days.
yeah the rookies turned that mess around in Dallas. I'm glad Tony Romo is gone.
I think we got an upgrade with Dak - hope he avoids the sophomore slump
Yeah thats what you have to hope - that he can produce like he did this year.
Well I hope I can get to the Dallas / Washington game this year. Tickets are going quick.
We should go - you know its going to be a battle.
Yeah it will be - I am down for going if the tickets aren't super crazy expensive.
You know they will be - but I will keep my ear to the ground and if I hear of some cheap ones I'll get them so we can go.
Bet. I would like that a lot. And I will pay you back.
I am looking forward to the games this season - there is always a new team on top. Like where did the Oakland Raiders come from last year?
I know - I hope its just my team.
Well my team is already there!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any thoughts on the Detroit Lions?
I think they have a nice team.
Yeah I was rooting for them this season.
It was a shame they went down to the Seahawks in the first round.
I know I was hoping they would advance to the second round.
Well it's all the more reason to make that their goal this season.
There is no reason for them to think they aren't capable of that.
Seeing the Detroit Lions get to the Superbowl would be fun to watch.
If they won the Superbowl I would celebrate for a week!
Yeah I love to see underdogs do the unexpected.
I doubt any analysts are talking about the Lions winning the Superbowl next season.
They should look at all possibilities!
With a little luck and a healthy roster anything is possible.
Let's hope for a miracle run by the Detroit Lions.
I'll be hoping that happens all summer.
At the least I want to see them have a good year.
Yeah improvement would be great.
I would love to see them win more then ten games in the regular season.
That would give them confidence in the playoffs.
Exactly what I was thinking!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw you have quite an NFL collection in your house.
Yes, I have a lot of jerseys from the different teams.
How did you get them all?
Some are from sporting goods stores and others are from auctions.
Do you have autographed jerseys?
Yes, I won an autographed Franco Harris jersey.
Wow, that's incredible.
I also collect football cards.
How old is your most antique one?
I have some from the 1960's.
Really, I heard the Cowboys just joined the league then.
Yep, in 1960.
That's pretty cool.
I love my old NFL cards.
They are sweet.
What other collectibles do you enjoy?
Well, I like my Eagles coats the best.
The leather ones are really nice.
I love them too.
What will you get next?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team in the NFL is your favorite?
I live in New York City, so I should like the Giants or the Jets, but instead I like the Patriots.
Really?! Why don't you like the Giants?
I don't know... I just don't. I'm not a fan of Eli Manning or any other players on that team.
Well, I think Manning's just OK but they do have some superstars, actually.
Like who, for instance?
Odell Beckham, Jr., one of the greatest wide receivers in the league.
Yeah, all right. I guess you have a point there. Who else?
Weston Richburg and Jason Pierre-Paul.
OK, you've made your point. But whenever the Patriots play the Giants, you know who I'll be rooting for.
Is it tough to be a Patriots fan in New York?
Not really, no. You'd be surprised how many there are.
But the Jets are the Patriots' big rivals... not the Giants.
True, but the Patriots have faced the Giants in the Super Bowl.
Yeah, it's gotten ugly.
I mean, the Patriots are better than both of those teams, you have to admit.
I admit that the Patriots are better than the Jets.
That's pretty obvious.
The Jets have been terrible for a long time.
They actually had winning seasons in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2015, but they've been struggling overall for years and years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am pumped for some NFL!
Me too! Next month can't come soon enough.
They are broadcasting 8 of the pre-season games.
Pre-season games mean nothing.
It is a chance to see the new rookies play.
True but the stars don't play.
They don't want to risk an injury before the season starts.
It makes evaluating teams really difficult.
Are you still  Steeler's fan?
Big Ben all the way! I have my towel ready.
The one thing about Steelers fans is you can find them all over the country.
A lot of cities have Steeler fan bars.
Who do you think will make the Super Bowl this year?
I think the Giants have a good chance.
It is hard to stop Odell Beckham Jr.
Eli Manning still has a few good years left
Do you think he will retire and do pizza commercials with his brother?
The Mannings know how to make money.
I think the Patriots will make it to the Super Bowl again.
They seem unstoppable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't know about you but, I can't wait for the NFL season to kick off.
Me either. I actually bought the NFL package so I can watch any game I want each week.
I see Tom Brady is either now or will soon be 40. Wonder what kind of a year he is going to have.
I think he has a way of winning regardless of who he is working with on offense.
The second half of the last Superbowl was flat crazy.
I am not a Patriot fan but, I was totally impressed with them coming back from a 28-3 deficeit.
I think the Falcons showed they had not been in a Superbowl and the Patriots showed they had.
Falcons just got way too convervative in the second half and that cost them dearly.
Who do you think will be in this years Superbowl?
That is a tough question. Wild guess..Green Bay & Pittsburg.
Who would you want to see win with that matchup?
The Green & Gold Packers. My favorite team.
Why are the Packers your favorite team?
I was born in Wisconsin and started following them as a 5 year old.
Who is your all-time favorite?
Has to be Bart Starr. I loved watching him.
What do you think made the Packers of the 60's such an outstanding team?
Vince Lombardi. Broke my heart when he left Green Bay.
What is your opinion of Aaron Rodgers?
I think he is the best quarterback in football hands down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey NFL Training Camp starts in a few weeks!
I'm pretty excited. Do you think the Packers can win the Super Bowl this year?
With Aaron Rodgers it's always possible.
I think he'll love throwing the Martellus Bennett.
That dude is awesome. Do you follow his Twitter?
It was funny when he had fans vote on his jersey number.
The defense doesn't look too good though...
I am hoping for a bounce back year from some of the young corners.
Do you think Dom Capers should be fired?
He is starting to get old.
I can't believe all the people who want Mccarthy fired.
He has one of the highest winning percentages in the NFL.
Or what about Ted Thompson retiring?
I would love if they pick up the old Chiefs GM.
Are you going to any games?
Maybe a preseason game.
We are going to Family Fun Night.
Awesome!
Go Pack!
Go Pack!
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you see the Super Bowl last year
most definitely
that was a completely stunning game
I thought it was totally over by half time
yes, watching the Falcons give up that lead was an incredible reversal
I can't stand the patriots, but that was a comeback for the ages!
definitely. say what you want about Tom Brady, but he really does know how to win
I'm definitely not the biggest Brady fan, but I agree that was truly impressive
i would also say that Bill Belichick deserves a lot of credit as well. he kept them in that game
he didn't just keep them in that game, he motivated them to not quit, and gave them a playbook for the turnaround
If I was an Atlanta fan I would have been sick
I was a little sick watching their lead evaporate, and i'm not even a fan
The Falcons had such a high power offense that season, its a shame they couldn't take it all
yes they were putting up huge stats on offense. it wasn't uncommon for multiple RBs to have hundred yard games with multiple touchdowns
yep, but there defense wasn't exactly the best
well compared to the patriots, their defense wasn't as good at all. the Pats defense put in a very solid year
in the end, it helped them pull out the big game as they completely stopped the Falcons after the 3rd quarter
some people are saying that the last super bowl performance cemented Brady as the greatest of all time after that comeback
I think there is a really good case to be made for that
I can't wait til next season starts
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where are the boys?
The are outside playing football.
That's about right. It's halftime of the Texan-Patriot game.
Yeah. They raced outside screaming, "I want to be the Texans...you can be the Patriots!"
That's the tradition. Every halftime, my Dad used to take my brother and I outside to throw the ball around.
Why don't you go out and play with them?
Not now.
Why not?
Because of the other tradition.
What was that?
That was when we would come back inside after playing football.  Fall in upstate New York was cold and wet.
No.
You guessed it!  We would come back in the house all muddy and grass-stained, dripping wet, with mud on our shoes, pants, shirts...you name it!
That was the tradition?
No, the tradition was driving our Mom crazy!  Just like we ran outside screaming to play, upon our return inside she would run around screaming, and chase us off of the furniture and into the showers.
That must have been crazy!
I missed the third quarter of more games that way than I can remember!
Go ahead. Play with the boys.
Are you sure?
Yeah, go ahead. And I promise I won't scream when you come back inside the house all muddy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
nfl about a month away.
what?
preseason about to start.
preseason?
yeah.
man, talk to me when the regular season start.
you don't like the preseason?
they don't start playing until like week three and four.
but the guys trying out make them first two games fun to watch.
i can't get involved.
that's on you partner.
you only involved because you probably be betting on them.
nope. it's illegal to bet on football.
whatever
well i can't wait til the preseason my dude.
maybe i'll come over and watch a few games with you.
shoot. i just watched the super bowl again last night.
on what?
the nfl network.
oh. i thought you were goinna say that you tivo'd it.

Ok, we are going to do something different. I'm going to name quarterbacks and you give me your thoughts on them.
Ok - sounds cool!
Tom Bradt
The greatest QB of all-time, champion, sure fire Hall of Famer
Drew Brees
Accurate, tough competitor, Hall of Famer
Aaron Rodgers
Talented QB, selfish, great arm
Andrew Luck
I think Luck is talented, but injury prone.  He'll be a guy that will never reach his full potential.
Cam Newton
Very selfish player, he's a running back trying to play QB.
Matt Ryan
Solid QB, but he will never reach the Super Bowl again.
Ben Roethlisberger
Tough as nails, good passer and hard for defenders to bring down.
Philip Rivers
Underrated player, one of the best QB's in the league.
Derek Carr
Up and coming superstar. Will get to the Super Bowl and win it before he retires.  This is fun, can we do more????
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Seahawks chances?
I dunno, seems like they can't get over the hump.
Maybe, I think they have a strong year though.
How many games do you think they win?
I'm guessing 12.
I think they win 10.
Russell Wilson makes them competitive.
Yea, with him in the game, they always have a chance.
They sure spanked the Lions in the playoffs last year.
That was a beating.
I hope their defense is improved.
It had better be.
I miss the Hawks being in the AFC.
Yea, it still seems funny with them in the NFC.
I miss the rivalries with San Diego, Denver, etc.
Those were great times.
Steve Largent was an awesome receiver.
Is he in the Hall of Fame?
If not he should be.
I couldn't agree more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Seahawks confuse me in general. Last year you guys beat the Patriots in an amazing game, but then you also had that 6-6 game against the Cardinals and then a 9-3 game against the Rams
Any team with a good DLine or some sort of elite pass rusher can give Seattle a ton of difficulties.
Seems like against those teams Wilson is under pressure for a good majority of all drop backs and it just throws off the offense completely.
That's because they haven't had any quality OL.
The Rams had decided to go with the super athletic, high ceiling players.
well, tom cable also does not care about pass protection.
Rams are 4-2 in the last 6 meetings. I don't know how to explain it.
Jeff Fisher's superbowl was the good team(s) in the NFC West.
I wonder how Browns fans immediately reacted after that fake fumble in the Skins game.
Dude we were all so mad. Cost us the game, that and the pseudo unsportsmanlike conduct call on Pryor. Infuriating.
We're the only team besides the Packers that Rodgers hasn't beat yet
Just need to play them in the Superbowl and its a guaranteed win.
The Colts man. We're like 3-18 in our last 21 matchups.
how did you manage to win 3 games? asking for a friend
There it is Titans. If you want to break the streak just get you a Von Miller. Easy peasy.
If we're like 14-0 going in, sure.
Philip Rivers always beats us. Doesn't matter how. Doesn't matter when. He could literally beat us with half his starters on IR.
Yeah I was going to mention this. He seems to carve up those Seattle cover 3 defenses
Pats are the Bills kryptonite.
Bills fans know how to talk a big game, but secretly in week 4 last year we were all terrified that the Bills would find a way to lose to Julian Edelman at QB.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you think there ever be another Superbowl Team like the 1985 Chicago Bears?
No. Sometimes greatness and sweetness In the NFL is a once in a lifetime thing.
Sweetness? You talking about Walter Payton. He died didn't he?
Yes he did.
Is he the only of the 1985 Superbowl team that has died.
No, Dave Duerson has passed.
You now that I think about it, they have and are experiencing some rough times.
Yeah. They're saying McMahon might have the same thing Duerson had.
Aw no. I also heard Big William Perry was sick.
Yeah I heard that too but I don't think that was the concussion disease.
Then what is or was it?
I think I heard he has diabetic issues.
That's sad. I heard he lost a lot of his money too.
I don't if it's true but I heard that also.
How did Payton or Sweetness  as everyone calls him die?
I think he had a bad liver or something like that?
You think they will ever call Ditka back to coach any football team?
I don't think he wants to coach anymore.
I wonder where Richard Dent, Mike Singletary and Otis Wilson are these days.
During Superbowl season they can be found commentating on different sports shows.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you been to any NFL games?
I've been to a couple, mostly for the Green Bay Packers
Who did they play?
The Chicago Bears
Who won?
The packers of course! The bears are terrible
Yeah that makes sense. Was it enjoyable?
Yeah it was fun, a little cold though
I think the Packers play better in cold weather
They definitely do
They play most of the time in cold weather
They are fun to watch as long as its not too cold
Sometimes I hear that if you buy a beer at some games it will freeze solid before you can finish it
Yeah that happened to me one time
What do you do about it?
You drink the beer really fast
I bet that makes the game more fun to watch
Yeah if you wear like 20 layers
I love going to NFL games
Me too, they are a great atmosphere!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Mike Ditka used to play and coach the Chicago Bears?
Really, no I didn't.
I just found that out.
Do you remember the skits they used to do on Saturday Night Live?
They were pretty funny.
Da Bears. Ditka could do no wrong.
Chicago Bears were a part of a lot of shows.
Really. I didn't know that.
Yes, big fans on T.V. shows like Married with Children.
Jay Cutler is a great player on that team.
He is.
In the fourties they beat the Redskins 73-0.
Wow, what a killer game.
Wish I could've seen that one.
I wonder how that team will be this year.
Don't know. It's a lot of chance on teams parts if you ask me.
You're right. Anything can happen in a game..
Seems good players get hurt a lot too.
Well, let's keep an eye on the Bears.
I know I will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some good old hard-hitting football?
I've waited long enough.
What are you expecting to see this coming season?
I really want to see whether some of these young quarterbacks bounce back or progress.
Which ones specifically?
I'd like to see Winston and Newton can take over the league
I think Winston definitely has the higher probably of progressing this season.
You don't think Cam can bounce back?
I really feel like he's overrated in a way and people definitely hypes him far too much?
How so?
If you look at his previous season outside of his Superbowl season he really hasn't had that great of a career.
Yeah, that is true. People definitely did treat him like he was the best quarterback in the league.
I also think Jameis is a much better leader. He is a lot more relaxed.
I can't disagree. Cam definitely looks a lot more frail when you look at his press conferences.
I think Cam has great potential, but he needs to drop the antics and play ball.
Ever since that Superbowl loss it looks like he never really got it back together.
That and to be honest their team that year had a lot of luck in my opinion. You don't see a lot of Superbowl teams with that bad of an offensive line.
Both teams that season had terrible o-lines, but I guess it speaks volume to how important  good running and a great defense is.
Yeah, I agree, but notice both teams fell apart this season for that very same reason. Their porous o-lines caused poor quarterback play.
Definitely! Ultimately, I think the Bucs and Jameis will progress significantly, because they have an awesome o-line and even more weapons on offense. I look forward to seeing the results.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who won Super Bowl V?
That would be the Baltimore Colts
Oh, not the Indianapolis Colts.
No, they were originally in Baltimore
But now they're the Ravens.
Well, no the Ravens were originally the Cleveland Browns.
But isn't there a Cleveland Browns team now?
Yes, it's complicated.
Okay, but the Colts won Super Bowl V
Yes, it was Johnny Unitas' first Super Bowl.
What year was it?
1971
Oh wow, it's been awhile then.
Yes, it has.
Where did they play it?
Back then it was in the Orange Bowl in Miami
Oh, I don't think that exists anymore.
Yeah, I'm sure they've built a new one since then.
Who did they beat?
The Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, it is July already.  You about ready for some football again?
I am, but I do appreciate baseball.  Where I live at all I hear about is football all year long.
Yeah, you do live in New Orleans...............they love their Saints there.
That they do, but I'm a Dallas Cowboy fan. Cowboys forever.
The Cowboys had a great year last year.  Bet you never saw that coming.
I didn't and hardly anyone else did either.  I would've never though that Romo would not be a Cowboy.
That was a shock.  Dak is where it is at, though.
He is definitely the future.  Hope he stays healthy long term.
Yeah, and hopefully he doesn't go into a sophmore slump because sometimes the rival teams have figured you out in your second season.
I hope not.  I hope he is the Cowboy's quarterback for a long time to come.  We are actually picked to face the Patriots in the Superbowl.
I did read that.  If that is the case, I'm pulling for your Cowboys then.
I hear you.  You get tired of hearing about the Patriots and Brady all the time.
I mean he is a great quarterback, but I like it when new teams win the Superbowl.  I mean, that is when my team isn't in it.
Your team?  It must suck being a Browns fan.
Yeah, I don't go into my closet at night for fear of hanging myself.....hahahaha.........I don't expect much from the Browns that is for sure.
At least they won a game or two last year.  They were barely projected to do that.
Yeah, don't remind me.  I don't know how the Browns will ever turn it around.
Look at the Cowboys, been losing for years recently and now we are preemptive favorites all of a sudden.
Well, we'll see what happens this year that is for sure.
Yes we will.  Good luck to you even though being a Browns fan it's usually bad luck.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Rick! How's work going?
Its going well Bob! Lots of projects on the go.. you know how it is!
Yeah! Are you going with the family anywhere this summer?
Yeah Im going up to Canton, Ohio
Why up to Canton? You have family there?
No no, Im taking the family to see the NFL hall of fame!
wow really?! I didnt know you were an NFL fan
Oh yeah but mostly my son is!
Wow how old is little Tim again?
He turns 8 next month!
wow thats amazing.. I remember when you started here he was three!
yeah he's really growing up!
who is his favorite QB of all time?
He likes Dan Marino
Oh thats because we live in Miami!
Haha, he actually holds a camp every year to train future football players
Really? Will you send Tim?
I sent him last year
Wow that must have been be exciting for him also
Yep! It was!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Dwaye Allen's chances this season?
I don't know, he should be fine.
Yes, but he never really worked out in Baltimore.
True, but in New England he has Tom Brady throwing to him.
Yes, but Andrew Luck is also pretty good.
Yes, but only one of those guys is already guaranteed a spot in the Hall of Fame.
I will give you that, but what about Gronkowski?
What do you mean?
Well, if Gronk is healthy, won't he take all the catches.
He will get his share, but there is always room for more.
Even so, will there be resentment over salary?
Because the two have similar contracts, you mean?
Yes, that is what I'm asking.
Well, they are all professionals.
OK, what about the coaching.
Well no one knows what Bill is thinking.
I was referring to the Offensive Coordinator.
Oh, Josh McDaniels.     He will be fine.
So you see this as another Patriots victory.
Yes, that is my interpretation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I'm a big Eagles fan, myself!
Ah, are you from Philadelphia?
Yup! What team is your favorite?
I'm a Colts fan.
That's Indianapolis, right?
Yes! I'm from Indiana.
How do you feel about the Patriots?
I'm not a fan of that team. I assume you aren't either?
Nope. I don't like them or the Giants.
I like the Giants a bit because Eli Manning is on that team.
Why does that matter?
I'm a fan of his brother Peyton.
He is not on the Colts, though, is he?
No, but he used to be.
So you like the Mannings?
Yes, I like anyone from that family!
That's interesting!
What other team do you like?
I also like the Seahawks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ugh, I'm so tired of the Patriots winning everything.
Tom Brady forever, baby.
Ok, but he's getting old. This can't possibly continue.
He eats like nothing but nuts and seeds. He's going to live forever.
I don't think he's going to die. I think he's just getting too old for football.
Age is nothing but a number!
Besides, there are other contenders.
Yeah, like who?
Uh, the Packers?
Come on...
The Seahawks?
Are you serious right now?
Ok, maybe the Pats will win again. But this can't go on forever.
Who says?
I bet if the Pats win 3 Super Bowls in a row someone will kneecap Brady.
I'm surprised nobody has yet.
It's because everyone's scared of Belichick.
Wow, maybe Belichick will retire.
No way. He's gonna coach from his deathbed.
He's not a quitter, that's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Drew Brees?
Well, he's good, but he's getting older.
Yeah, he's not as good as he used to be.
Right.  I cringed watching most of the games last season.
Even the year before last was kind of tough.
I know, right?  I really wish they had given the backup quarterback a chance that year.
Who were the back up quarterbacks over the last couple years?
The ones I remember were Luke McCown and Chase Daniel.
Oh, yeah, I remember them both.  Wasn't McCown in that commercial?
Yeah, the one for the telephone company.
Yeah, that was it.  I had to laugh at that one.
Well, why not make the money however you can?
I guess not.  Even if you have to laugh at yourself.
How do you think the team as a whole will do this year?
Hopefully better than last year.
Yeah, I know what you are saying.  Every year it's disappointing.
I watch a few games with high hopes, only to be let down.
Hopefully things go better this year.
Well, we will see.
Do you know when the season starts?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest NFL player of all time.
That's a tough question.
For me it is Joe Montana.
Well, he's a top 5 QB for sure but not the best player overall.
Okay so who would you pick.
I would choose Mike Singletary .
That's an intersting selection, why?
Because he was the key to the best NFL defense of all time and arguably the best NFL team of all time.
Hard to argue with that.
Yeah, Buddy Ryan's system was built around his unique abilities.
That was an amazing defense and Payton and McMahon  gave them enough offense.
I think the team that most resembles them would have been the Baltimore Ravens.
The linebacker position is realy key to a great defense.
I agree, but great middle linebackers are rare.
How about best QBs? who is on your top 5 list?
I'll go with Montana, Unitas, Marino, Brady, and Manning.
I can't argue with Brady after last season, but Manning?
I think Manning is a lot like Marino, his best years were on poor teams.
Okay, and your top ever?
Has to be Joe Montana.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, I just truly think that Tom Brady is tough to beat.
Yea, he always is, but eventually age catches up.
Yea, I agree, but did he show any signs of getting old?
No, not really he was still really good.
Exactly! Last year was as goof of a year for him as any.
It was! I just always think eventually his arm will tire.
Yea, I agree, but they just know how to win.
Yea, that is true. One hit on them and they could be in trouble though.
Yea, they have to keep him healthy.
Yea, if not the Patriots, maybe the falcons can win this year.
Yea, it was a shame that they couldn't hang on last year.
Yea, they had it in their hands and just blew it.
Yea, that or the Patriots just took over.
Yea, a little of both.
Its tough to beat teams that have won before when it gets to crunch time.
Yea, there is something to be said about knowing how to win.
Yea, I agree. Belichek and Brady both seem to.
Yea, they just have what it takes.
Yea, I do not know if any team in the AFC can overtake that  tandem.
Maybe Pittsburgh, but I'm not sure if they can either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch nfl football?
Yes
I enjoy watching the colts
They are a good team
Yes they are
Im ready for the games to start up
Me too
Preseason starts august 13
When does regular season start?
September 10
Oh alright
Yes, their first regular season game is against the bills
Sounds good
Im real excited
Same here
I hate the off season
Me too
Its so boring
It is
Nice talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the most evenly matched division in the NFL today?
I would have to say the NFC East. Did you know that no team has finished first in the NFC East in consecutive years since the Eagles in 2004.
That's really interesting. I just think that the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants are far superior to the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins.
While I think that the Eagles are probably the worst NFC East team going into the season, they have a great young quarterback and could be competitive. Everyone forgets that they started last season with a 4-0 record.
True, but both the Redskins and the Eagles lack organizational strengths of the Giants and Cowboys.
Are you seriously contending that the Jerry Jones-owned and operated Cowboys exhibit organizational strength?
Jerry Jones gets a bad reputation because of his crazy actions as GM during the late 1990s and 2000s. However, his focus on drafting a strong offensive line demonstrates how he has begun to mature as a GM.
The Dallas Cowboys is an organization that allows Dez Bryant to be late to or miss numerous meetings per year. How is that a strong organization?
I acknowledge that Dez being late to meetings was a major issue in the past, but they're working to solve it. However, it is undeniable that in recent years, they have drafted the best offensive line, the best running back, and the best young quarterback in football.
True, but much of Dak Prescott's success was due to the fact that teams didn't know how to prepare for him last season. I doubt that he'll be as good this season.
I think he's going to stay the top quarterback in the NFC East this season.
That's ridiculous! There is no way he is better than Eli Manning.
Eli Manning has led the league in interceptions on numerous occasions. Although he's a two-time Super Bowl MVP, both were very fluky.
It's hard to consider his Super Bowl wins flukes when he did it against Tom Brady, arguably the greatest quarterback ever, both times.
I have no problem referring to his wins as flukes. He won his first Super Bowl off a crazy helmet catch from David Tyree and won the second Super Bowl because Wes Welker dropped a pass.
Regardless, Eli Manning has provided stability to the Giants since he was drafted and has an unmatched ability to remain calm under pressure.
I just think that the Giant's recent success has more to do with Odell Beckham Jr. and their defense than it has to do with Manning.
Odell Beckham Jr. is another overly emotional wide receiver that is a distraction to his team.
That argument is so old at this point that it's not even worth going into. He filled the void that Victor Cruz left following his series of injuries.
I just think that it will be hard for the Giants to reach another Super Bowl if Odell Beckham Jr. does not take things more seriously.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Beth.
Hi Scott.
You ready for some football?
You know it!  How much longer?
I think it's like two months.
Yeah, you are right.  Early September.
Training camp stuff will start at the end of the month.
That's right.  I saw something about that on Facebook.  You going?
I was thinking of heading over to the Razor for one day to check stuff out.
Taking the kids?
You know it.  It's half the reason to enjoy it.  I like showing them around and teaching them the game.
Gonna eat at Toby Keith's grill?
Why not?  Patriot Place is a cool area with shops and stuff.
Yeah, I got this hat and tank top there, last year.
We went over at Christmas time and got a bunch of stuff for under the tree.  It was really pretty.
Oh I bet it was.  Mr Kraft does a really nice job with his businesses.
I think they are putting in a new hotel to have more people be able to stay on game nights.
That will be  a big plus.  I love to tailgate and hang out after the game.
Especially when we win!
HAHA.  You are totally right about that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey I like that Seattle Seahawks Jersey
Are you a fan of theirs
Yes definitely, they have one of the best teams of the league
I certainly agree. They are my favorite
So.Did you get your jersey signed or is it a reprint
No. Its authentic C.J. Prosise signed this last year.
Wow. That might be worth alot in a few years
It's worth more to me now. I will never sell it.
A few years ago I had a pair of sweats signed by a pro quarterback, that cost twenty dollars, after they were signed they were worth a thousand dollars
Really? What pro quarterback ?
Crockett Gillmore
Wow. I hear he's the secret weapon for the Baltimore Ravens this year
That may be true. He's definitely got skill
I didn't know his paraphernalia was worth that much
May be worth even more. Who knows
Well as for my jersey I don't plan to sell it
Alright I believe you.
But I may change my mind if you offer two grand.
Okay, I'll give you two grand for that New York Jets jersey with the signature !
Nope. Its not for sale
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's almost time for football to start training camps again.
Yeah, I know.  I have been looking forward to this season.
Me too, last year was good, but I expect even better results this year.
Now that the Cowboy's new quarterback, Dak Prescott, has a year of experience, he should be even better.
You would think so, but do you think he can top last year's performance?
It will be tough, that's for sure.
That's what I was thinking.
It depends on how that offensive line will do this year.
They keep getting better and better every year.
Right, so maybe this year will be the year the whole team actually makes it past the 1st playoff game.
I hope so.
It's just frustrating to have a good season, then not be able to win a playoff game.
Maybe it has to do with the coach.
Teams do prepare differently when it is a playoff game.
And maybe Jason Garrett just doesn't know how to prepare the team when it comes to the playoffs.
That's very possible.
They have only won one playoff game since he has been the head coach.
I know, believe me, I know!
Well, lets just hope this is the year to take it all the way!
I am so excited, I can't wait for them to start playing games!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy NFL football?
Yes I do.  Have always watched.
Do you have an all time favorite team?
Yes.  I have always been a fan of the Dallas Cowboys.
Are you happy or bummed that Tony Romo retired?
I guess you can say happy.  We now have Dax and he is awesome.
So do you think Prescott will have a good year?  Or one year wonder?
He has a lot of potential.  He is great under pressure.  Do you like him?
Yes I think he is good.  And with Elliott there,  there is no stopping them.
Yes they make a good duo.
So you think Dallas cowboys in Super Bowl?
More thanlikely.  Not sure against who.  What do you think?
Maybe a repeat New England Patriots.  They are always contenders.
Maybe.
What do you think of the Tennessee Titan?
They made some good moves in the off season.
Yes. They picked up Eric Decker,  if he stays healthy he can do some damage.
Yes,  if he stays healthy.  And they also have Murray who was a few good years left.
Yes I think so.  Who is their quarterback?
Not sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch the NFL?
I do but not as much as I used to.
Do you have a favorite team?
I enjoy watching the browns.
Why the browns?
I like watching them because it was my dads favorite team so I became a fan at a young age.
That makes sense.
I also like how they play smash mouth football.
They do play that old school style.
I really like it.
That's what football is all about.
I can't agree more.
I enjoy the Indianapolis Colts.
Why?
Same reason as you my dad was a big fan of them.
Any other teams.
I also like Green Bay and the Favre era.
He was so passionate.
He made football at that time nobody played like him.
I can't agree more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you r day of fall?
Fall why should I be?
It's football season baby.
Ohh, yea football.
So who are you going for this year?
You know me die hard Cowboys fan.
Boo, Greenbay over here.
Yea that right boo, for Greenbay.
You know Aaron Roger is starting to,get pretty old.
Well old or not still better that Romo.
Hey how many rings does Rogers have
Yea yea, stats wise Romo was one othe the best
Yea yea this year will be different
Yea it will be we have Elloitt and an awesome quarter back
Well see, i still think that greenbay will go all the way
Nope Cowboy Nation baby
Hey do you want to try to make it to a game this yeaR
Yeah, I never been but I'm down for it
Awesome will look for some tickets
Sweet let me know
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are ready for some NFL?
Yea,I think we should go to a few Giants games this year.
Yea, that sounds like a lot of fun!
Do you think we will finally get back to the playoffs this year?
I sure hope so, it has been quite the drought.
Tell me about it! Those Superbowl's seem like ages ago at this point.
They sure do! At least we have a great quarterback and receiver.
That is true, but we need way more than that to reach the promise land.
I think we need to work on that defense a little bit. It must improve!
I agree, at least we took a defensive player in the first round this year.
That is true! He is a cornerback, right?
Yea we selected Eli Apple from Ohio State.
Do you think he will be able to come in and play right away?
I am not sure, that is the expectation though.
Some guys seem to be ready right away and others take a little longer.
That is true. Hopefully Apple can come in and be a lock down corner for us.
How do you feel about the coaching staff at this point?
I am not very impressed by Ben McAdoo to be honest with you.
He needs to get us to the playoffs this year in my opinion!
At the very least I would like to see some serious improvement from our team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the AFC West for next season?
I'd have to say that they are currently the best division in the NFL.
Really? They only have two good quarterbacks, and Phillip Rivers is in the twilight of his career.
That might be true right now, but both Kansas City and Denver have competent quarterbacks that could return them to the playoffs.
I don't think that either Trevor Siemian or Paxton Lynch are ready to take Denver back to the Super Bowl. Regarding Kansas City, do you think rookie Patrick Mahomes will be great this season?
Mahomes has raw talent and can likely develop behind Alex Smith.
Yeah, but Alex Smith is not great. He totally botched that playoff game last year against the Steelers.
No one would call Smith elite, but he's a decent enough game manager that could shepherd them to the playoffs. Once they get into the playoffs, you never know what will happen.
I just think that Kansas City lacks what it takes to close the deal and win a Super Bowl at this point.
The thing about Kansas City though is that there success largely stems from their dominant defense. This is also the case with Denver.
No one is disputing their defenses. Denver won Super Bowl 50 mostly based on their defense.
I'm sure you're aware of the old saying that offense sells tickets and defense wins championships.
Yeah, but I'm not sure if that still applies given all the rules changes from the past decade that tend to favor the offense.
Great defenses sill matter. That's why I wouldn't count Denver or Kansas City out this season.
I am by no means counting them out and believe that either one or both of the teams have a decent shot to make the wild card round.
Also, you haven't yet addressed the Oakland Raiders, which is probably the strongest team within the AFC West going into next season.
I think that they're an excellent team. My fear though is that they were able to be good so far because they had a relatively young team still on rookie contracts, which will change in the next couple years.
They've already locked in Derek Carr to a long term deal and Khalil Mack is the most dominant defensive player not just in the AFC West, but in the NFL.
I disagree on both points. Von Miller is the most dominant defensive player in both the AFC West and the NFL.
Von Miller is good, but he's helped too much by other players in Denver's defense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's almost football time, man.
Yes, sir. Pats are gonna take it all the way for Brady's sixth ring, I think.
I think that too. I wonder who can even beat them?
Maybe the Packers, but Rodgers has to start playing for real in the playoffs.
Yeah, until this year, he was one-and-done since 2011.
I didn't know that, but it doesn't surprise me. They always fall in the playoffs early.
I think he needs a better defense. His offense is obviously pretty decent.
Pretty decent!? I think you mean aboslutely monster!
No Lacy this year though.
True. But they got Bennett.
He may add another dimension to their blocking game.
They probably need him with getting their new back up to speed.
It's still an offense that revolves around Rodgers though.
Oh, yeah, for sure. His arm is probably the best in the NFL.
Remember those Hail Marys!?
Yeah. I felt so bad for the Lions!
I felt so bad for the Packers when they had a successful Hail Mary against the Cardinals, but then lost still.
That was a downer. But that pitch to Fitzgerald was amazing.
Yeah, it was. Well, I'll see you on the first kick off next month.
Sounds good. Football is almost back!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Doesn't the NFL pre-season start soon?
Kind of, right now its still training camp and the pre-season games won't start until September.
Gotcha. How are your Packers looking this year?
So far I like what I see at training camp, but we are still a long way from football season.
I don't know how I feel about the changes to the Redskins office, I feel like it can go either way at this point.
Yeah, I heard there were some big changes on the offensive line and the coaching staff.
Do you think any big name players might be playing their last season this year?
Maybe, Brees is getting old and so is Brady.
But Brady has been having some great seasons! He is ready for retirement.
True, but personally I'd rather quit while I'm ahead than stay in the game and go out with a loosing season.
Does this mean you think your Packers stand a chance against the Patriots this year?
Of course! But, I'm not so sure the Patriots will be up for a repeat performance of last year.
Are you going to get tickets to any games this year?
Maybe, they are really expensive and I'd have to travel a few hours.
Which ones are you looking at?
The Packers have a pre-season game in DC against the Redskins, and there is a game just before Christmas against the Panthers in North Carolina
The pre-season game would not be as exciting as the game against the Panthers. They had a great season last year, it should be a good game.
Yeah, but the pre-season game has cheaper tickets. That and the game against the Panthers is on my birthday and that would suck if the Packers lost.
Well, let me know if you go to the pre-season game in DC. I'd love to check out the new recruits for the Redskins.
Sure thing! I'll look at tickets tonight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the NFL season?
I sure am.  It's going to be a great year for football?
Why do you say that?
I am a Patriots fan, and they're always good.
Hmmm...last time we were together you were a Bronco's fan.  What's up with that?
Oh, well, since Peyton Manning retired, they haven't been very good, so I switched to the Patriots.
Wow.  What happens when Tom Brady retires?
If the Patriots don't do good, I will find some other team to follow.
Wow.
What?  Who is your favorite team?
The Dallas Cowboys.
Hmmm...They just got good a few years ago too.
Yeah, but I was a fan of them when they were terrible.
Yeah, sure.
It's true.  There are pictures of me as a kid wearing Dallas Cowboys shirts and stuff.
Really?  I guess that's impressive.
Well, they are my team, and even though I like for them to win, I will cheer for them when they lose too.
Good for you.  Maybe I should just stick to one team.
I think that would be a good idea.  Who will you pick?
I don't know, lets see who wins the Super Bowl this year, then I will decide.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, which division is driven by the best quarterbacks?
In my opinion there's no debate in the No. 1 spot. NFC South's QB quartet is in a league of its own right now.
I agree! I'm a Ryan and Newton fan myself but what about Prescott and Manning? NFC East has a nice lineup as well.
Manning can't hold a candle to Brees though, he has more 5,000-yard seasons than every other quarterback in NFL history combined.
Eli Manning is Eli Manning. The two-time Super Bowl MVP is tough and clutch and still great.
But Brees, He's Canton bound ... yet still terrorizing defenses in his late 30s.
Ok what about AFC East?
That's easy Tom Brady of course!
For Sure! Man the Jets have the worst quarterback situation in the NFL right now!
Yea but on the flip side, Brady is the G.O.A.T.
You also have Taylor in that mix, I've always liked Taylor!
Yea and the Bills will function like an actual football team with a new head coach im thinking!
I'm excited to watch Taylor this year.
AFC Wes

Who is best player in the NFL?
That is hard, there are a lot of good players.
How would you narrow it down?
I would say, who is the best quarterback in the NFL?
Ok. Who is the best quarterback in the NFL?
Tom Brady.
Why do you think that?
Because he has won five Super Bowls as quarterback of the New England Patriots and he is a fierce competitor.
Five Super Bowl wins?
Yeah.  And not only that, he was voted MVP in four of them.
Wow. That is incredible.
Yeah, especially when you consider he won his first Super Bowl in 2002 and the last one in 2017.
What? That is fifteen years apart!
That's right.  Tom Brady will be forty years old this year.
And he's still playing football in the NFL? That's truly remarkable.
It really is. And with few signs of slowing down. I mean many think the last quarter of football he played this year was his best ever.
Really? What happened?
Unbelievable fourth quarter comeback to beat Atlanta in the Super Bowl.
Sounds like he might not only be the best player now but also the greatest of all time.
Not everyone wants to admit it, but yeah, I would have to say that its probably true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you be surprised if the Philadelphia Eagles won the Superbowl next year?
I think everyone would be surprised if that happened.
It's not completely impossible for them to win it.
John Kennedy was about to get inaugurated the last time they won a Superbowl!
Wow that is longer then I thought.
They need a rebuild if they are looking to win a Superbowl.
Would you keep any of the current players on the roster in a rebuild?
It is to early to tell if Carson Wentz is a player to rebuild around.
Yeah he had 16 touchdowns but 14 interceptions last season.
1 to 1 is not a great ratio.
You are right though he could get better this season.
The front office must be praying that he does.
Would you bet any money on the Eagles winning the Superbowl right now?
Only if the odds were ridiculous to the point that betting ten dollars would make me rich.
I am sure the odds are pretty great already.
Hey maybe it would be worth it then.
Yeah I mean you either lose ten bucks or gain hundreds maybe thousands.
I will think about it.
We better watch the start of the Eagles season closely.
I am with you on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello chap. Excited about some American Football.
Oh heavens yes.
How many concussions do you think they'll obtain.
Many possibly.
Many, Allah willing.
Indeed this game has me excited to the core.
I'm counting down the hours to the first kick of the football
Agreed. This American football game will be the most exiting of all.
I wish the best for both teams
Allah willing the Oilers will dominate the Astros in this AmericN FootbLl game
Indeed, Chap. indeed.
I will pray hard for all players to play well and with good sportsmanship.
As will I old boy, as will I.
Will you eat peanuts and fracker jack?
I don't care if I ever come back!
Jill good show old boy.
Well said fellow American Football fan.
It's America's pastime, after all
So they say, so they say.
A rousing 'hurrah' for all the chaps plying American Football!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Patriots will win the superbowl again this year?
I am not sure.
The Atlanta Falcons will want to win.
I can't believe they lost a 25 point lead.
Tom Brady is just a great quarterback.
Will Atlanta want revenge against New England?
They will want to win regardless of who they play.
We will have to see what happens.
Good point we don't know who will play in the Superbowl next year.
For all we know it could be two different teams.
How many more years do you think Tom Brady will play?
If it were up to him he would play forever.
Do you like him?
I think he is a good guy.
He is a nice guy and talented.
I just don't know if they will win it again next year.
We have to wait a long time to find out.
Well at least we can enjoy the summer air for now.
I agree the weather is to nice to stay inside watching sports.
Yeah let's go play football outside!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best Super Bowl you ever saw?
This years!  Without a doubt.
I agree.  The Pats comeback was pure gold.
No kidding.  I've never seen anything like that.
Yeah, first and only Superbowl to go into overtime.
Yeah, and that drive to get to the goal line was great.
I think we can all now admit that Brady is the greatest of all time.
Yeah, he's top three or four in numbers, and king of the rings.
Yeah, so glad I'm a Pats fan.
We are blessed here in New England.
Although not when it comes to weather.
But surely when it comes to football.
Yes, best coach, and best quarterback in history.
Yeah, and how good Jimmy G is as a backup is awesome.
Yeah, the winning will just continue.
Can't wait for next year, Pats have gotten even better.
Which has to be scary for the rest of the NFL.
I know, how mad is Goodell right now?
He has to be fuming.
I can't wait for the repeat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Mark Sanches?
Oh wwo, i havent thought of him in YEARS.
Yeah, everyone thought he was the next Joe Namath.
Yes, there was a rumor the coach had a tattoo of him on his arm, that's how sure he was gonna make the Jets a dynasty.
Yes but you know what he's always gonna be known for, right?
The "Butt Fumble"
Oh man, that was so funny.
I remember. This guy was suppose to be the next hero and then got lost in obscurity.
Butt Fumble. Man, it's been so long since i heard that.
I know, right?
Any idea what he is doing now?
No clue.
I think The Fridge took over for infamy around that time.
Yes, i think if the "Butt Fumble" and Perry had not got famous, Sanchez would have been one of the greats.
You think?
No doubt. He was taking off back then.
That's too bad.
My thoughts exactally.
Who replaced him on the Jets?
I don't know, i'll have to look it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been keeping up with the NFL draft?
I have. I'm really excited for next season.
I have been thinking a lot about defenses coming into this season.
There have been a lot of good defensive picks drafted in.
Who do you think has the strongest defense for the coming season?
I personally think the Denver Broncos have a phenomenal lineup.
You're not wrong there. They are definitely top three.
Who do you think has them beat?
In terms of defense I would say the Seattle Seahawks.
That's true. The Seahawks defense is looking insane again.
Yeah, it's been nothing new for them to dominate defensively.
I have to say the Texans are looking really strong defensively, too.
True, their defense might even be ahead of the Broncos.
I would say so too.
Wasn't there some talk of the Richard Sherman being up for trade in the offseason?
Yeah. I forgot about that.
He plays a huge role in defense for the Seahawks.
Yeah, I don't think they would do half as well without him.
Still, I don't see the team moving him after the draft.
That's true. I think it's safe to say he'll be staying a Seahawk in the upcoming season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Panthers will do this year?
It's harder to tell after a losing season than a winning season.
What do you mean?
They have never had back-to-back winning seasons, so it's safe to assume they will have a losing season after a winning season.
What about after a losing season?
More times than not, it's a losing season, but they they have had winning seasons after a losing season.
What was their problem last year?
It seemed like 99% of the time, a defender was in Cam Newton's face before he got to the end of his drop back.
Do you think they did enough to fix the offensive line?
Probably not.  It also didn't help that the receivers dropped passes all the time.
What do you think of Christian McCaffrey?
Hopefully he pans out they way everyone expects him too, but I feel he is being over-hyped.
Has Netwon started throwing since his surgery?
Yeah.  I hate how the media made a big deal about when he got his surgery.
I know what you mean.  Andrew Luck got surgery and still isn't thowing, but the media doesn't seem to care.
I'm not sure, but the Panthers may be the only team in NFL history to never have back-to-back winning seasons, but make the playoffs for three straight years.
Really?
A few years ago they went 12-4 and made the playoffs. The year after that they made the playoffs with a losing record because the NFC South was so bad.
I remember that.
The year after that, they went 15-1 and made the Super Bowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how many wins will the Jets have?
They might not get any.
True. They are clearly tanking for next year's draft.
If you're going to start Christian Hackenberg at quarterback, that's the only possible message.
Yep. And there's no one to throw to, with Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall gone now.
No kidding. Who could they beat?
The Browns. Maybe. Perhaps the Bills on a really good day. Otherwise, I can't see a winnable game.
Yeah, they're probably going to be picked to lose every game.
That seems like it'd be fine for them, what with teh "Suck for Sam" campaign
There lies the silver lining: At least 2017 will end and they'll get a shot at a good QB for 2018.
But would San Darnold be the answer, if they land him?
I dunno. USC quarterbacks like Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez have not translated well to NFL success, but Darnold is pretty good.
That's IF he comes out. He may end up staying into the 2018 college season.
But that's the advantage for the 2018 draft. Ther's Josh Rosen, Josh Allen, Mason Rudolph - a lot of QB options.
This is the Jets, though. They'll screw it up.
Maybe. They have been without a franchise quarterback since ... well, Joe Namath, really.
Goodness, has it been that long? I can't take any more of watching these guys.
One more terrible season, then it should begin to swing upward, my friend.
I sure hope so. I'm already dreading Sundays this year.
Could be worse. We could be Browns fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, only a few more weeks until the NFL is on again.
Yeah, I know, I can't wait.
What's your favorite team again?
The Atlanta Falcons.
That's right.  They had a great year last year, but it's too bad they couldn't hold on to the lead in the Super Bowl last year.
I know, right?! I thought we had it in the bag.
They should have run the ball more to control the clock instead of throwing so much.
I agree completely.  It seems we kept going 3 and out and giving the ball right back to the Patriots.
Yeah, you can't give Tom Brady the ball back.  He'll make you pay.
Tell me about it.  He definitely made us pay.  But, I'm looking forward to this season.  I think we had a good draft.
Oh really, who did you pick up?
Our first pick was a defensive end from UCLA.  His name is McKinley.  He'll help us pick up and play opposite Vic Beasley who's a beast.
Yeah, Beasley is awesome. Didn't he lead the league in sacks last year?
He did.  He had 15 and a half.  I hope he can do it again this year.
Yeah, that'd be cool.  I like the Falcons too.  I really like Julio Jones because I'm a big Alabama fan.
Yeah, we all knew he'd be really good.
I got to meet him one time and he's actually a really cool guy.
That's great.  The NFL could use some guys that help clean up their image.
Right, as opposed to guys that hit their girlfriends and wives and get away with it.
Totally!  The league needs to get guys like that out of the league!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite team?
I like the Packers.
Why do you like them?
I like that they are a small market team.
Yeah that is pretty cool.  There are no other professional sports in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
Yeah.  I like that they are publicly owned too.
I think they are also the only publicly owned team in the Big 4 sports.
Yeah, the city of Green Bay owns them.  It is pretty cool.
So there is no threat of the team moving to another town.
Yeah.  Hahaha.
A couple of years ago, the owner of the San Diego Chargers tried to sell the team to the city, but the NFL wouldn't let him.
That is interesting.
Yeah.  They can't have cities owning the teams.
If the cities owned the teams, the teams couldn't threaten to leave.
I wonder where NFL will threaten to take teams now that Los Angeles has teams.
I would bet London.
St. Louis would be a good bet too.
Yeah, but the NFL wants a team in London.
It would give it a global reach.
It sure would.  The schedule would be a nightmare for a London team though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the football season this year?
You know it, I can't wait for the Patriots to play.
I don't think they are going to do very good this year.
How could you say that? They just won the Super Bowl.
Time is finally going to catch up with Brady.
Ya he is getting up there in years.
He got hit pretty bad in the Super Bowl.
If they don't improve their line that could keep happening.
The AFC west looks like it's going to be pretty tough this year.
Belicheck will be able to make the changes that they need to prepare for that.
I don't even think they will make the playoffs this year.
There is no way they aren't going to make the playoffs.
First time since Brady's knee injury in 2008 they won't be there.
You're crazy.  I don't know where you come up with this stuff
Well maybe if they start cheating again and have another "spygate" or something.
That's what everyone goes to complaining about them cheating.
Well if you cheat people are going to bring it up.
If a team wins that's all that matters here in Boston.
Well I'll see you on Sunday and hopefully I'm wrong about my predictions.
I hope you are too bud.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, which team will you be rooting this NFL season?
I think I will be cheering on the Oakland Raiders.
Jalen Richard might help be a big help with for the Raiders this season.
Yeah, he was good last year for the Raiders.
I am hoping that the Seattle Seahawks do great this season.
They have the some of the best defense of any team.
I just hope Jimmy Graham can stay healthy this season.
Yep, I think he tore a tendon in the 2015 season.
But Graham came back stronger in the 2016 season.
It was miracle the injury was not made worse.
It was crazy how fast Graham was able to bounce back.
I think he was just very determine to make a fast recovery.
It's good that Russell Wilson was not hurt that season.
Having both him and Jimmy Graham playing together that season was great.
Did you know Andrew Luck might still be on the injured list?
Yep, he's the quarterback for the Colts.
I heard he was trying to make a full recovery to start this season.
So, is Dolphins center Mike Pouncey.
I didn't know Pouncey was in recovery mode.
I just found out three days ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
After watching last year's Super Bowl, it got me thinking. What is the biggest choke job in NFL history?
There were plenty of them. I do think that the Super Bowl last year was definitely the biggest choke job ever.
I would agree even though it's the most recent in memory.
For sure. How are you up 28-3 in the 3rd quarter and lose?
Not very easily. The odds of that happening were so astronomical that it's insane that it did happen.
The Patriots had to play perfect ball in the last quarter and a half and they did. Atlanta certainly helped them out a lot.
Atlanta's defense was so tired by the fourth quarter that you could just see it coming.
Surprising they were that exhausted with all of the training players do these days.
Doesn't help that New England continually runs the hurry up offense.
It certainly doesn't. Still can't believe the Falcons blew that game.
Me either. What other choke jobs come to mind?
Certainly the Bills coming back from 35-3 down in the 3rd quarter in 1993.
That is the ultimate deficit overcome and probably the biggest choke job until last year's Super Bowl, considering the stage.
Certainly. There were other large deficits overcome. I could think of the 49ers and Giants playoff game in 2002.
The Jeff Garcia comeback. I remember that game.
Remember when the field goal was botched and they pulled that guy down and nothing was called.
That was the holder that got pulled down, right?
I'm not sure. Either the holder or an offensive lineman.
That should have been pass interference, right?
I believe so. Who knows what the exact rule is when the offensive lineman is an eligible or ineligible receiver. I would think it should have been.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why is the Pro Bowl so bad?
I think its a sport that doesnt lend itself to exhbition.
So how could they improve it?
They cannot
The other leagues found ways
Right but this is different
How so?
You cant get physical in football because of the risk.
Would guaranteeing contracts help that out?
No because they almost already do that with signing bonuses.
OK I see what you are saying
And I think that they just need to do away with it altogether.
Or maybe make it flag football?
Yeah that would be better as well.
I think people would tune into that.
Its tough because the game is so intense.
People do watch preseason games.
They do but tune out once the starters go out
Maybe add some silly elements to it?
They have to come up with something quickly or else people will completely write it off
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you got your man cave done yet, the NFL season starts soon?
Yes, I got it painted, new lazyboy recliners and new big screen TV with surround sound done!
I can't wait for NFL Sundays to start back with the new set up.
Pre-season games start next month, I can't wait to break it in!
Me either, the kids will love watching the NFL games in the man cave too!
You think the Saints are gonna go all the way this year.
I hope! The Saints haven't been able to capture the magic they once had during the 2009 season.
Yes, the 2010 Saints super bowl win was magical for the team and the city of New Orleans.
That win really helped turn the city of New Orleans around after that devistating hurricane they had back in 2005.
Who is the Quarterback for the Saints.
Drew Brees is still the starting quarterback or at least has first dibs on the job.
Brees has been with the Saints for a long time now?
Yes, Drew Brees has been with the Saints since he came back from shoulder surgery back in 2006.
Who was Brees with before then?
Drew Brees originally played for the San Diego Chargers but they got rid of him after he had surgery.
That is funny since he went on to win the Super Bowl for the Saints.
Yes, and Brees will be a future hall of famer with all the stats he has put up with the Saints.
No doubt! Drew Brees has been great for the Saints and the city of New Orleans.
I hope the Saints have a great season!
I do to and hope it is another exciting year of NFL football in our new man cave!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any teams you expect to surprise us this year?
The LA Rams. They will have a new coach this year.
Whoa, a new coach? What happened to Jeff Fisher?
He was fired, They were 31-45 in his time with them.
So who is his replacement, then?
Sean McVay, Hes only 30, making him youngest head coach in NFL history.
That is great. The Rams could benefit from the energy a young guy like him could bring.
That's what I'm hoping. Would be nice to see the Rams take their division.
They showed flashes of promise last year; hopefully this is the year they can get it all together.
I'd love to see Detroit do well, too.
As a Packers fan, I disagree, haha!
Ha! Seriously though, they've got a good team.
They do, and they've been a threat in that division at times over the years.
Yes. So it would be nice to see them pull it off.
It's such a tough division. Packers, Bears, Vikings, Lions.
Yeah, the Vikings are another team I'd love to see go all the way.
They deserve it. I really thought the first season they had with Favre they would pull it off.
That was a heartbreaking season to watch.
Painful that it ended on a Favre interception. He had been so amazing that year.
Yeah, funny how one of the best seasons of his career came with the Vikings and not the Packers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the NFL needs to change?
I think they really need to work on their television production.
What do you mean?
They need to get rid of the 1000 commercials in a game.
It does make the games too long.
It's a commercial break after everything now.
What would you change from a rules perspective about the NFL?
I don't really know.  The rules of the game aren't bad right now.
Do you think they should call roughing the passer less?
I think you should be able to hit the quarterback without getting a penalty everytime.
Seems like if you touch Tom Brady that's a penalty.
I agree but if you kill someone like Jay Cutler isn't no penalty.
Well the NFL has protect their golden boy Brady.
I get protecting the quarterback but it really affects the game unfairly.
I wish the rules were like in the 70s.
Oh you mean where you could basically kill someone?
It was a mans game back then.
Yeah but there were a lot more injuries.
Hey it's football not ballet.
I think the NFL has done a pretty good job of adjusting the rules.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm starting my fantasy football team soon.
It's not bad enough that you watch it incessantly you also spend every second of free time with that fantasy stuff.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing, I guess. But did you ever notice most football fans look as if they've never done anything physical in their lives other than life a beer glass?
Are you commenting on my physique?
If the shoe fits ... or should I say 'if the pants are tight ...'
Once again, you're mean.
I was just teasing. Lord knows I'm the last person to talk. I just dislike sports.
You don't like them at all?
I'm a fair weather fan. I only have an interest if they are in the play offs.
That is fair weather.
Well, Minnesota fans kind of suck anyway so I fit right in.
Why do you say that?
I recall on Fran Tarkenton's very last game, after years of performing for these people, he made a bad play and these 'fans' booed him off the field.
That's cold blooded.
Sure is. Even as a sports hating little kid I knew they were in the wrong.
Don't you think they've gotten better?
Nope.
You're so cynical.
I'm a realist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you excited for the upcoming Raiders season?
Yeah absolutely! We now have Marshawn Lynch to pick up the slack in the running game.
I can't believe he came out of retirement to come back and play for us!
I didn't think he was gonna stay idle for long, he still has some left in the tank.
I do think Beast mode will be a great compliment to the offense.
Agreed. Carr no longer has to rely solely on the passing game as he can now just hand it off.
I just hope that none of these guys get hurt and ruin the season.
We shall see, nothing we can really do to prevent that.
I just think this is finally our season. I am tired of watching a build up and then fall off from the Raiders.
Let's just hope some of the other teams in the west don't make any blockbuster moves.
Well Seattle is still really good, and you can't ever count out Russell Wilson and the Legion of Boom
Yeah they seem to always make the right moves and always stay in the playoff hunt.
Arizona Cardinals are always good too. I just don't think Carson Palmer will lead them to the promised land.
I don't think its him we need to worry about. David Johnson had an amazing season and will test teams with his style of play.
What do you think of Goff and the Rams this year?
He should have a bounceback season, but I don't think the Rams will be much of contenders this year.
Anyone else we should be worried about in our division?
Nah, not really. The niners are done for, and with Kapernick's antics, that team is doomed.
I can't wait for this season to start!
Me either. Black and silver all the way!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Buffalo Bills of the 90s?
Is that the team that went to the Super Bowl 4 times in a row?
Yeah, that's them.
Yes, that was devastating to watch.
Yeah, it seemed like they lost to the Cowboys a lot.
Them and the Giants.
Why do you think they kept losing?
Bad luck. Missed kick here, dropped pass there.
Yeah, and the Cowboys were really good back then.
Yes, they were.
Who was the QB for the Bills back then?
Jim Kelly
That's right. He was pretty good.
Yeah, had some good position players too.
Thurman Thomas?
Yes, he was the running back.
Man, must be tough to be a Bills fan.
Oh yeah, a lot of heartache out there.
Yeah, plus football is big in Buffalo.
Oh yeah, cold weather city.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about some of the new rules in the NFL?
I don't really have a problem with much of the new rules. But I do hate how players get penalized for celebrating.
I think some celebrating is okay, but I really hate when players go overboard.
Yeah, but to me, that's what makes the game fun. I like seeing the over the top celebrations from some players.
I don't. Some of these guys act like clowns.
Well, I would figure that scoring a touchdown in the NFL would be exciting.
Yeah, but these players are getting paid good money to do their jobs. They need to act more professional.
I do think some celebrations need to be banned. But for the most part, let these guys have some fun.
I guess one of the problems I have with it is that it takes too much time away from the game.
That's something I can agree with you on. If a celebration stalls the game too much, then it should be penalized.
Other than celebrations, you don't have a problem with the other rules?
No, not really. What new rules do you not like?
I was never a fan of kickoffs being done so far into the field. It pretty much eliminates most returns.
I do agree with that. But I think they did that because too many people were getting hurt from kickoff returns.
But that's part of the game. To me, if it's exciting, I want to watch it.
I don't know. I would rather players stay healthy so I can watch them actually play.
But kickoffs are part of the game. The NFL has already been too soft with so many of the things that used to be legal in the sport.
Yeah, it is frustrating to watch some of the rules that prevent defensive players to play like defensive players.
Exactly. I want to watch a sport where football players have the freedom to play.
So more violence is acceptable to you, but celebrations are over the top? Okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Football season is coming up!
Yeah, I'm stoked. Preseason starts in August, I think.
What do you think of the rookies?
I don't really know. We'll have to wait and see if there's another Dak Prescott this year.
Speaking of which, do you think the Cowboys will be as good?
Honestly, I think they'll be better than last year.
Oh yeah? Why?
They've still got the best O-Line in the game.
That's true.
Their offense will probably only get better with more chemistry.
Defense is still an issue for them though.
Yeah, I think they meant to address that in free agency and the draft this year though.
It's crazy that Dak and Zeke were in MVP talks as rookies though.
Seriously. Dallas really lucked out in drafting both of those guys.
I think Tony Romo will be a good broadcaster though.
Probably. Why?
He's a charismatic guy, and he's gotta be used to being in front of a camera by now.
Makes sense. I'll be sure to watch.
Looking like a good season.
For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Patriots will win the SUperbowl again this year.
No I think someone else will get it.
WHo do you think.
I think maybe the falcons or the cowboys.
I think the cowboys could be in the championship.
I agree or the Steelers.
What about the Giants?
Maybe
The Seahawks maybe.
If they got new players then yes.
I think it may surprise us.
I hope so.
NFL needs a new team a fresh face to get up there.
I would like to see the Browns do better/
Me too.
It would amaze alot of people.
I agree they only won one or two last season.
YEah I think they should do better.
The Bengals could go far.
They are a good team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you know when the preseason games start?
Im not sure i can check for you
Thanks i am thinking of buyig tickets to one for my family.
August 3 at 7 pm Cowboys and Cardinales
Does it say where they are playing
I dont see it on this page.
I will need to get my information when i go to get tickets.
Who do you want to go see?
My husband is a Saints fan but the kids and i root for the Steelers.
He has got to hate that.
Yes especially snce the Steelers have 6 superbowl wins compared to the Saints 1.
Definatly makes him mad when you rub that one in.
Yes and when the Steelers make the playoff we start hanging terrible towels around the house and other Steelers items we have collected over the years.
I am so glad my husband doesnt support a different team.
Who do you two like.
We both like the Patriots.
Ugh dont say that in my house my husband hates them especially Tom Brady
Maybe ill bring some Patriots posters to your house.
He might have a heart attack.
He would probably stat yelling at me and take them off the walls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here's a story of a man named Brady.....
No.
Oh come on, why not?
Because Miami does not have to play them in regular season until December.
I know, but whay the lack of love for Tom Brady?
I'm just burnt out over the New England Dynasty.
Why burned out?
Because it seem like no other QB can put a patch on him and all for different bad reasons.
So Tom Brady can't be "Just that good"?
I think Cam Newton needs to knock him off his pedistal.
No one other than Cam has a shot?
Matt Ryan maybe.
What about RG III?
No, he's more hype than hope.
I know, i know..... Aaron Rodgers!
Please, stop. Another hype artist.
Drew Brees.
Now there is a possibility. But that would mean the saints would dominate the division and that would be bad for Tampa.
Well if it means the demise of the Brady career......
I hear ya.... i'm on the fence with that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really excited about the Raiders this season.
Are they moving to Las Vegas yet?
Not yet, that won't be until 2020.
For some reason I thought it was going to be next year. Either way, I'm also excited about the Raiders this season.
They overachieved last year and were looking really good until the unfortunate Derek Carr injury.
That was the turning point for their season. Derek Carr is so good.
I agree, he was the heart and soul of their team and I think when he went down the sails went out on their season.
It didn't help that the backup quarterback also got hurt.
Yeah that late in the season going into the post season playoffs was rough with that situation.
I thought Michael Crabtree looked really good too.
He definitely had a resurgence and Derek Carr certainly made him look good.
The Raiders defense was so good last year! I hope they were able to maintain and keep everyone.
The key defensive players are intact and they also added Jelani Jenkins.
Jelani was on the Dolphins last year right.
Yeah he was on the Dolphins. He'll help solidify their linebacker core.
What about offense aren't you excited about Cordarrelle Patterson and Jared Cook along with of course the BEAST, Marshawn Lynch?
That's obviously excitement from me without question. I'm also really pleased with the signing of EJ Manuel as a backup quarterback in case of something unfortunate happening again.
Oh that's right they also picked up EJ. That's a smart move especially since backup quarterback was so thin in depth for them last season.
I'm looking forward to the season as I expect the Raiders to be on top of the division again. I don't see the Denver Broncos, Chargers being much of a threat, but the Kansas City Chiefs will be tough again.
It'll be a fun season out there in the AFC West again, it'll be exciting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to have the best offense in the NFL this year?
That is a tough question, there are a few good options.
Yes, but there are some obvious choices.
For sure. The Falcons should really be able to put up some point.
I agree. Julio Jones is unstoppable.
Yes, he is too tall for a lot of the defenders.
I know what you mean. He can have 3 guys covering him and he can still jump higher to catch the ball.
I also think that the Tampa Bay Bucks are going to break out this year.
I agree. They added D. Jackson, his deep threat is going to open the field up for Mike Evans.
Yes, Mike Evans is another big bodied receiver. He will be great this year.
Do you have a third team that will have a top offense?
Perhaps Green Bay will be back in form this year.
That is quite possible.
Jordy Nelson should be fully healed, and they got rid of Eddie Lacy.
Yeah, Lacy was not as good as he could have been on that team.
I hope the Seahawks can get him running right this year.
If any team can it will be them
I know, they are built to run and run all day long.
Yes, their defense takes a lot of time off the clock, and so does running the ball.
Yes, faster pace teams struggle against them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL season is coming up soon!
That's right it is!
Who do you think will be a sleeper team this season?
I have a weird feeling that the Chargers are going to be a surprise
They definitely drafted players for Philip Rivers to utilize.
They have to. He only has a few years left.
It's crazy that he's the only quarterback out of the main three from the draft to not have a ring
Who were the others again? Big Ben and Eli
Yeah those are the ones. It would be nice if he won a ring  finally
I agree, but that defense is still kind of so-so.
Yeah I doubt they will win it all, but I think they will grab a wild card spot
I think they will, but they will probably lose in the first round
Just so sad that Marlon McCree single-handedly stopped Rivers from winning that ring.
All he had to do was give himself up and it was a done deal.
Those early 2000 Charger teams were amazing
Shaun Phillips and Merriman were completely unstoppable
Yeah, then you had V-Jax and LT.
I miss watching LT dominate every time he touched the ball.
I just realized he never won a ring as well.
So many great chargers players may end up saying the same thing. Such a shame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer passing or running plays in the NFL?
I prefer passing.
I also prefer passing.
I think the running game is important though.
It is, but the passing is more fun to watch.
Did you see some of the hail Mary passes Aaron Rogers has thrown.
I have.
Some of those passes are nuts.
It is pure luck that his receiver catches the ball.
Of course it is.
But it is neat how far he can throw.
And how accurate.
What do you mean accurate?
Think about throwing fifty yards and not being the field of play or out of bounds.
True.  I never thought of it like that.
Most people don't.
Still the receiver has to make one heck of a play.
Yes they do.
It helps to have a tall receiver.
And one that can jump very very high.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you want to win the Superbowl this year?
I definitely want the Detroit Lions to win.
Do you think they have a chance, coming off that disappointing first round loss in the playoffs.
Well I think they took a step forward last year, even with the loss of Megatron.
Yes, but Matthew Stafford pretty much carried the team, he can't do that every year.
Well, they had alot of injuries, so he was forced to.
So you think they can do it, if they stay healthy.
I'm hopeful that they can.
I definitely want the Cowboys to take it home.
Did you hear about the recent news with Dak Prescott?
No, what happened?
He used an auto-pen to sign a bunch of football cards.
Well that's kind of immoral.
Yeah, and it's been a week and he hasn't said anything about it.
He's probably waiting for his lawyers to release a statement, what about the card manufacturers?
No, Panini hasn't said anything either.
Well that's a bad situation, but I still want them to win.
If Dak and Ezekiel can have a crazy sophomore season, I think there's a chance.
Me too, hopefully they can keep the off field issues under control.
It'd be crazy if Dak got suspended for it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Honey, wake up!
What? What's happening?
You were dreaming again.
Dreaming? And you woke me up?
You were having another nightmare.
I was?
It was obvious.
What do you mean?
Well, first you let out a horrific scream...
I screamed again?
Yes. And then you started to perspire terribly.
I uess my pajamas are a bit moist...
And then you began to sob uncontrollably.
Not again.
Yeas. Again.
Some day you will get over it. Some day you will recover and your nightmares will be a thing of the past.
You think so?
Yes dear.  Now go back to sleep.
OK. Thanks dear.
And stop crying over the retirement of Peyton Manning. The Denver Broncos will just have to live without him, and you will too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you see winning the NFC North division?
I'm going with Green Bay.
Hard to bet against Aaron Rodgers.
Exactly. When in doubt, take the best Quarterback.
Green Bay has shown some cracks in the armor, though.
Agreed, but I'm not convinced that either Detroit or Minnesota quite have what it takes.
You didn't mention the Bears.
For a reason! They're probably going to struggle.
Yeah, probably another tough year for Chicago.
I do think the Vikings have a chance to be special.
Their defense has the potential to be great.
I love their defense. A lot of solid playmakers.
But the question is whether they can figure it out offensively.
Which translates to the Quarterback position.
Yep. Is Teddy Bridgewater healthy?
Bridgewater's out for all of 2017. And he's a free agent.
Sad. He was a promising young quarterback, but that injury was terrible.
Yeah, it's another NFL injury story.
Without stability at the QB position, I think I agree that Green Bay is winning the NFC North.
In the end, always bet on the Quarterback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many games do they play in an NFL season?
They play 16 games each season.
Has it always been that many? Seems like it was less than that.
It was less than that a long time ago. I think it's be 16 since the 80's.
How many games does a team need to win to get to the Superbowl?
Wow! A team probably needs around 12 wins to make it to the Superbowl.
Are you including all the post season games?
Yeah. I think there's three round you got to win to get to the Superbowl.
What about regular season game? How many do you think they need to make it into the post season?
They probably need to at leas win 8. Around fifty percent of their games.
What teams do you think stand a chance this year?
The Patriots, The Panthers, and maybe The Falcons.
I was hoping the Browns were going to get there this year.
It would be nice, but that would be an extreme long shot.
What makes you think they don't have a chance?
You have to have a team of good players not just one or two.
I think they have a few good players. What about Joe Thomas?
He's probably their best offensive lineman. Still he's going to need more help.
Well they also have Joe Haden. He can help.
That's still only two. Everybody else still needs to prove themselves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm struggling who to pick for my fantasy team.
At which position?
TE.  I don't know what to do.
How could you not go with Gronk?
Don't get me wrong, I want to choose him.
Okay, so what's the dilemma?
Even though he's the obvious best TE, I can't rely on him.
You mean health-wise?
Exactly.  He's the most imposing tight end in history, but can't stay on the field.
His injuries do scare me a bit.
If not for that, I would arguably take him in the first round as he piles up catches and TD's.
Are there any good alternatives?
Travis Kelce had a sneaky good year last year.
For the Chiefs, right?
Yep, he was a favorite target there.
The advantage to him is that he's not injury plagued.
Exactly.  That's what I need.
It would be a shame to draft Gronk and have his backup handle all the starts.
Yeah, I'm just conflicted.  I'll need to sleep on it to make a decision.
When in doubt, trust your heart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football season's starting soon.
Yes it is. I've got my Sunday's booked then.
How're the Bears looking this year?
They're a mess, as usual.
Yeah, why so?
Starting at the top, the QB situation is questionable at best.
Don't believe in Mike Glennon?
I think he's okay, but there's a reason he's been a back up for a while.
What about Trubiskey?
The rookie? I hope they don't rush him?
But if Glennon does poorly, the fans will call for him.
Yeah, but there's no point in throwing a rookie into the fire with a weak team.
True, letting Alshon Jeffrey leave didn't help.
He's a top receiver for any team, but he might be a waste on the Bears.
I think he'll do well with the Eagles this year.
I hope so. I really do like him.
He can really play, bummer about the Bears though.
I'm thinking last in the division this year.
I guess we'll find out.
I guess so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
RGIII
BOBBY LEE! Haha.
Yes, one in the same. Lets bring him to the table.
Sounds good. I'll Start. Born in 1990
Yes, but do you know WHERE he was born?
Sure do, Okinawa, Japan.
That's right. Technically he can claim he's Japaneese.
Haha, true.
Somehow he made it to Texas where he played High School Football.
That's right. He had a career right out of the gate.
Yes, he passed for 2,001 yards and 25 touchdowns with 2 interceptions in High School.
Outstanding.
When he wasn't playing Football he ran track.
Track? Really?
Yup. He broke records in that arena as well. He broke state records for the 110-meter and 300-meter hurdles.
No way!
It's True. Then he played at Baylor and then.... the NFL!
Yup, Redskins and then the Browns.
He makes the Browns altho i miss him at Washington.
Yes, i thought he was doing well with the Redskins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What NFL team is gonna win it all next year?
I think this is the Vikings year.
Really?
Yes, I love their team.
They have not been good since Culpepper
Don't forget Carter and Moss.
They had a good team back then
They still do
So you are a big Minnesota fan?
Yes
Who else do you like?
I like the Packers
They are from Green Bay right?
Yes
I like their team
I miss Brett Favre though
He was great
Yeah, he might be the best quarterback ever.
I agree
I think Tom Brady could give him a run for his money though
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts about the Cardinals?
You know I think they actually are going to put it toegether this year.
I agree.
The have done a great job drafting and developing players
Its been sneaky though.
Its sort of slow and steady over the last few years
I just worry about Palmer
I know. He is still good but I don't know how much longer than can ride that horse.
He certainly looks like he has lost some arm strength
But with a defense like that around him...
Yeah, no kidding.
They play great D
If they could only get some consistency  otherwise they would be dagerous
I wonder what the solution to Larry Fitz will be in the future.
No kidding. I think they need to stop looking for the next one of him.
And just find a good receiver...
Exactly!
I wish teams wouldn't try to replace a role player with someone in that same role.
Its impossible
And it never works
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, let's talk football. You're a Colts fan, right?
Yep, born and raised.
What do you think about the latest Peyton scandal?
You mean about how they might have used hearing aids twenty years ago?
That's the one. It's against the rules.
That depends largely on whether they were electronic or not.
So, you don't think they cheated?
Oh, I'm sure the Colts cheat as much as any other team.
Even the Patriots?
Well, the Pats just get caught cheating more often.
That's because they are winners. Nobody cares if losers cheat.
How true. If you cheat and still lose...
Well, the season they are talking about with Peyton was not a great one.
He has had several scandals now, though. The HGH 'for his wife's, the sexual assault in college, the hearing aids.
Yes, and now we have Brady's concussion scandal, as well.
I think that is an important one. The players shouldn't be playing with concussions.
Yeah, but it's also their brains to make that decision. They ought to know the consequences.
That's the power of the culture. Winning is everything.
Until they retire and lose the ability to walk.
The smart ones get in and make some money and leave before they get too beat up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best wide receiver in the NFL right now?
Antonio Brown is the best.
Are you sure? He is good but is he the best?
Statistically yes, he gets open all the time
Don't you think Roethlisberger has a lot to do with that?
Of course but it is part of the game, a great QB usually makes great WR
I wonder how good he would be if he was on the Jets.
Considering they have no QB, I would say awful
You are making my case for me by saying that.
A WR cant throw to themselves so a QB is a necessity.
What about Randy Moss? He got open on many teams regardless of who the QB was
Did you forget about his time with the Raiders?
He had one great year with over 1000 yds and 8 TDs with the Raiders
But his second year was awful. Especially considering how much they gave up to get him
So do you think Moss is worse than Brown?
Not a chance, Moss was better but Brown is great in his own way
Yeah it is hard to compare them both since the size comparison is different.
Plus Moss played until he was 35 years old
True, Brown could come close is statistics when it is all said and done
Unlikely, Moss was too good early in his career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow the NFL?
I love it.
Where do you usually watch the games?
I go to my local bar.
That's cool.  What's your team?
I am a Panther's fan.  You?
I love the Redskins.
How do you feel about their team name?  Are you in favor of changing it.
I don't know.  There is a lot of nostalgia, but I also think it is insensitive.
I used to be a redskins fan until the Panthers came to Charlotte.
Are you pleased with Cam Newton?
I think he is a great quarterback.
Yeah, but he had a rough year.
The year before was awesome.
That's true.
They made it all the way to the superbowl.
You must have been disappointed.
Yeah, but not as much as being a Redskins fan.
I hear you.
I'm just joking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to the Bengals last year?
Half of their receivers left. AJ Green was hurt most of the year.
Really shows you what kind of impact big playmakers have on success.
Most definitely, big play ability is what makes most good teams good.
Is Dalton the future?
I don't know. I am starting to have doubts.
What about McCarron?
He's a good game manager but without multiple big time weapons around him I don't see him producing big numbers.
The defense is almost good enough to make up for that though.
Almost is not good enough.
Yeah,  you're right.
And Burfict and Jones miss a few games a year because of this malfeasance or that.
Why can't the Bengals get that squashed?
I have no idea bro.. But it's every single year and it's frustrating.
With a basically healthy and full defensive roster for an entire season could they get it done?
With some of the new draft additions and a healthy tight end position I say yes.
It's tough to be a Bengals fan when they are in the playoffs most years but can't win a playoff game.
Yup, the wildcard game against Pittsburgh two years ago about ended my fandom.
I feel ya', and it was Burfict and Jones.
If the Who Deys could clean it up just a little more they would achieve playoff success.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know some people call football an American past time, but it seems popular all over the world.
Why's that?
I read about how the prime minister of Israel met with a bunch of NFL Hall Of Famers.
Netanyahu? I didn't know he was a football fan.
The Patriot's team owner took a bunch of them for a tour.
That would be really cool to see.
Apparently the team owner was joking with the prime minister about him playing.
Wow, Netanyahu actually plays football?
Yeah, the owner gave him a ball and they were tossing it back and forth.
I wonder where he learned to play?
Netanyahu went to school in the States, and that's where he picked up football.
I always thought it was funny how in Europe they call soccer football.
It does seem confusing. But really, soccer is playing with a ball with your foot, so it is more logical.
As devoted as they are to soccer, Europe has built some really great teams with great players.
They are VERY devoted to soccer in Europe. It's like the MAIN sport, whereas here you have competition between football, basketball, and baseball as to which is the favorite.
With the way they are spread out over the seasons, it makes it easy to be a fan of all three.
I know. And there's hockey, but that always falls behind the big three for favorite sport.
I personally love baseball the best. I think most people would pick it as number one.
It would be a toss up I think between baseball and football. Basketball would probably be in third place.
I agree, basketball defintely falls behind baseball and football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think a lot of football players have some really cool nicknames.
Like William, the Refrigerator, Perry.,
Did you know he already weighed 200 pounds when he was only eleven years old?
That's massive.
I always liked the name Broadway Joe Namath.
I think it was fitting for him.
Remember the cheesy Noxzema commercial he did?
That was pretty funny.
What about Dick Lane who was known as the Night Train?
Let me guess. It was because he ran over people like a train?
Actually no. It's because he would travel by train to out of town games because he was afraid of flying.
I would not have guessed that one.
What about The Assassin?
You mean Jack Tatum? I would be afraid to play against him given his reputation.
I think a really sweet one is Lance, Bambi, Alworth.
I don't think I would like that nickname if I was a football player. You know a really cool one?
What?
The Nigerian Nightmare.
That was really fitting for Christian Okoye.
Especially since he was really from Nigeria.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite team?
Definitely the Packers!
Oh, you're a cheesehead!
I don't really get into the cheesehead stuff, but I love the team.
My father likes them. He said they won the first super bowl.
Yes, they beat the Chiefs. It wasn't called super bowl, though.
Really? What was it called?
It was just a championship game.
When did it become super bowl?
The next game, played in 1968.
Who was in that game?
The Packers and Raiders, and the Packers won again.
So they won the first two championship games ever?
Yes.
Where did the super bowl name come from?
I read that Lamar Hunt from the Chiefs named it because his kid was playing with a super ball during the first game.
Too bad the Packers still beat them.
Packers will always rule!
Did you ever see go them play?
Yes, in 2015. I even got a ball signed by Clay Matthews!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team jersey do you like?
The colts
Which team do you like the least?
The patriots. Seem to win a lot
Are there teams which share their field with baseball
Used to in Philadelphia. Not sure
Should football start later in the year.
No. The schedule seem to be working
Why do you like about going to a professional football game?
Cheering the team with thousand of people.
Which team has the most potential this year?
New Orleans
Should Las Vegas have a football team?
Why not. It has almost everything else.
Is football good for the country
Definitely an american tradition, like apple pie. Particularly on Thanksgiving.
Should Washington get a new stadium?
Soon, It is starting to get old
Do you know where the next superbowl is going to be?
I think in the new stadium where Minnesota is playing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the most famous players in the NFL from the University of Michigan?
That's easy! Tom Brady is the most famous Wolverine in the NFL.
True, but who else?
Can I list past or present players?
Both!
Okay, thanks. The next most famous player would be Desmond Howard.
The Heisman trophy winner?
Yes, he's famous for striking the Heisman pose.
Any other famous Wolverines in the NFL?
Yes, there's definitely more.
Like who?
Probably the most famous defensive player is Charles Woodson.
The cornerback?
Yes, and he also returned some punts.
He was a "two-way" player. Such players are rare today.
He's also the last player to win the Heisman who was neither a quarterback nor a running back.
Wow, he must be a great athlete!
I think so. Jabrill Peppers is the only other Wolverine with Charles' athleticism.
What makes Jabrill so special?
He, at one point, played 15 different positions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could play any position in football what would you choose.
I would be a quarterback.
Yeah, that would be exciting.
I'd be in control of all the action.
Everyone would be cheering you on.
It must be high pressure too.
That would be intimidating.
Yes, but I'd have such confidence it would be cool.
Who would you like to pass to?
I would pass to Smith or Huff.
Wow, can you imagine?
That would be so cool!
What team would you want to beat the most?
I'd want to beat the Patriots.
They would be my team to beat too.
How often do they practice?
They are always working out, planning out plays, and smashing their bodies.
It is hard work!
I'd love to have football muscles, though.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season to start!
When is week one?
The first game is September 7th.
Who is playing opening night?
New England is playing Kansas City I believe.
Oh man, the Patriots are going to dominate this year.
Yeah, they are even better than last year.
I can't believe they got rid of Blount after all he did for them.
I think that anybody could thrive in that offense.
Even that bum on Jacksonville?
Who are you talking about? Yeldon?
Yeah, he has been such a disappointment.
I still like him though, but he is no Marshawn Lynch.
Marshawn! I am excited to see him get back at it.
Yeah, he is such a beast! Such a dynamic playmaker.
Beast mode in the bay area! I'm happy he got to play where he wanted to.
Oakland is going to be nice this year.
Yeah they are. Carr developing and a veteran back to help him out.
It's too bad the Patriots will win again this year.
Yeah, another ring for the dark lord. Oh well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whew this rough

What are you doing

Yes?
I am trying to win a season as the briwns
Why
Because it will be funny
But that's your answer
To what
Why your losing
What?
The browns suck
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite player.Charles Stillman was too good.
He was the absolute best at the punch or stripping of the football.
Every time he got near the ball carrier I'd be yelling "Hang on to the BALL!!!!"
He really was one of the all time greats in the league on and off the field too.
I have the same admiration for him as I do Fitz. Seemingly a stand up guy on and off the field.
Not too flashy but steady and dangerous. Never heard a bad word about him and definitely a guy I would've wanted on my team.
The bears teams of 200-2010 always seemed to do a lot for the city of Chicago and the state honestly.
Peanut also won the Walter Payton Man of the Year as well didn't he?
Yes he did, so well deserved.
Kansas City went 12-4 last year and won the AFC West. Why aren't they being viewed as a more serious threat in the AFC?
Obviously the Patriots are the heavy favorites to represent the AFC,
The Chiefs have the formula to beat Brady, with a strong defensive line and an offense that can keep Brady off the field.
consensus seems to be that the Raiders, Steelers, and even Ravens are bigger threats to New England.
the Chiefs gave Brady his worst loss in almost a decade in a 41-14 blowout.
Why aren't the Chiefs viewed as a bigger threat in the AFC?
They managed to lose a home playoff game where the opposing team didn't score a TD.
which teams do you expect your teams record to be at the end of this upcoming season?
We have a tough schedule, especially the first four
Can't wait for the super bowl.
Watch out 2018! Here we come!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the superbowl this year?
I think the Packers have a good chance.
Why do you think that?
Aaron Rodgers is one of the best Qb's in the entire league
I agree with that but they have some weaknesses
Yeah I agree with that too, their defense isn't very good
Unfortunately I completely agree, there are certainly better defensive teams
Also, they are consistently hurt at the most important time
Yeah last year their offensive line main men went down
That's the problem with a lot of teams
Who else do you think may win?
I think the Patriots always have a good chance under Bellicheck
Yeah I think they may already be the favorites
They have a strong defense and offense
Yes but the most important thing that really sets them apart is their coaching
Yeah, Bellicheck has won like 5 superbowls in the last 10 years
Never without Brady though
Yeah but I can see Brady sticking around for a while
We shall see
Goodluck to my favorite team, the patriots!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, you ready for the NFL to start.
Oh yeah, I got a feeling my Raiders are gonna go all the way!
LOL what makes you say that?
David Carr is the truth!
He sure signed a deal like he was the truth.
Yeah isn't he the highest paid player in the NFL right now?
I think so. About 25 million a year.
When you have a good quarterback like that, you have to lock him up though.
Yeah, even if you land a decent quarterback, you have to lock him up.
You're right about that, kind of like Andy Dalton in Cinci.
Exactly like Dalton.
That's the biggest curse an NFL team could have.  Landing a "decent" NFL quarterback. Because you still have to pay him big bucks.
Yeah, and once you pay him the big bucks, there's no money left for support players.
Look at the Seahawks, they were great when Russell was new and only getting like 500k a year.
Right, because they were able to spend money elsewhere, on support players.
Yeah it's hard to keep a good roster together when you're paying one player a ton of money.
Yeah but the Raiders will still be really good this year.
I'll agree with you on that, they still have a good line and a decent defense, but they're paying a few players too much.
Marshawn joining them is gonna be huge for this year though.
Agreed, after that though they'll probably gonna fall apart as they lose key players to free agency from not being able to pay them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
I love my Pats!
Really?  Me too!
Pats all the way this year!
Just like every year!
Yea buddy!
People hate on us all the time for liking the Pats
Yea but they're just jealous
I agree.  Pure jealousy
And they keep trying to say that we cheat
Like with the deflated ball?
Yea, man!
Pure jealousy again!
I totally agree!
Yea there will always be haters
Yea, that's just how it goes
Good talk man!
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are you expecting for the upcoming NFL season?
I expect business as usual, Patriots, Seahawks, Falcons, Cowboys dominating the season.
No surprise teams coming out?
Well the Raiders might end up doing good.
I personally think that the Titans are going to be a force this season.
Yes, Marcus Mariota is a very exciting player.
I just wish my Texans are able to take a step forward.
There defense is very good, I think they will do pretty great in the upcoming season.
I hope you are right.
Yeah, they will be a solid playoff team and a dark horse to get to the Super Bowl.
That would be great if that happened.
Are you going to attend any Texans games this season?
I don't think so, I am so busy with work, are you going to go to any games this season.
Yes, I will head to a Cardinals game when I visit home around Thanksgiving.
Wow that sounds fun, the Cardinals can do good this season.
Yeah, but I don't think they can unseat the Seahawks in the division.
You never know, anything can happen.
I suppose, but we will need a lot to go right for that to happen.
Well let's just wait and see, not too long until the season begins.
Yup! Looking forward to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
two more weeks until training camp.
dude, who cares about training camp?
that means that the season is close behind.
man, talk to me when the preseason starts.
i think that's like the first week of august.
yeah i know.
i like training camp because you can get a feel of how your team will be.
man, that's for the coaches and stuff.
naw dude. i be going out to the eagles training camp.
what?
they used to have camp at leheigh university campus, but now it's at the stadium.
and?
and it's free and open to the public. i be going.
you got too much time on your hands.
naw. i just love my nfl football.
me too but i don't be going to training camp and stuff.
because you're not a real fan.
dude, you know what fan is short for don't you?
no. what?
fanatic. you are a football fruity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this game
What about it
It's close
How is it close
It is just tense
Whatcha mean
The score keep going back and forth
Sounds tense
It is very much so
What teams winning now
The colts are in the lead
Who are they beating
The redskins this time
This time?
Well you know
I know what
They'll win every time
Nah
Yes man
Maybe
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?
Are we talking current players or of all time?
All time is fine.
I'd go for John Elway personally.
Thats a good choice but I think Peyton Manning is better.
No disrespect to Manning but I don't think he holds a candel to Elway.
Why do you say that?
He set records and was a trail blazer for future generations.
Yeah I get that buy Manning has long since beat Elway's records.
Yes but Elway was a fan favorite. Manning is as well but people will tell you Elway had much more charisma.
For me it's down to statistics. I don't rally care too much about character.
I feel the opposite. I think character means almost everything in terms of being the greatest.
We would have two completely different lists then.
I don't think so. It might be more similar than you think.
Alright lets see then. Name two more quarterbacks that you feel are on Elway's level.
Dan Marino  and Brett Farve.
I'd agree with both of those actually.
See I told you.
Yeah you win this arguement.
I always do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you like the NFL?
Yeah I love it.
Cool me too.
Who is your team?
I like the Panthers.  You?
I'm a 49ers fan.
Oh okay cool.
Yep.
Do you play fantasy football?
Yeah my buddies and I have a league.  You play?
Yeah I love it.
What do you like most about it?
I guess that I can play with friends and that it's competitive.  What about you?
I like that it keeps me interested in all the games, not just one or two big ones.
Yeah I know what you mean.
When you're kicker needs a few points you will watch the most boring game just to see it.
Yep that is right, I feel the same way.
Good talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The NFL season is getting really close!
I can not wait to go watch the Indianapolis Colts play!
Do you plan on going to a lot of their games this year?
Yea, my wife and I usually go to three or four home games each year.
I have not been back ever since they cut ties with Peyton Manning.
I hated their decision to do that. I wish that management would have handled that situation differently.
I think they just did it to get Andrew Luck in the draft that year.
You are probably right about that actually.
I still can not find it in my heart to forgive the franchise for that.
So, you are not a Colts fan anymore?
Nope! I quit watching them all together after they did that to Manning.
Wow, I do not think I could ever do that for any reason!
Manning done so much for this franchise, I could not believe they would just let him go the way they did.
I know what you mean, I loved Peyton myself and did not feel he was done right by the organization.
What made me really mad was the fact that he still had a few really good years left in him.
I feel that he should have been able to retire as a Colt.
While he was winning a Superbowl with Denver, the Colts did not even make the playoffs.
Yea it has pretty much been a struggle for us ever since he left.
Maybe one day I can find it in my heart to forgive and forget, but not yet.
I hope so, I know how much you love the Colts deep down.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite football team?
In the NFL or soccer?
The NFL.
It would have to be the Miami Dolphins.
Why is that your favorite team?
Because they had a perfect season.
But that was a long time ago.
And it has never been repeated.
It almost was.
By who?
By the Patriots.
But they didn't win the most important game.
They won other important games.
By cheating!
False accusations!
I'd do anything for the Dolphins to start winning again.
Even cheat?
No!
I used to like the Dolphins.
I used to too, still do, but used to too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you watch the NFL?
sometimes but not often.
who do you like?
i like the Seattle Seahawks.
why is that?
i like the quarterback.
i forgot his name.
its Russel Wilson.
why do you like him?
he went to NC State.
isnt that your alma mater?
yes! hes awesome.
didnt he transfer though.
yes, he went to Wisconsin after NC State.
Oh yeah.
who do you like?
i like the Carolina Panthers.
why is that?
im from Charlotte.
you gotta support the home team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the NFC East this upcoming season?
I think the Cowboys will repeat.
Really, why do you think that?
Dak Prescott and Ezekial Elliot will only get better in the second year.
I think Philadelphia will surprise.
I doubt it the Cowboys still have a great offensive line.
But the defense stinks you'll see.
Cowboys will go deep into the playoffs.
I think this will be a back to reality year for Dak Prescott.
I thought he looked like the real last year.
Carson Wentz will come on this year the Eagles have upgrades in many positions.
They may do a little better but I still think they do not lead the East.
The wide receivers should be much better this year and I think the defense will improve some.
The cowboys have the new trio Dak, Ezekial, and Dez.
I always thought Dez Bryant was over rated.
He's a good receiver who opens up the field.
The Eagles also drafted a great new DL Darek Barnett.
Don't think he will have a big impact in year one.
He could be the next Reggie White.
We will see.  They never won it all even with Reggie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about NFL football.
Okay.
What is your favorite team?
The Patriots.
Amazing team.
Yeah I like Malcom Brown.
Interesting choice.
Yeah surprised I did not say Brady?
Yeah.
He is my second favorite, how about that?
Okay that is better.
Have you been to the Super Bowl?
Yes I have been a few times.
A few times? Wow.
Yeah it was pretty amazing.
I hope to go someday.
Oh you will.
Anyways it was great talking to you.
I agree.
Let's do it again later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't wait to eat at the game.
What game are you going too see?
Green bay packers!
Packers! I don't like green bay!
You're nuts, packers are always in the lead and always look good winning losing.
Man, I'm a cowboys fan, they'de beat packers any day of the week.
Anyways, wanna go to the game with me tonight?
You wanna know what. Sure! Why not.
So did you watch the game on sunday?
Yea, the eagles beat minnosota in it bad, 7-42 score.
That was talked about all over work.
Yea, so pick me up in 5 we must head to the game.
Hey buddy, nice cowboy hat, ready to rowdy up those fans?
Nothing like pissing pissing packer fans off, pretty fun.
Oh,oh, did you here about the giants playing next month near my moms house?
Oh man, i so wanna go, giants are ok, but seeing there tense action is so cool.
Now were at the game, and so noisy, so less on the talk and more watching.
Man, the team looks great, rooting for the dallas and the packers, enemy meets enemy.
Oh, well, who ever wins. By the way I'm going to the consession stand to get some roasted nuts, want anything while I'm there?
No, just going to sit back and root for my home team. Three strikes your out at home ball game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Anither wide receiver for the Bengals. Why?
Are you talking about the dude from Washington?
Yup
Thought so. I'm still shaking my head
The Brrownies took Peppers...oh my goodness
I cannot believe it. I simply cannot believe it.
Once again the two Ohio teams mess up in the draft
Yep...don't know whether to laugh or cry
Three of the best dbs coming out of college, and they draft none of them
I knew Marvin Lewis would do something like this
We should have gotten Lattimore
My co-worker is a Browns fan. And he is hot man
I don't blame him...
Cannot get mad any more. It is what it is
I almost think they shouldn't have brought the Browns back
Or we should have gotten Pittsburgh's team.
Hahahahaha good one
I am only tellin g the truth
We can always hop for change.
That only worked for Obama man
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you remember randall cunningham?
of course. randall was that dude.
i remember when he played for the eagles. he was a beast.
i know. do you remember when he played for the vikings?
awe man. that's when he had chris carter and all carter did was catch touch downs.
yeah. remember buddy ryan said that stupid stuff about carter?
i know right.
all he did was get cut and go to the vikings catching touch downs.
i remember that year when the vikes led the league in scoring.
randall was reincarnated.
i think that was bad coaching when they played the falcons.
what you mean?
in the n f c championship game.
what?
the falcons tied it up and the vikes had maybe forty seconds left and at least a time out or two.
oh yeah, and the coach told them to take a knee and go into overtime.
i think the vikes should have at least tried to get into field goal range.
the coach was scared.
then they messed around and lost to garbage behind atlanta.
and the broncos beat the crap out of the falcons in the super bowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait until the NFL comes back.
It should be a great year with teams having so much talent.
You think the Redskins can take it this year?
I doubt it because they need a better defense.
That and a long term quarterback.
They haven't signed a contract with Cousins yet?
No. He's going to play under the franchise tag if they don't come up with an agreement by July 17th.
I don't understand why they don't just give him a long term contract already.
I think they're looking to trade him for someone else and don't want to get strapped with him long term.
He also wants a lot more money than they want to pay.
A lot more than he should get considering he has never gotten them very far.
Well they will end up paying him more if they keep the franchise tag option every year.
That's true. This year he will get 23.9 million for the franchise tag and if they did it again next year it would be 34 million.
They definitely could have offered him at least a 3 year contract for that much money.
It doesn't make a quarterback really want to play hard if they think the team isn't fully behind them either.
If they don't want to give him a good contract they should at least let him have the opportunity to play for another team.
He has improved, but I don't think he is championship material yet.
Who is their back up quarterback?
Colt McCoy
Oh that's right. Well he's pretty good as an option if the deal falls through with Cousins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the best team in the NFL?
No doubt the Cowboys!
That's just your opinion.
No, it's the truth!
No, the Eagles are the best!
Who can top Dak Prescott?
Carson Wentz can.
I don't know about that.
Sure, he had almost 4000 yards in 2016.
Yes, but Prescott got the same or more.
You have to admit they are a tight match up.
Both are superstars.
I can't wait to see them play.
Me too.
They will be both top prospects for the Super Bowl.
I love the Super Bowl.
Especially the commercials and entertainment are incredible.
I don't know any other sport with such great entertainment.
It is hard to top.
Let's go to a game together this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Atlanta Falcons will make it back to the Superbowl?
Not this year. They blew it last year.
They had the lead last year but let it go.
Didn't they lose in overtime?
Yes, the Patriots came back and beat them.
I would love to go to a Superbowl.
Tickets are nearly impossible to get.
They cost a fortune when you can find them.
Maybe someday I will see the Lombardi trophy hoisted in person.
Who is the trophy named after?
Vince Lombardi, one of the all time greats.
I knew that. I guess my mind blanked.
Where is the next Superbowl to be held?
It will be hosted at U.S. Bank stadium.
Who plays there?
That is the Vikings stadium.
I heard that is one of the loudest NFL stadium.
You bet! All those cheering fans.
It will be cold in Minnesota in February.
Heck of a place to hold the Superbowl. There might be snow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
59 days until the NFL season kicks off!  I can't wait!
I can, I'm a Cleveland Browns fan!  Our season is over before it even begins.
Ouch that does stink.  What do you think about the rookies they got.  They seem promising, no?
I don't mean to be pessimistic but the Browns never draft well.  If you are drafted by the Browns it's usually a ticket out of the league!
Talk about bad luck, let's talk about the Atlanta Falcons blowing that lead in the Superbowl.  Do you think they can overcome that?
Yikes.  They let New England score 31 unanswered points.  Not sure how any franchise moves past that.
They have a great quarterback in Matt Ryan.  Hopefully he keeps his head.
Julio Jones is an amazing receiver as well.  I thought for sure they would take down the Patriots!
Do you think Tom Brady really played with a concussion last year like his wife said he did?
I'm sure he did.  Although he is fairly protected with all the rule changes.  It's such a physical game.
Have you been following the legal troubles of Dallas's running back Zeke Elliott?
No I haven't.  What happened?  He was so fun to watch last year.
Supposedly he has some domestic violence charge against him.  It's too bad if it's true, he was great and will only get better.
I really enjoyed following Zeke and Dak's rise to the top.  They didn't do much in the playoffs though.  Same old Dallas.
How about Derek Carr's record breaking contract?
Oh my goodness 125 million dollars?!
He really came into his own last year.  And now that they have Beast Mode, maybe they will dethrown the Patriots.
Let's hope.  I have had enough of that dynasty.
Let's go out on a limb and say that we are going to see a Cleveland vs San Francisco Superbowl this year.
In your dreams.  They two worst teams in the league will not bounce back that fast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited to for NFL season to start soon?
I sure am, pre-season is just around the corner.
Your correct, pre-season games will start next month.
Who won the super bowl last season.
The Patriots won the super bowl last year against the Falcons.
Was the super bowl a good game?
The Super Bowl was a great game and possibly the greatest comback ever.
What happened in the super bowl between the Patriots and Falcons.
The Falcons dominated the first half and really stopped Brady and his offense.
How did the patriots end up winning the super bowl?
Tom Brady and company put together the greatest 4th quarter comeback of all time.
What was so awesome about the come back in the super bowl?
After scoring each touchdown, they had to make a two point conversion just to tie the game and they did.
So, the superbowl between the Falcons and Patriots went into overtime?
Yes, after they tied the game, the patriots went on to win the game in overtime.
sounds like it was a wild game!
Not only did Tom Brady coordinate one of the greatest comebacks in history, he also set records.
What record did Tom Brady set?
Tom Brady set the record with 5 super bowl wins, the most of any quaterback ever.
Wow, I hope this season is just as exciting as last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it just me or are all the classic QB's in the NFL getting old?
You mean like Eli manning, Aaron Rodgers, and Tom BRady, those types of guys?
Exactly.  It seems like those guys are living legends who are all towards the end of their careers
Yeah to some degree I agree with that, but there are younger players that will eventually be just like those classic players for Example Russell WIlson
Is it just me or are the costs to attend NFL games like rediculous ?
its crazy, between tickets, parking, food and drinks you can spend a small fortune just for a couple of hours
Its surprising that its like that given that the fan experience from home keeps improving
Right I would rather spend $500 on my theater system at home to permantenlty keep than blow it on one game
I enjoy watching the classic NFL cities the best, the ones that actually get snow
yeah like Chicago Bears, Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers....
Exactly.  Have you been to any of those stadiums?
Yes I went to a game at Soldier Field in Chicago, and I have to say it was pretty amazing.
NFL is by far my favorite of the major sports because every game is very meaningful
I totally agree, baseball for example is way too long.  you don't need to watch every game
Do you know anyone who still collects football cards
No I don't, i think thats a thing of the past but it sure was cool back in the day.
Do you think the NFL is the best right now that its ever been?
I honestly do.   There are so many living legends playing right now and the Superbowl is bigger and better than ever
last question, who is your favorite team?
THe Cleveland Browns, go Browns baby!!!!! whoooo hooooo
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best tight end is?
Of course, Rob Gronkowski.
Hard to argue with that one - 25 Touchdowns in the last 3 years.
Yeah, and he missed half of last season - he's awesome.
He reminds me a lot of Mark Bavaro.
The old Giants Tight End?
Yeah, Bavaro was the best tight end for a short time, but he kept getting injured.
True Gronk is a sure fire hall of famer if he can stay healty.
I like Travis Kelce, he's an up and coming young tight end.
He catches a lot of balls but doesn't seem to score as much as Gronk.
Yeah, look at who's throwing to him.
True, Gronk has Brady; Kelce has Alex Smith!
An underrated tight end is Greg Olsen.
He's had three straight 1,000 yard seasons and 16 touchdowns.
He is a consistent player.
I also like Jordan Reed for Washington.
He is way too injury prone for me.
How about Jimmy Graham?
Jimmy is a great tight end; who is finally learning the system in Seattle.
I thought he career was over when he blew out his knee.  But, he's come back to be one of the best again!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think NFL should have a celebration penalty?
I am not sure. I have over celebration though.
Yeah, it can be nerve racking.
I almost think it is too subjective to penalize though.
I could understand that.
I mean if they are going to penalize any, then they should just elimnate it all together.
I don't think that would ever happen.
Me either, but it would be the only way it is fair.
I think a lot of calls are subjective.
True. Some are just ridiculious.
That's why they made the challenges available.
But those don't work on flags and such.
Yeah, but it helps with some things.
It also hurts sometimes. I mean think about the give and take of the bad calls.
Yeah, it works both ways.
I just liked things back before evyer thing was reviewed.
Things did move quicker, but so much was overlooked.
You mean like bad calls.
Yes, the modern changes help make things more fair.
Maybe, but I liked it when is was more of a game than just fair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know preseason football starts in less than one month?
Yeah, I can't wait!
I'm excited for the Redskins, I think we're going to make the playoffs this year.
Well, I think they need to.
Why do you say that?
If they don't go to the playoffs, then Kirk Cousins will most likely walk, and then it's basically like they're starting over again.
Yeah, I guess you're right, but I think we have a good shot at making the playoffs this year.
Possibly, but I think in order to do that, it will be important to beat the other NFC East teams.
What do you think of our their new running back?
I like him. I think he will contribute right away and I think he has to.
Yeah, we lost two great receivers last year.
I think they tried to work on their defense though too, which is a good thing.
What do you think our record will be?
I think they will go anywhere from eight and eight to maybe ten and six.
Do you think nine wins and seven losses will get us in the playoffs?
I'm not entirely sure.
Well, let's hope for ten wins and six losses then!
As long as they stay healthy, it's not out of reach.
We should go to a game this year!
We should! Let me know what month you're thinking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, the Falcons are stacked next year.
They will be good no doubt.
I can't believe they blew the Super Bowl.
Shocked everyone.  Biggest choke of all time.
I couldn't believe it when I saw it.
You have to think they will use that as motivation next year.
Maybe.  Depends if they can bounce back.
They will.  They are simply too talented.
Their offense is crazy good.
Yep, Ryan, Freeman...
And don't forget the best player, Julio Jones.
I didn't forget him.  He's a beast.
He might be the best receiver in the league.
It's subjective, but size and speed ratio, I'd agree.
I could see him getting 20 TD's this year.
It's not far-fetched, just depends on how much they want to feed him.
I would be chucking the ball to him every play basically.
Not every play, but I get what you mean.
No, I'm serious, every play.  They can't stop him all game.
They'll just double-team the dude if they were going to do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of all the NFL teams changing cities recently?
I think it's bad for the league.
Why do you think it's bad?
It's hard to get a loyal fan base when there's a chance a team might move.
Isn't that why the St. Louis Rams moved to Los Angeles because of the fan base?
No, they moved to get a new stadium.
That's kind of a crappy reason to move a team.
It is.  Especially when St. Louis is still paying for the old stadium.
I don't understand why cities pay for stadiums.
It's to attract a team but then the team get greedy.
How do they get greedy?
These NFL teams want a new stadium every 10 or so years.
I remember when stadiums were around forever.
Those were the best stadiums they had history.
What is the oldest stadium in the NFL?
It's Lambeau Field in Green Bay.
That's a great stadium.
It's great because it has history.
Do you think the Packers will ever leave Green Bay?
No, actually the Green Bay Packers are owned by the town and the fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a football fan?
Not really, but I used to be a huge fan.
Why don't you follow it closely anymore?
I'm a Cincinnati Bengals fan.
What does that have to do with it?
I couldn't watch them lose in the first round of the playoffs every year anymore.
They used to be so bad, though!
I know. I started watching on a weekly basis in 1995 and considered myself a diehard fan until the second playoff loss to Pittsburgh.
How are they looking this year?
I don't know that much about them anymore, but I know they have offensive line issues that will make it hard to compete.
What do you think of Marvin Lewis?
He's made things much better than the 1990s but it's clear to me they won't be able to take the next step with him at the helm.
He's been there forever.
I know, he will never be fired. This is his 15th year coming up.
What do you think of Andy Dalton?
I think he's solidly a slightly above-average QB. His performance will hinge upon whether they can protect him, which is the team's main issue headed into 2017.
What about AJ Green?
AJ Green is truly great. It's been really exciting seeing the Bengals have a league-best talent, it's been really rare. With him and Geno Atkins it's been really cool to see.
Are you going to follow the Bengals in the upcoming season?
We'll see. I'm thinking about it right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your expectation for this coming NFL season?
Well I expect it to be very competitive.
Agreed, there are going to be a lot of teams that'll begin their ascent.
Yes, there are so many young teams that are going to come into their own.
I think the Titans are going to lead the pack among the teams that are going to become contenders.
Yes, Marcus Mariota is the real deal.
I expect him to become a top 3 quarterback eventually, maybe even next season.
He definitely has the skill set to become top 3.
I am calling it, Titans will win over 12 games this season.
You sure are optimistic.
Well I believe in Mariota, I also believe that the Panthers are coming back this season.
Well I think so too, I think they are geared up to do really good.
Yes, Cam has something to prove, he is going to put up some numbers.
He is a MVP, I would not doubt that.
I still think that the Patriots are the favorites to win it all though.
Well that is a popular opinion to have, they are the most consistent team in the league.
Yeah, they would be my bet at Vegas.
Won't win much money, they are odds on favorites.
Well let's hope for some compelling games and intense rivalries.
Yes, let's hope it wont be a Patriots season again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the Cleveland Browns this year?
I think they will be improved this year.
I think so too! I think their defense will be much improved.
Yah, especially since they did so well drafting some good defensive players.
I thin they will be improved offensively as well.
Well, that can't be much worse than last year.
Haha, you got that right. Maybe they will even finish with more than 4 wins this year.
We'll see. Who else do you think will be improved this year?
Well I would have to say the Cowboys will be even better again this year.
I thought for sure they would be in the Superbowl last year.
Perhaps this will be the year for that.
Especially since those good rookies from last year have a year under their belt.
I think it may help them to get a better coach soon.
Agreed, their coach is decent, but man he never wins in the playoffs.
Any idea who you think will win the Superbowl this year.
Just like every year I would have to go with the Patriots.
Until they lose Tom Brady you almost have to favor them.
For sure! He is probably the best quarterback ever.
My guess is Patriots over the Cowboys this year
That is a pretty good guess in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Kirk Cousins will sign a long term contract this year with the Redskins?
Maybe or maybe not. The Redskins should certainly pay him
The past two years Cousins has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFC
He has set all kinds of Redskins passing records
How much do you think that he will get paid if he signs?
I am sure it will be near $30 million a year
He is set to make like $27 million this year for being franchised
He is the first one to get the tender in consecutive years
It will be crazy if he gets its a third year in a row
It would be crazy
I forget, what college did he go to?
He went to Michigan State
That's right. He was a rookie the same year as RG3
Griffin was drafted with the second pick overall. Cousins was drafted in the fourth round
It was certainly a wise fourth round pick looking back on it.
Yes. Cousins took over for Griffin numerous times especially that first season
When did Cousins make his first start for the Redskins?
That first year against the Browns. RG3 missed that one game after injuring his knee the first time.
What game did RG3 hurt his knee against for Cousins to start the next week.
Ravens. Haloti Ngata hit him. Cousins came in that game and brought the team back to win against the Ravens. He started and won that next week against the Browns.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about who you think will win each AFC division.  Let's start with the AFC East.
The New England Patriots - hands down.
I agree with you on that.  Miami will be improved, but they still can't touch the Patriots.
How about the AFC North?
That's going to be a tough division. for sure the Browns won't win it.  They are really bad again.
I agree with that statement.  i think this divisions is going to be one of the toughest in the league.
Yeah, it looks like a three team race between the Ravens, Bengals, and Steelers.
I think the Ravens will take it.  they picked up Maclin and have a stellar defense, and Flacco has been in big games before.
Speaking of big game players, Roethlisberger's been there too.  They have Bell and Brown, I'm going with the Steelers.
On to the AFC West. Another tough division.
I really think the Raiders are going to be tough.  They picked up Lynch.
For me, it's a toss up between Denver and Kansas City.
Denver's quarterback is really suspect.
I agree with that, I would pick Kansas City to win it.
KC has a great defense and Smith is a decent QB.
How About the AFC South?
This one is easy for me.  I like Houston's defense, so I'm going Houston.
Houston has a great defense, but their QB is suspect.
Who do you think then?
I'm picking Tennessee. I think Mariotta surprises people and they win the division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you excited for this years football season?
Yes im very excited !  How about you?
Im very excited as well did you hear ?
Hear about what ?
That the super bowl this year will be held in minnesota
I had no idea that's so exciting !
Question we both live in minnesota we should consider buying tickets this year
I will be up for that we should start looking for tickets
I agree lets start looking now so that we can find a good deal
Ok i agree
So who do you think will win this years superbowl ?
I hope the vikings do this year how about you ?
We are both rooting for the same team i also want the vikings to win it !
They will for sure!
Not for sure we gotta worry about new england !
Thats true but we can stop them this year for sure
Lets hope so !
Well it was nice talking lets keep in touch on those tickets
i agree
okay cya later
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Dwayne Allen will have a shot in New England?
I don't know, he did not do that well before.
True, but that was in Indianapolis.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Brian Dawkins should be in the hall of fame?
Yes that is someone who deserves it.
Why do you think he hasnt been inducted?
The writers for some reason do not like safeties
Why?
They just seem them as not elite cornerbacks who just have to tackle.
I mean thats just the position of a lineman if you think about it.
Well they have to rush the QB.
But we are in a passing league, all 4 secondary positions are important.
Yeah I think thats the truth for the most part.
So why no love for safeties?
There hasnt been a whole lot of great ones.
I like Polamalu will get in to and Ed Reed
Yeah they will have a decision to come to soon
I just dont see how Dawkins dominance doesnt get him in first time.
He played in an era with great safeties
He just had all the requisite skills for his position as well
He was a team leader
He was more than just that too
Yeah fans still wear his jersey proudly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, what's up?
Not much, can't wait for NFL this year.
Yeah me too. You're a Patriots fan, right?
Yes sir, we NFL champions!
Yeah, that was a pretty amazing Superbowl. What do you say to everyone that says Patriots are cheaters?
Haha, well they were not cheating in the Superbowl!
I am talking about the deflategate situation.
That was totally fake. There wasn't any evidence of that.
Honestly, I don't know what happened there. They were accused of deflating balls or something during important games?
Something like that. But they denied the accusations. There was an investigation and everything.
I don't think the investigation was very public.
No it wasn't. How do you substantiate those claims?
Well if there are accusations of something that crazy, you can't think they just came out of thin air can you?
I think that given the Patriots success, it is not unbelievable that others are jealous.
Haha whatever, I just know a lot of my friends think they are cheaters.
Let's assume they cheated. You can't deny Tom Brady and Bob Belichick's pure skill.
That I will agree with. But if they cheated their accomplishments are tainted, in my opinion.
I don't think so. I think they are the greatest NFL pair of all time.
We will see if they win any more championships.
I can assure you, they will, man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, they may be going down this year.
Yea, just like the Giants.
Yea, the Giants haven't made a lot of noise lately.
Well, Odell Beckham has, but its been mostly crying.
Yea, great receiver, but he needs to keep his mouth shut.
Yea, man if that guy puts it together, he's a stud.
Yea, he already is a great player, but his act is annoying.
Yea, well Eli isn't exactly getting any younger either. Their window of opportunity is closing.
Yea, and they haven't done much to improve their team.
I agree. They do have a ton of holes.
Yea, well that division may be up for grabs.
We know the redskins won't do too much.
The cowboys could repeat if they could keep their team out of prison.
Yea, they have a good young team and should stay solid this year.
Yea, the quarterback really looked like the real deal.
True, but anybody would behind that offensive line.
I agree. That might be one of the best offensive lines ever.
Yea, that and Elliot make them a real contender.
Yea, they do have some star power.
I agree! Throw Dez into the mix too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Colin Kaepernick?
The guy that plays football?
Yeah, him.
No, not really.
Really?  I think he was awesome with the 49ers.
Oh, he was a good quarterback.
But you don't like him?
I don't really like his politics I guess.
What do you mean?
I don't really have anything against him, I just believe that a lot of his beliefs are wrong.
Oh, like not standing for the national anthem?
Yeah, that stuff.
He has the right to feel how he feels though.
I understand that, but at the same time I have the right to disagree.
I hear you.
And I'm not sure if he chose the correct platform.
How do you mean?
He could have started foundations that fostered what he believed in. He didn't have to use the NFL as a voice.
It was an easy way to reach a lot of people.
He reached a lot of people that didn't want to hear it though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A lot of coaches in the NFL seem to have a cult of personality
Absolutely. Mike Ditka was a good coach but also fun to watch.
I think people feel the same way about Sean Payton
The Saints coach?
Yes. He wrote a book
Yeah, but he still seems kind of boring.
True. White bread for sure.
It seems like the NFL has a minority coaching problem
Yeah there aren't too many nonwhite coaches.
Ron Rivera, for the Panthers.
I think the Chargers have Anthony Lynn
Yeah, and I think there a handful more
What do you think they should do to fix it?
I guess just try harder to encourage and support minority coaches.
They should get more female referees and coaches as well
For sure. Women know just as much about the game these days
They even play it now.
Kathryn Smith works for the Bills as a coach
Oh right I forgot about her.
And the Cardinals had Jennifer Welter
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder who had the most punt return TDs last year...
Well. Things like punt return TDs are better if we look at the career records
How come?
Because it's a rare thing. We don't get it in every game, Some teams never even get one ina season.
Huh. That's a good piont. So who has the most punt return TD over the career?
Devin Hester who had 14 punt return TDs over between 2006-2016
That's amazing
in 2007, he had 4 punt return TDs. That's like every third week.
That must have been amazing to watch
Yep, excepot he hasn't had one since 2014. See these are so rare, it's kinda pointless to talk about a season record.
I see your point. But season records are what we use to fantasy mostly.
Um, some people use average of the seasons for fantasy. Others even use bayesian networks. But football isn't very amenable for bayesian if you ask me
How's that?
We need way more data points, more than they keep.
How many more pata points?
For Baeysian predictions to be reliable? probably millions
We probably have millions of data points for NFL.
Yeah, but we need the right kind of data at those numbers. And we don't.
Even NFL doesn't give you enough data points? That's insane.
Well, it's just reality. It's just like financial market prediction. The agents are stochastic, and they often defy predictions
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why is nobody talking up the Ravens right now?
What do you mean exactly?
It just seems like nobody is giving them much of a shot this year.
The Ravens are just an okay team, that's why.
But they've got some good players.
Aging players maybe.  Some of their better guys are past their prime.
I think Joe Flacco is still a top five QB.
There's a lot wrong with that statement.  He's not even top ten.
But he won a Super Bowl.
Yeah, five years ago.  League has changed since then.
Just saying that you're sleeping on his potential.
Nope, they overpaid him and he's never produced that well again.
Well, they'll be better than you think.
Not with that aging defense.
What are you talking about.
Weddle, Suggs, old, old, old.
They're crafty veterans.  Those guys make the team better.
They don't have the defense they used to.
Sure, not unless you're bringing back Ray Lewis.
I don't have a time machine to do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey mom, were we still having to go to Philadelphia this winter?
We have to in order to see your uncle.
I know, I just wanted to see if we could make a slight detour.
It really depends, what did you want to do?
I wanted to visit the Lincoln Financial Field.
Is that for Baseball for something?
No it is for the Eagles Football team.
Oh that sounds very cool, I honestly don't see why not.
Thank you mom, my favorite player of all time was on that team.
Which player was that?
I loved the quarterback Donvan McNabb.
Oh I remember you having his jersey.
Yeah I wore it all the time!
Does he still play?
Not anymore, he was big over 10 years ago when I was finishing high school.
I may want to check out a game there since we won' visit again for a long time.
I would love to watch a game, it would honor the best QB of all time.
I will check for tickets.
Thanks mom I love you.
I love you too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's going on Brian? Aren't you a Raiders fan?
You better believe it! Raider Nation!
You think they can make a run with the new quarterback?
Man our defense is scary, I don't care about offense.
Really? You guys have some pretty good weapons in your receivers and running backs man.
Listen, I'm in it for the hitting bro, not the flash f touchdowns.
But you can score on defense and most times it's flashier than an offensive score,
Ha, because it's such a magnificent play to strip your opponent of his goal and run it in their faces.
Your clearly biased towards them, I don't know why I even brought up the Raiders.
A lot of hostility in that tone Eagles fan.
Ha, whatever bro, you want to go to the game this weekend?
I'm not sure man, it's not a good time for me to buy any tickets.
I didn't ask that bro, I asked if you wanted to see your bum Raiders get whooped?
Ha ha, more hostility I see. Let's see if those bum eagles can match your enthusiasm.
Ha ha, whatever man. My former teammates gave me some cool tickets and I knew you were a bums fan.
Really? On who's team?
Your bum Raiders but you don't pay attention to offense.
I know my team man, what's there names? I know every Raider I'm sure of it.
Ha, we'll see when you meet them. Don't get all star struck and pee your pants asking for an autograph.
Wait, so I HAVE to know him right? I know every Raider man come on!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Chicago Bears?
They aren't the worst team.
Who is your favorite player on their roster?
Kendall Wright has some promise.
His stats haven't been to great the past two seasons.
He is really fast though.
I'm sure he could surprise anyone and have a good season.
Part of it is luck.
You think he has been unlucky so far?
Yeah exactly what I think.
What do you think he needs to do to improve?
Well beyond putting more work in the offseason he should not overthink his stats.
Yeah overthinking anything never ends well.
If he can just tune out all the noise and focus on the game he has a chance to be great.
I would love to see him have a great season.
Also seeing the Bears have a great season would be nice.
Yeah just making the playoffs would be great.
They haven't made an appearance since 2010.
They definitely want to end that drought.
I agree it would be nice for them to make the playoffs this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to be hosting NFL Sunday parties again this year ?
Yes I will, every Sunday.
I will be there every week, just like last year.
That's good. Are you going to wear your Browns jersey again.
Of course I will, that's my team.
How many games did they win last year?
They won only once in the entire last year.
What team did they beat?
They beat the Chargers, on the day that I didn't wear my jersey.
I thought so, maybe this year you should try not wearing your jersey.
That's not a bad idea, any help with luck would be good.
It's going to take more than just luck for the Browns to do good this year.
I was born in Cleveland and there are a lot of us die hard Browns fans.
I know, how many times have the Browns won the Super Bowl?
They have never been to the Super Bowl, but you already knew that didn't you.
Yes I knew, there are four teams that have never been to the Super Bowl.
The Browns have won an NFL championship game though, before the creation of the Super Bowl.
The Detroit Lions have also done that, and they have never been to a Super Bowl either.
This is the year the Browns finally make it to the Super Bowl.
I'll believe it when I see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the better Packers Quarterback Brett Favre or Aaron Rogers.
I'd take Favre for the longevity and being an Iron Man.
He was a great quarterback but he had his weaknesses.
He was prone to throw many interceptions.
But he always made the game interesting.
And he does have Super Bowl victories.
I personally think Rogers is a better quarterback.
His accuracy is deadly and he has mobility too.
I think I would take Rogers if they both played at the same time.
Farve is the Iron Man but Rogers in just unstoppable.
Having Rogers on the team turns that team into a different team.
When he gets hurt they usually miss the playoffs.
But when he is in they always go.
They need to get him more help on defense.
Yes, with defense this becomes a Super Bowl team.
But they are always in it as long as they have Rogers.
Yes, Rogers alone keeps them very competitive and in the playoffs.
Unfortunately they often have bad defenses.
Yes it just hasn't been a priority.
Well teams do what they can with the salary cap and Rogers demands the big bucks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So big question, who is your favorite NFL team?
I guess I'd have to go with the Dallas Cowboys.
Really? You live in Pennsylvania?
I know, and believe me my neighbors aren't happy about it!
Do they give you flack on game days?
More than just game days! And sometimes it gets really heated!
I can only imagine.
Trust me you have no idea!
Do you have a favorite player?
I'm gonna go with Troy Aikman on that one.
He was a quarter back right?
Yep, and he got us three Superbowl rings!
Awesome. Didn't he also play with Emmit Smith and Michael Irvin?
Absolutely, and having receivers like them makes it easier on a quarterback.
Well yeah I guess so.
The 90'2 were good to the cowboys.
And don't forget about the cheerleaders.
Best looking group out there.
And talented.
Makes a good game even better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this year?
Gotta go with the Falcons!
Really?
Hey, they nearly won the Superbowl last year.
True, but a lot of the teams who make the Superbowl but lose end up having a bad year the next year.
Is that true?
Anecdotally, it feels true.
Hmm, I'd be interested in seeing the data on that.
Yeah, I'm looking here, and a surprisingly large number of Superbowl losers don't even make the playoffs the next year.
Yikes, guess maybe my Falcons pick is risky!
They seem like they'll be good next year, though.
I definitely believe that. Their offense is so versatile.
Matt Ryan makes all the right decisions.
For sure. And Julio Jones is a beast of a wide receiver.
The catch he made in the Superbowl was superhuman.
I can't believe a human is capable of doing some of the stuff he does.
Definitely one of the players worth watching a game for.
I do kind of worry about the defense, though.
They had a nice year last year.
True, but it's easy with that offense running the way it did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
New Orleans Saints.
Yes, the unofficial rivals of the Bucs.
Yes. Did you know that this season is the last season of Drew Brees' contract?
No, i did'nt know that.
Well, it is. It made me wonder.
Wonder what?
Are they going to fight harder if it is Drew's lasy year?
An intreguing thought.
We have to play the saints twice this season.
Yes, that's what made me wonder. Is it going to be harder if they want to have a killer year.
Well, obviously so. The other question would be is how much life does Drew have left in him.
Or can the team carry him thru to the playoffs.
He could also be planning just renewing his contract and it will be business as usual.
That's a possibility as well.
I'll probably be watching the Saints in Pre-Season to see how they play.
That's a good idea, i will as well.
They have to face the Vikings and Patriots right out of the gate.
Thry also play us and the Falcons twice this season.
Interesting, i see a pattern where there is not a lot of mix in division playing this year.
Not with the Saints and Bucs it seems
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
Seriously dude, I am still cleaning up fireworks from the fourth of July.
That means were more than halfway from the end of last season to the beginning of next. I cannot wait.
How far away is the season?
Just a mere two months before we have weekly television broadcasts for seventeen glorious weeks.
Who is your favorite team again?
Surely you jest. The Pittsburgh Steelers of course!  What other teams are there?
Ah, the New England Patriots, the Dallas Cowboys, the Green Bay Packers, the San Francisco....
I know, I know. I know there are other teams, of course, I am just saying the Steelers are my favorite.
Are they playing any really good teams this year?
They play the Packers in a Sunday night game.
Who else?
Well, the big game is in December. They are at home against none other than Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.
Mark that down as a loss.
What are you talking about?  No way the Steelers lose that game.
No way? The Steelers never beat the Patriots.
That's just not true.  I admit they haven't beaten them lately; but the series is actually tied 15-15.
You mean the Steelers and the Patriots have played thirty times and neither team has a winning record?
That's absolutely correct.  They have each won fifteen out of thirty games.
I never would have thought that; I thought the Patriots beat everybody all the time. Live and learn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is one of the highest paid players in the NFL?
One of the highest paid players is Andrew Luck
Who does he play for ?
He plays for the Indianapolis Colts
Who owns that team ?
The owner is Jim Irsay
What position does Andrew Luck play ?
He is the quarterback
What is he being paid.
About a year ago he was given a six year contract for $140 million dollars.
Wow is that the highest now?
No, other players have surpassed it.
Who has surpassed that contract.
Another quarterback Derek Carr
Who does he play for?
Derek Car plays for the Oakland Raiders
What is he being paid?
He got a contract for $125 million dollars.
For how long is that contract?
That is for a five year contract
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the nfl
Sounds great
Do you like the 49ers
They are okay
They are my favorite team
Mine is dallas cowboys
They play the cowboys october 22nd
That should be a good game
I agree
What time do they play
3:05 central time
Oh good
I like afternoon games
Me too
If theyre on too late i fall asleep
Same here
Im looking forward to the 49ers and panthers game
The panthers are a great team
Yes its the first gsme of the season
Thats cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe the Patriots won another Superbowl
I know- I'm so tired of them. I'm not a big fan of sports dynasties.
Do you think Tom Brady is too old to be an elite quarterback?
If it was anyone else, I would say yes. But Tom Brady is super human.
Agreed. Though I really don't like him or Belichek
Yea, I like the underdog- I wish Matt Ryan won.
Matt Ryan is a really under-rated quarterback. I think he will be good in the years to come.
What about Tony Romo? Do you think he still has a chance in the NFL?
He may, if his age and injuries don't get in the way.
A lot of people outside of Dallas don't like him, but his stats don't lie. He is an elite quarterback as well
Agreed- he was- but I think he is too old. What team would pick him up?
Maybe a team that has a young quaterback draft pick that needs a veteran presence for a couple years?
Yea that could be a lot of teams this upcoming year.
I think it would be weird to see Tony Romo in another jersey besides the Cowboys though!
Thats true- I felt the same way when McNabb left the eagles for the redskins- so weird
Or how about when Bret Farve left Green Bay for Minnosota?
Oh yea- that was weird too.
Did you hear about that Oakland Raiders QB that is trying for a comeback at 48?
48? That is WAY to old to play professional football.
Agreed
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow the Hokies that play in the NFL?
Absolutely! I love the success Tyrod Taylor is having with Buffalo.
He's such a great kid. Any others?
Sure, the Fuller brothers are exceptional.
I knew Kendall Fuller signed with the Redskins.
Right, and Corey is with New Orleans.  Kyle went with Chicago.
What a family! The other legacy family didn't do as well.
You must be talking about Michael and Marcus Vick.
What losers.  Michael, so talented and then got caught up in that dog fighting thing.
I know, right?  Michael was horrible and Marcus was a criminal. Could have been so different.
Did you know Sam Rogers is with the LA Rams?  The kid walked on for Beamer.
Amazing. I love a good walk on story.
Who else?
I should have mentioned that two other Hokies, besides Tyrod, play for Buffalo.
Really, who?
Logan Thomas plays tight end.
And who else?
Nigel Williams plays defensive end.
Once a Hokie, always a Hokie!
Even in the NFL. Glad you kept track of these players. I'll pay more attention to Buffalo this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the top players in the NFL are right now?
That's a good question, players are so crazy right now.
I know, but if you had to choose, who would be your top players?
Well, definitely Tom Brady.
Yea Tom is a beast, he has to be in the list.
Yea, the patriots would be nothing without him.
I don't know about that, but he's a great pick.
Next would be Antonio Brown.
What position does he play again?
Wide receiver.
Oh right for the steelers.
Yea, he's amazing.
Ok, who else?
Cam Newton
The Panthers QB?
Yea, he's up there.
I guess he's pretty good. I'm just not a Panther's fan.
Well you didn't ask what teams I liked, you asked who the best players were.
Yea true, I just find it hard to think someone is good when they are on a team I hate.
Well, that's just narrow minded.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Did you watch the Super Bowl?
I sure did. How does Atlanta blow a 28-3 lead?
They stopped running the ball. That and nobody is better than Tom Brady.
Yeah, I guess. I was so mad because I hate the Patriots.
Well this has been a tough decade for you. The Patriots have been so good and many experts think they will repeat this year.
Oh that's great. My Dolphins hopefully will be good enough to get to the playoffs and stop them.
I wouldn't count on it. You guys need a better quarterback. Tanned ill is okay, but he isn't a Super Bowl winner.
I think you are wrong about that. Sure he isn't Tom Brady or Russel Wilson, but he is good and can effectively manage a game. If you build a solid team you don't need to have an all star quarterback.
I understand that. Look at New England, Tom Brady turns scrubs into all stars. I just think Tannehill isn't effective enough to get it done.
Well, Tannehill has greatly improved every year in the league. Dolphins finally got to the playoffs last year. I have hope for him and this team.
Yeah, I guess it could be worse. You could be the Jaguars. If not the Patriots, who do you think can win it all this year?
I still think Atlanta has a great team. Matt Ryan is so consistent. They just have to keep giving the ball to Devonta Freeman. He can be a receiver to if they'd throw it to him.
Yeah, I definitely don't think Atlanta was a fluke last year. But, I think Carolina is going to take that division. They had a fluke season last year.
I think Carolina's fluke season was the one where they were actually good. I think the bad years are more Carolina's true nature.
No way. The earlier years Carolina had no talent around Cam Newton. And last year Cam was hurt. So I think the good year was more representative.
We will agree to disagree on that. Can we agree that Buccaneers fans are getting out of control with their trash talking and about how good they think they are now?
Yeah, there's best in the division isn't that good. There's no way they get by both Atlanta and Carolina this year. They do have some talent though.
I agree with that. But not enough talent to be a serious contender.
Dolphins are going to win the Super Bowl anyway, right?now that
I sure do hope so. I can't take another season of New England.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the greatest running back in Raiders history is?
I think it was Bo Jackson.
Really, I look at him as a one hit wonder.
He had great break out speed.
He did, but he wasn't fully committed to football, which hurt him.
He was still the greatest.
After he got hurt, it was all over.
Who do you think is the greatest?
Marcus Allen, no question.
Al Davis had a personal vendetta against Allen.
That's what they say.  Al claims there were just better players.
Allen was the greatest back who led them to a Super Bowl.
It's a shame what Al Davis did.
Yes.  I couldn't understand why he would not play him.
It was stupid.
He was hurting the team for personal reasons
He should have just let him go if he wasn't going to play him.
He finally got released to play a good season in Kansas City.
Well, he still made the Hall of Fame and had a great career.
For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about football.
Okay.
What team do you like best?
I like the Steelers a lot.
Okay that sounds pretty cool.
Yeah I love Ethan Cooper as a player.
He is pretty great.
Have you seen them yet in person?
I did go to one game.
Was it amazing?
Yeah it definitely was.
Brandon Dixon is a good player as well.
I definitely agree.
Do you like them more than the Patriots?
For sure.
They are kind of underrated though.
Which team?
The Steelers.
That is for sure.
Anyways it was great talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Cowboys will do this year?
Will be tough to repeat last year I reckon.
Yeah, schedule is much harder.
That in itself will probably get them a few more losses.
I think they will still probably go 10-6.
Really?  That seems high to me.
I don't think so.  Why do you say that?
Well, the rest of the division all got better.
Philly maybe, Washington and the Giants will be the same.
Nah, I think they all made improvements.
But Dak will have another year as a starter.
Defenses will key on him more.
But he's experienced now and will adapt to the game.
They will still blitz him all the time.
That didn't rile him last year.
But that was last year.  Again, lots more tape to look at.
Well, the Cowboys will only get as far as he takes them.
Yep, QB play means everything.
I expect him to make the Pro Bowl again.
Competition is tough, so we'll see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who you rooting for this year?
Let's see.  The Redskins.  The Jets.
Haha!  That will do no good to root for them.
I like the underdog.
Then, you're going for the right teams.
I can't stand the Patriots.  Cheaters.  I'm not rooting for them.
Even though you'll end up with a Super Bowl?
Yes.  I'm not a fair weathered fan.
Well, keep on rooting for the Jets.  You'll be a fan allright, just no wins.
I know.  Maybe I'll start following Pittsburgh.
With Roethlisberger?  No way.
I know, but they've created a dynasty and I think he's matured a lot.
Maybe.  They're a better choice than your others.
I'm hoping they'll actually utilize their draft picks.
Maybe.  What about Cleveland?
No way.  They can't pick a good player at all.
Haha!  You're right.  Better stick with Pittsburgh.
Yep.  I do like Bell.
He's paid way too much.  Choose someone else!
I'll have to think about that.  Everyone's paid too much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Packers secondary?
Well, its weird. I think they have good players and talent, but they dont seem to produce.
Do you think that's Dom Capers fault?
I dont know. But when you look at the roster, they should be better. Haha Clinton Dix and Burnett are solid safeties. And Demarious Randall has talent.
Yeah but in today's NFL, corners are sooo important.
Yeah, and I think the Sam Shields injury really hurt the Packers secondary last year.
Yeah you may have a point there. In the playoff game they had Gunter covering Julio Jones.
Exactly. You can't expect much success in that situation.
And Gunter was probably the best corner on the Packers last year. But on most teams, and in the Packers ideal world, he would be a nickel back.
Yup. I think that shows how damaging the injury bug is.
In today's NFL secondary. Depth is key.
For sure, these days you need three or four good corners to cover whatever the NFL throws at you.
Yeah the base defense has become the nickel. You need three corners on the field all day, and if you have injury problems, pretty soon you're going to have some bad players out there.
I think this is precisely what happened to the Packers defense last year.
Well, they did add a few corners in the draft I believe.
Yeah they took Washington's Kevin King early in the second round.
Yeah, I'm excited to see him play. He looks very talented.
Yeah, scouts said he was a first round talent.
I read he has freakish athletic ability, is that true?
I haven't seen him play before but I heard his arms are crazy long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite NFL team?
The Washington Redskins.  Who is yours?
I love the Dallas Cowboys.  I think we're in this season!
The Super Bowl?  I doubt that.
Are you serious!? Did you not see that performace last season by Dak and Zeke?
Yeah, they are good.  But, as usualy with the Cowboys, not good enough to get to the big game.
We beat you guys. Twice, if I'm not mistaken...
But, we had a disconnected team.  I don't think that will happen this season.  Cousins is good and they've beefed up our other areas.
You guys need to get rid of a few people, too. Eitherway, we will do the same thing we did last year with you guys. Win!
I doubt that.  Dak and your RB were new and there was no film on them.  Now, everybody has something to study and find out their quirks...
OMG! I can't believe you think that with the kind of skill and talent they have, that tape on them is going to make that big of a difference.  They were rookies and still went almost undefeated!
Tape is a very useful tool and those guys study that stuff hard before playing a team.  You guys will not have a year like you had last year.
You wish.  There has been tape on Brady for years.  He's still, although I hate to admit it, one of the greats.  I'm not saying that having the tape is not helpful.  But, when it is true talent, it won't change the outcome.
I don't know about that.... Man, what do you have against Tom Brady!? Even I say he is the man!
He seems like an awful person to me.  I just don't like him.  Also, he's a cheater.  His whole team has been caught several times now doing things that are against the rules in football.
He was out for 4 games last year and they still made it to the big game!
He's an excellent cheater.  I just think that run was fueled by anger. LOL!
You would say that.... One second you say that talent or skill can overcome anything like, for instance, tapes.  Then you say cheating is the reason a very talented QB with 4 rings has them.
Lets not get side-tracked...  The Cowboys will win the Super Bowl this year.  Brady is on the downslope and it's our time now after 20 years!
You Cowboys fans say that every year...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Jarvis Landry?
No what happened to him?
He has hopes to land a new deal with the Miami Dolphins soon.
So what is the problem?
He doesn't want to be engaged in contract negotiations once the season starts.
What? Thats silly. Why would he say that?
He says he wants to focus completely on the game and not have to multi task.
I can understand that to a degree but I still think it's a bad idea.
I hope he makes a good deal with the team.
Why do you say that?
Well he's one of ths most underpaid players in the league?
Underpaid? How much is he making?
He's making $900,000.
Thats underpaid!?
Well compared to others in his position.
There has to be some reason for the low pay. Is he a bad player?
No. Actually the very opposite.
Oh so he is basically asking for a raise.
Yeah actually you could say that.
I'm sure he will get some kind of increase in pay but just under a million a year is good in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Yes i enjoy watching football very nuch
Me too
I love the patriots
They are a good team
I think they can go all the way
Definitely
They have great players on their team
And they are so talented
Absolutely
Who else do you think will be in the superbowl
Panthers
They have been playing pretty good lately
They have
That would be a great superbowl to see
Awesome matchup
Exactly
Thanks for chatting with me
Anytime
Bye
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Concussion?
No I haven't.
It stars Will smith and it's about the NFL.
Oh cool. Is Will smith a football player?
No actually he's an African doctor.
Interesting. Can you give me a rundown of the plot?
Are you planning on watching the movie?
Probably not.
Okay. This movie actually got a lot of anti-press from the NFL because it's an anti football movie.
Wow. That's crazy.
Yeah. Will smith is a doctor that tries to expose to the world the major head injuries caused by football.
That's a pretty heavy movie, typical of Will Smith.
It follows a lot of true story NFL players that had mental problems or even ones who died from their head injuries.
So that's why the movie's called concussion.
Precisely. I highly reccommend it.
Awesome. I'll have to check it out.
Yeah I think it scored like 90% on rotten tomatoes, and I know you care about high ratings.
I just hope I don't stop watching football after watching concussion.
Me too, and I haven't even watched the movie yet.
Me too, and I haven't even watched the movie yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for football season?
Man, I can't wait. Ready to see these Bills get it going.
Hopefully, they got a good reboot in during the offseason.
Hopefully. I'm glad Rex Ryan is gone.
Me too. You know how much I hate him.
He is the worst. All he thinks about are the Pats.
Yeah, right? Like, dude, focus on your OWN team.
And his brother's defense was, of course, trash.
Certified trash. How many games did they lose?
I think at least 9.
It's a shame. Tyrod Taylor looks like he has some potential.
I know, right? It's criminal!
And then, of course, y'all have Watkins and McCoy.
Is McCoy still there?
I think so, but maybe not. But still... Watkins and Taylor.
Yeah, that's a deadly duo.
But Watkins needs to stay healthy.
Heck, so does Tyrod.
That's true too.
Yeah, but I think they can make the playoffs this year, for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm ready for this season!
Who's your favorite team?
I'm a Giants man all the way!
Me too! I love the G-men!
I think they win the division this year.
Even over Dallas?
I think Dallas was a fluke last year.
I agree.
Plus Odell Beckham is on a mission.
He's the best receiver in football.
I think he's the best in Giant's history too.
Who are some of your favorite players from the past?
I like Phil Simms.
What about Harry Carson?
He was good, but you know who the man then was.
Oh yes, Lawrence Taylor was unreal.
That's because he was on cocaine.
Haha, I saw his kill Eric Hipple once.
That guy was never the same.
Few were after LT hit them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you want to see out of the NFL in 2017?
I would like to see another amazing playoff run.
Like the Patriots last year?
Well, they did well, but also similar to what the Falcons did.
Are you a Matt Ryan fan?
Yes, I think he is one of the best quarterbacks in the league.
I almost feel like he is underrated now.
This is probably true, especially living in Tom's shadow.
Everybody lives in his shadow, unfortunately.
I think that Aaron Rogers is the only one who might not.
But even Aaron only has one title.
Watch out for Green Bay this year - they are going to be mean.
Of course, but Jordy Nelson has to stay healthy.
This is true - but he had a phenomenal year last year.
Yes, he's been amazing every year he's stayed healthy.
He's one of the fastest players in the league, that's for sure.
Yes he is, and definitely faster than he looks.
Is that because he is white?
I guess so - but the man can hustle, that's for sure.
All cornerbacks seem to have a problem with him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really, really like Marshawn Lynch.
Me too, what is it that you like about him?
Mostly I like his attitude and ability on the football field.
I agree because he seems to let his play do the talking.
He definitely does, even during the Superbowl media coverage he would hardly say anything.
Honestly, I would prefer to hear what he thinks more often.
I'll be happy to see him play again.  Did you hear he's playing for the Oakland Raiders this year?
I did hear that and I'm quite excited about it.
As a Seattle Seahawks fan I really wish he was still with my team.
Yeah, it's kind of sad the way that second Superbowl ended.
I think he definitely deserved that second victory and I'm mostly just disappointed at the play calling there.
I'm sure most people were.
The worst part of it is, even though so many people agree that play calling was terrible, that guy is still with the Seahawks.
At least we'll probably get to see Marshawn Lynch run the football in this upcoming season.
The Raiders made the playoffs last year so maybe having him will make them a real competitor.
You never know, sometimes football seems like pure chance with the injuries and all.
Speaking of injuries, that's another thing I really love about Marshawn Lynch.
What's that?
It just seems that he's a super tough guy and is very durable.
You definitely need durability to be an NFL running back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite NFL team?
I like The Denver Broncos.
Cool. I bet you were excited when they won Super Bowl 50.
It was awesome seeing them win their third Super Bowl.
It was also sentimental since it was Peyton Manning's last game.
Peyton Manning is one of the greatest quaterbacks and I'm glad he got to play for The Broncos.
It's not hard to argue that Peyton's a great player. So is his brother Eli.
Eli still plays for The New York Giants, right?
Yes, he's been with them since 2004.
How many Super Bowls did Eli play in?
He played in two Super Bowls. Both times The Giants beat The Patriots.
Wow! That's amazing that they beat The Patriots.
It is, considering The Patriots are one of the top teams in the NFL.
With 5 Super Bowl wins, how can you not say The Patriots are a good team.
A lot of their success is due to their coach Bill Belichick.
That's true. He's been coaching since 1979 and worked with various teams.
Really? What other teams did he coach for?
He worked with The New York Giants early in his career.
I never knew he was a coach for The Giants.
He was with them for 11 years before he became coach for The Cleveland Browns.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you take if you could decide again: Rivers, Eli or Big Ben.
I think Rivers. But it's close between him and Eli.
No love for Ben?
He's great but gets hurt too much.
Injury prone, yeah.
Not prone just a factor of his play.
Eli hasn't missed a start though.
True.
And has two rings.
Also true, but I think Rivers is just the best of the three.
Shame he doesn't have a ring.
Yeah, I guess he just hasn't had the team around him.
I mean, he had LT and Gates for years.
That's true.
And he's had pretty good defenses.
Also true.
And a favorable division.
Yeah but you know who screwed it all up?
Who?
Norv Turner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Titans pick up any WRs? They sorely needed some
Mariota is useless withotu anyone to throw the ball to.
Seriously Titans have the worst receiving crew if you ask me.
Yep. They're pretty bad. They picked up that WR from WMU, what's his name?
Oh, Corey Davis!, he was a beast at WMU.
NCAA FBA Division I Career receiving leader. 5278 yards
Of all time?
Of ALL time, going back to whenever they started tracking it.
Dude was a beast at WMU, but he was realy the only WR they had so they had to use him.
Well they had other options, but none were as good as Davis.
i wonder how well he will do with Mariota
Well, at least he will be able to catch his ball unliek Titan's current WRs.
I heard Davis scored 31 on Wonderlic test.
Yep, That's pretty high for a WR. They usually range 17 or so
Yeah, usually QBs have high Wonderlic scores.
The lowest score ever in the NFL was Morris Claireborne who got a 4.
Janitors score 14...
Yep. We're talking borderline retarded. 10 is the cut off for being literate, I think.
Haha, good thing he's good at football.
Probably won't be able to do much else.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think this is the year the Raiders finally go deep in the playoffs.
Are you serious?
I am serious.  I think that Carr is good and so is their defense.
Well they did have a good season last year.
I think they are the trendy pick goign into the season.
Whatever happened with them moving to Las Vegas?
I'm not sure if it got approved.
It would be weird to see them in Vegas.
Well they did move a few times already.
That is true. The were in Los Angeles at one point.
Who is your pick to win it all?
That's a tough call but I'm going to say the Cowboys.
They sure looked great last year except for their defense is lacking.
I think they drafter some good rookies that can fill in right away.
Well drafting is smart because those players are cheaper then free agents.
The Cowboys like to pay big money to free agents, but I think they are changing that philosophy.
It would be wise for them to do so.
I agree building from within like the Patriots can lead to sustained success.
They are the NFL blue print that every team should follow.
Having Tom Brady isn't hurting them either!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the worst play in NFL history?
The worst play?
Yeah, the worst play!
I know what was the best play, but I don't know about the worst.
Ok. What was the best play?
The Immaculate Reception.
Th immaculate what?
The Immaculate Reception, which is one of the most famous plays in the history of NFL football. It happened during the 1972 AFC divisional playoff game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Oakland Raiders
Did that involve Mean Joe Green?
This was the play where Terry Bradshaw, with only seconds left in the game and down by less than seven points, threw a bomb to John Fuqua.
Last minute plays happens all the time.
Not like this!  The intended receiver missed the ball, and it bounced off the defensive guy, only to be scooped up by the Stealer's fullback, Franco Harris, just before the ball hit the turf.
Really?
Yeah!  And with only seconds remaining in the game, Harris takes this gift--this ball that bounced into his hands from nowhere---and strolls into the endzone to win the playoff game!
Sounds wild!
It was!  But to this day, Raiders fans dispute the play, saying that the ball bounced off Fuqua, which means the catch was no good.
And then the Raiders would have won the game?
Exactly!
Sounds like one of Aesop's Fables...
Yeah, well the moral of the story is this: "That's just the way the ball bounces!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's it going?
Good, how are you?
Doing well. Just doing some things on my ESPN app.
Who are you watching?
The Eagles.
They're mediocre
What about the others?
Like who?
Seems like you don't like football.
I do!
But why do you not know the other teams?
Because I like Philly Cheese Steaks!
Oh. Who else do you watch?
Not much else.
What about the Rams?
Nope.
The Lions?
Nope.
Do you watch Jessica Namath?
Yes, because of that fox fur jacket she wore!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Cam Newton?
I think he is an alright quarterback.
I think he is very good.
His size gives him a great advantage.
He is a good person on and off the field.
I have heard he does some charity type work.
He does.
I think the best quarterback in the league is Drew Brees.
He is a good player.  I think he is past his prime.
That may be true.
I think he will be slowed down quite a bit this year.
I sure hope not, I really enjoy watching him play.
Are you planning to go to any games?
I haven't decided yet.  How about you?
I usually try to get to one every year.
What game are you thinking this year?
I think I will be going to the Chicago game week three.
That is smart.
Why is that?
Go to Chicago early in the season before it gets cold there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to any NFL games this upcoming season?
I hope so! We usually get partial season tickets.
For which team?
The Giants.
Ah, that's good. They have exciting games.
Yea, they're definitely better than the Jets.
Are tickets to the Giants and Jets the same price?
Honestly, I never even checked for the Jets.
I don't blame you.
Right. Besides, my uncle is a Cowboys fan.
Ah, so the Giants Cowboys games are the most important to him
Yea for the only reason that he wants to make it a competition with my dad
Do you always get those tickets for that game?
Usually. I sometimes don't get to go though.
Why not?
If my dad and uncle are going, sometimes they want to bring my grandpa with them
Ohh. Does your grandpa like the Giants?
Of course! Although he says hes a "New York" fan
What does that mean?
That he'll root for the Jets too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the football season to start back up! Are you excited?
Definitely!  I've been keeping up with the Dallas Cowboys all summer.
Me too.  I think Dak Prescott will be just as good if not better this year.
I do too.  What the Cowboys needed to do this offseason was strengthen their defense.
I totally agree with that.  Their offense was extremely good.
I think they kept most of their offense.  I do think they added some defense to the roster.
After watching some college games, I hope they added some players from Alabama!
That, or made some trades with Green Bay.  They had a good defense last year.
They really did.  Do you know who they got for defense?
I can't think of any names off the top of my head.  You know, I think they should hire Demarcus Ware as a coach though.
Oh yeah!  He's fantastic!
So who do you see in the superbowl?
Without seeing a preseason game I would say Dallas and Denver.  You?
I agree with Dallas for the NFC and I'd put Houston as the AFC side.
That would be cool! A totally Texas superbowl!  I'm not sure if Houston is that good though.
You never know with them.  I do know they've made a lot of changes to their team.
I still think Denver would get the AFC side.  I know Peyton's not their anymore but they are still good.
Denver takes a lot of former Dallas players so that is what makes them good.  I wonder who their quarterback is.
I don't know but I'm excited to find out.  I know preseason is only preseason but I'm still going to watch all of the games that I can!
Me too!  August can't get here soon enough!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Colts?
I do actually.
Is it your favorite team?
It is indeed.
Mine too.
Maybe we should watch a game together.
Sounds good to me.
Why do you like them?
One player got me to love them.
Who is that?
Dwight Freeny.
Why him, isn't he a defensive player too?
Yes he is.
Why do you like him now?
Right, he was a small defensive end pass rusher.
He was rather unique.
His spin move was the best in the game.
I agree with that it was great.
I miss him.
He retired early.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Eli Manning is better then his brother?
It is hard to make that decision.
I know, we need to see how the rest of his career plays out.
If he wins one more superbowl it is almost definitely Eli who is better.
It is crazy he already has two at this point in his career.
You can't leave out that both his Superbowl wins are against the Patriots.
Exactly Brady will always regret those games.
He could have seven rings at this point instead of five.
Brady is still a great player.
Yeah but having seven rings he could be better then Michael Jordan.
Do you think you can really compare Football to Basketball?
I guess you are right.
I know I am right!
Don't forget you actually have to win more games to win an NBA Championship.
More games means more chances to win.
That is a good point.
The NFL playoffs are single elimination so it is much harder to win a Superbowl.
That can be debated as winning 16 games is harder then winning 3-4 games.
We can continue this argument another time.
Sounds good to me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Yo
Let's get this ready
For real
Pro bowl is gonna be fun
Gotta have a party though
Well duh
Obviously it's gotta be a smash
Need some beers
And we gotta make bets
No betting on NFL stuff
What?
As I said
But why
Because I said so
But
Nope
But I know what team will win
Still
Your no fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey sis, it's almost time for some NFL watching.
Oh Lord.
What's wrong?
That means I won't hear from you again until February.
Ha, you crazy.
It's True!
Yes it is, but you know I love me some football.
I hope your team remembers how to play this season.
Oh you got jokes. My Panthers will be just fine.
If Cam gets back in the game.
He was in the game last season, but Luke got hurt.
Oh yes that's right.
He was hurt at the beginning of the season and it went downhill after that.
Hopefully he'll be back this season.
He will. Plus Olsen is going to help out more.
He plays great already. I like that dude.
I do too.
They need more good defense players though.
That's true. I haven't seen the new roster yet.
I hope your Panthers get far this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
I love football!
Oh, really?
Yea I love watching big men collide with eachother
That's a little different...
They're so big and strong and...
A bit of a different opinion...
Their tight butts working it hard!
Dude...
What?  They're so hot!
Okay.. but do you like the game itself?
Sure!  As long as one of my boys are playing!
Your boys?
Like Payton Manning!
Oh, he's a great player!  One of the best QBs!
Oh I totally agree!
Did you see the last game with...
He just has the cutest butt!
Okay I think we watch for different reasons...
Oh, maybe so!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright, but how are we gonna get out?
Simple, we use the door.
Ummm.... (tries to open locked door) it's locked.
Oh great, now how are we going to get out?
Depends.
Uhhh, try using that crowbar.
Uhhh.... (Whacks crowbar at locked steel door). Doesn't work.
Okay, try ramming it using that lawn mower. Here's the keys.
Okay..... (rams the adamantium laser door with steel traps on it). Uhhh, does this door get even worse?
Somehow, it does.
Try and get Superman to break it down!
Hey, Superman, can ya beat down this door in MetLife Stadium? We're trapped!
(Superman comes down, tries to beat down the door, but sees Kryptonite on it as well) Superman says: "Maybe you should get Marshawn Lynch to do it." Superman flies away
Wait, what did he just say?
Uhhh, be right back, calling Marshawn Lynch.
Hey, Marshawn!
Hey, Cody!
Can ya help us out with this door? It's literally locked!
Yeah, let me just open it from the outside!
Marshawn Lynch opens it from the outside with his hands!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's it going? Are you pumped for the upcoming NFL season?
Yes I am, I have been counting down the days until it begins.
Me too, I am really looking forward to seeing my favorite players.
Same here, who are you most excited to see play?
Ezekiel Elliot, I want to see if he has another monster season.
Yeah he was amazing last season.
It was pretty awesome to see a running back dominate in the era of passing the ball.
Yeah, he was just on another level.
Who are you exited to see play?
I am very interested in Mitch Trubiski.
Yes, he has a lot to live up to with the Bears.
He will need to become a franchise quarter back for them.
I think they will have a decent season, maybe make the playoffs.
Yeah, but that division is tough, the Packers, Lions and Vikings can all have good seasons.
That is true, guess it depends on a lot of factors.
It does, a lot of it depends on if teams can get out to a good start.
Yes, if the Bears start 4-0 they will probably make it to the playoffs.
I can agree with that.
So are you going to go to any games next season?
I might, I'll let you know so we can go together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about the NFL.
Okay sounds good to me!
What team is your favorite?
Chicago Bears.
Mine too!
What player is your favorite?
Eddie Jackson.
Oh mine is Jordan Morgan.
Oh interesting.
Yeah I always make sure I go to games when I can.
Oh lucky, I wish I could go to some.
I used to just watch on tv but now I go to them.
We will have to go together sometime.
I agree.
I also want to go to the next super bowl game.
Me too!
Let's make a plan to go.
Sounds great.
Talk to you later.
Same!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to an NFL game.
No I have not.
You should go some time.
Have you been to games?
Yes, a couple of times.
Where did you go most recently?
I went to Lambeau Field.
That is in Green Bay correct?
Yes it is.
So you watched the Packers?
Yup.
Who were they playing?
They were playing the Chicago Bears.
Neat.
It was a very close game.
That's fun, how were the fans.
It got a little intense between the teams fans.
Rivalry games will do that.
They do.
Sounds like you had a blast.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey?
What are you doing right now?
Just betting online for the football games.
What website are you using?
BetOnline.com
Oh, wow.
It's pretty dope, huh?
Yeah, but it feels to me a little suspicious....
Really?
Yeah......
How so?
I don't know. It feels like gambling in football is a little too awkward
Dude, if they can gamble in poker, tennis, and horses, I'm pretty sure football's part of the list, too.
Okay, makes sense.
But don't you think they rig some games?
WHAT??!?! How can these games be rigged?
You never know, man.
What do you mean?
Behind the scenes, some billionaire eccentric may decide this team should win or lose, depending on how much money he gives.
Hmmmm, tell me more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for NFL games again.
Me too! Pre-season starts next month.
The Bucs should have a good year.
I don't know about that. Doug Martin's suspension could hurt them.
They are stacked with Running Backs and Martin will be back once the suspension is over.
That is true.
Charles Sims is back from his injury to lead the Backs.
Who do you think will start?
Jaquizz Rodgers showed promise last season but I think Sims will get the nod.
The Bucs were hammered with injuries last year.
They will have a good group of receivers this season.
Did they draft any receivers?
They drafted OJ Howard from Alabama.
That is a good pick.
Combine him with Mike Evans and Winston has two great targets.
They still have Vincent Jackson too.
He is getting older and playing less but Adam Humphries doubles as a receiver and tight end.
If they can get past the Atlanta Falcons they might own their division.
That's the plan. I can't wait to watch all the games.
I might go to a couple in person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Thoughts on the AFC West? Should be competitive this season.
Agreed. This should be a tough division this year.
A lot of quality teams in this division, some seem to be on the precipice of being powerhouses.
I don't know about powerhouses, but there are a few teams that should be really good.
We have to see how the additions from the draft and free agency impact the balance of power.
I like the Chiefs a lot this year. I think the combination of the defense and efficiency are what puts them a shade above the field.
Good point. Defense is becoming more rare in this league.
Plus, it just seems like the team is due. You look at their record over the past two years and see how underrated they are.
True, but they always disappoint when the big game comes along.
Denver also has the defense, but seems like they are starting to slide.
Maybe. But a solid defense gives you the ability to hold things together until the offense can develop a rhythm. I'd have to look at their schedule.
Maybe Paxton Lynch shows some growth and they can surprise us.
It seems like they've shifted quite a few things around on offense that doesn't make it easy for him.
You want to talk about QB play, it's hard to ignore the Raiders with Carr.
Hard to get a read on the Raiders, not sure if they just had a lot of luck and good bounces last year before Carr's injury or if that is legitimate.
Seems like Del Rio really put some fight in them and Carr just developed into a machine.
The Raiders defense is the big question mark. They are actually on the right track for once and drafted pretty well but not sure how much defensive help they'll get right away.
Fair. Plus we've yet to see whether or not Carr is 100% after the leg injury.
Signed that record-breaking big money contract, I don't think they'd put pen to paper if the leg wasn't healed. Then again it is the Raiders.
Ha. Good point. Should be a battle in the west.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for 3 days of football a week!
Yeah I know! Sunday, Monday and Thursday funday returns!
Have you decided if you are doing any fantasy teams this year?
Absolutely! Ever since the draft, I have been doing my research on the players, teams, and schedules to figure out who to draft.
Who do you think will have a breakout season this year?
The hometown Philadelphia Eagles seem to be the best team out there in my mind. So much talent and youth to excel in this league.
Carson Wentz showed us he was the real deal last year. I am definitely onboard the Wentz Wagon!
Who would have thought that a kid from a small school in North Dakota would be the savior that the Eagles were looking for?
Well the Eagles may be a whole lot better this year, but they still need to go through Dallas to get to the Superbowl.
Yeah talking about a good team, I can only see this team get better over time.
Absolutely! As it hurts me to say this, but I really like the talent they have on the Cowboys.
I dunno who is the better quarterback, Dak Prescott or Carson Wentz.
I want to say Carson as he needed to work with less and seemed to be a better player in the long run last season.
Not taking away from Carson's accomplishments, but Dak was definitely on fire more times than not last season.
True. I do think that whenever these teams play each other, it's gonna be a battle to the end each and every time.
Yes, they match up very well and will be fun to watch.
Any feelings towards the other teams in the division?
No not really. I think the Giants will be ok, but it is all dependent with Odell Beckham and how he pans out this season
You can say that about Kirk Cousins on the Skins
Yeah he is definitely hit or miss.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of this upcoming season in the NFL?
I'm excited for it. I think there will be some great teams to watch.
It seems like an exciting rookie class.
For some positions, yes. I think it is a strong running back class, but quarterbacks, not as much.
There have just been so many changes recently with locations.
I know. LA went from having no teams to having two.
And then Vegas now has the Raiders.
I just don't see how that will work well to build a fan base.
I know. At least in LA you have a lot of people all over. Vegas seems a little remote for a team.
I feel the same way, but I guess if they were offering the best deal, it looks good to the Raiders for now.
Very true. How do you think the Texans will do this year? I feel like they are so close to a breakout year.
Well, they still need to work their quarterback situation out.
They got Deshaun Watson though didn't they?
Yes, but just because he was strong in college doesn't mean that translates to the NFL.
Very true. I guess not everyone can be  Dak Prescott.
No, not many rookies come out their first year and play like that.
I still think they have all, or at least most, of the pieces in place to finally do something really good this year.
I guess only time will tell. I think the Raiders are really going to continue the momentum from last year.
They should be fun to watch.
But when it comes down to it, I think the Patriots are going to repeat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl VII.
The perfect season.
Yes, Miami over Washington.
Where did they play?
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Who were the coaches?
Don Shula and George Allen.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Bob Griese and Billy Kilmer.
Who scored first?
Miami, touchdown pass.
What happened in the second quarter?
Miami scored another touchdown, a one yard run by Kiick.
Who played at halftime?
Woody Herman and Andy Wiiliams
What happened in the third quarter?
No scoring.
And in the fourth?
Washington scored a touchdown on a crazy play by Garo Yepremian.
I remember that.  Too little, too late.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Browns ever be good?
Maybe
They were so bad last year
Don't forget the year before
They need better draft picks
I like their pick this year
It was better than their other picks
Why are they so bad?
They have bad management
That must be the reason
I think they will get better though
Me too
They can't be bad forever
True
I feel bad for the Cleveland fans
Well, that city has other good teams
I think they can get better in two years
On the bright side, they had one home win last year
That is true
At least they did not go 0 and 16
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for football.
I am always ready.
I am excited to see how far the teams will go. I am too.
I wonder where the superbowl will be this season.
I heard it is going to be held in a new place.
Really? I wonder where,
It will be in a new dome in Minneapolis.
Wow I wonder when it will be.
It will be held February 4, 2018
That is normally the month super bow is held.
Yeah I think it is nice it will be in a brand new facility.
Do you know what the dome is called?
Super Bowl 52 will be played in Minneapolis at U.S. Bank Stadium
What team is that?
The viking.
Oh yeah, Minnesota Vikings.
The building was just built in 2016.
Yeah I heard that before.
It can fit alot of people.
that is good. I am excited to watch
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can start to feel the excitement for the upcoming season
Yeah tell me about it, I have been too long without some football.
So how do you think your favorite team will do this year
I am optimistic, but waiting to make sure no major injuries in the pre-season
What do you think their record will be?
Well I really hope for a playoff appearence dont really care about the record
Yeah I guess you are right
As long as they get into the playoffs it does not matter if you were 15-1 or 8-8
That was some superbowl last year
Yeah what a great come back
I do not think anyone can doubt Tom Brady now
I agree but you know there will still be some that do
I think he is the best ever
It is hard to argue with that after another superbowl win
Of course it does not hurt having Bellichik as his coach
I do not think one would be as good without the other
It is like a perfect match
I wonder if we will ever see something like them again
In this day of free agency and injuries I think it would be hard to duplicate
Well lets just enjoy the moment then
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you hate most in the NFL?
It is for sure, the Steelers.
Why do you hate them the most?
The NFL seems to favor them. They always  get all of the breaks.
Is that the only reason?
Heck no. I also cannot stand their fans. They are very annoying and are bandwagon fans.
Are you sure that your not generalizing?
Maybe to a point but still, the majority of the steelers fans that I know have no ties to the city or team whatsoever.
Don't fans have the right to root for any team that they want?
Of course. However, it is still frowned upon to be a band wagon fan and root for a team just because they are good.
I could understand that. However, nobody likes to root for a loser.
This is true. However, it builds character being a fan of a bad team.
Any other reasons why you dislike them so much?
I also can't stand how annoying their fans are. They just seem very rude and classless.
I think a lot of NFL fans are like that these days.
This is true but I have met some fan bases that are good fans and treat you with respect.
What fans base did you like the most?
I think 49er fans were very respectful when I went to see a game there.
Did you like any other fan bases?
Surprisingly, I found cowboys fans to be quite respectful when i saw a game there as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about dem Browns?
what about them, they are always terrible anymore
Yeah, but it is like spring training.
sure, no losing record yet at least.
Dude,they are getting better
really, they say that ever year, and the pftttt
Look they have like a zillion new draft picks , high one.
They don't have a quarterback still.
they have a couple guys who could be OK
They have a couple rookies and a veteran, just like last year.
The Browns didn't waste any time getting guys who got hyped up like the last two years at least.
Yeah, If I ever hear anybody say "Johnny Football" I'll punch em.
I know, that's to funny like nobody could see how that was going to play out.
Nobody wants to play here.
I don't know, this coaching staff  is getting me a little more confident.
But nobody gets to stay more than a couple years, they can never even get their program of the ground before they are fired.
I think they learned that lesson finnaly, a couple of those coaches were victims of stupid front office and owner moves.
That owner is an idiot.
He probably is, but he seems to have backed off telling the football guys what to do.
Maybe, he must get embarrassed owning a team that literally everybody else points to as a way not to do things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the NFL season to start!
How many more days until kickoff?
We still have to wait 59 more days.
That is not that long! How do you think Deshaun Watson will do this year?
I think he is overrated and will not make a difference on the Texans.
I don't know, the Texans have a great defense and their division includes the Jaguars and Titans. I think that alone has gotten them into the playoffs the last couple of years. Watson just needs to be average.
I agree. That Texans defense is Nasty.
Do you think we will see some improvement from the Colts and Andrew Luck this year?
Luck is not a bad quarterback but I think they have team management issues so I expect that they will underperform again this year.
I am not a fan of Luck, I think he is has decent skills but he gets way too many passes from fans about some of his play.
I feel the same way about Russell Wilson! He is decent and has a terrible offensive line in front of him, but he also holds on to the ball for way too long sometimes.
I agree. I also find the entire Seahawks team to be very unlikeable.
I do too. I am so glad they didn't make it to the Superbowl last year. I think they will miss out again this year.
I think so too. I also don't expect to see the Panthers back in the playoffs. Cam Newton is either really great or really awful. There is no in between with him.
Yeah, and I saw that Kelvin Benjamin is still struggling with weight issues. Maybe drafting McCaffrey will be the difference they need.
Maybe, but they are still in a tough division. The Saints have a horrible defense, but you can't ever count out Drew Brees, the Falcons will be tough to beat if they do not experience the "Super Bowl Hangover" and Winston and Mike Evans on the Bucs will be no easy task to defend either.
That is a weird division. I think Brees will retire soon.
I hope he does. He is great to watch, unless he is playing against your team!
You are right. Once he retires I am not sure what the Saints will do.
I know, and they just keep pushing their salary cap issues down the road. That will eventually come up and bite them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's nearly football season again
I can't wait
I know, I get all pumped up inside thinking about it
I need to place an order for some football gear pretty soon
Oh yeah, that's right.  I want a new Lion's hat.
HAHAH.  Lion's huh?  That's cute.
What?  They play every Thanksgiving you know.
Yeah yeah....and what's their record I wonder.
Well, I don't know, I don't follow them that closely.  My kid wants a fidget spinner too.
Yeah, I need to get a Brown's, Colt's, Patriot's, and a (shudder) Jet's fidget spinner when I place my order.
Wow...why so many?
All the kids.  They all want one, even the two adult children.  Can you believe it?
Hopefully they will include a season schedule this time.
For what?  The Pats?
Yeah.
Why don't you just download the app to your fancy phone?
I dunno.  I like looking at something I can keep in my wallet.
Yeah, but the app is cool cause you can set reminders and preferences.  It's handy.
I dunno.  Does it cost?
Nope...do it today!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see report on ESPN about concussions in football?
I did, they are devoting  a lot of time to it.
Do you thinks that the players claims are ligitimate
Yes, a lot of players hide their injuries just so they can  keep playing
Have you talked to any teams about it?
I spoke to the  Jets, Giants, and Falcon.
Are they going to change any of their protocols?
I think they are. The Jets have bought on a consultant
Is the consultant a medical doctor?
Yes, this Doctor used to work with the Cowboys a few years ago
Did the Jets have to run this by the Commissioner's office?
I think someone high up placed a call to someone in his office
I assume their office would want all teams to do the same thing.
I'm not sure. They do not want any more press on this subject
That's true. Have you from any quarterbacks on this?
I have calls into Brady, Brees, and Rogers.
I would be surprised if you hear back from them
Yeah - me too.  I'm holding out hope though
If you get just one quote from them, you'll be good
I think I might have to place a few more calls to Dak, Matt , and maybe even Eli
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL preseason is right around the corner !
I know I'm so excited I can't wait
me too. I can't wait to see all the new faces on new teams
omg right! I can't believe Peterson isn't a viking this year
yea he was on them for years! he's hands down the best running back ever
you think? he think he'll be good this year
yea with brees as this quarterback and a great team like the saints he will.
only a few more weeks to see and find out lol.
I'm also excited to see lynch back!
I can't believe his back!
beastmode !!!!
lol. the raiders are my surprise pick for the super bowl
oh boy have a big hill to climb to beat the patriots.
I know I know. but I have faith, especially with carr coming back healthy
oh yea that's right he was hurt as soon as they got to the playoffs last year
yea and then got knock out first round thanks you the terrible back up smh.
it'll be a great match up. I have to go with the Steelers this year
oh I like that one too. I hope its either one of them and not the annoying pats
hahaha I agree
let's go .... anyone but the pats!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's almost August! You know what that means!
Football!
Yeah man! You going to any of the games?
Yup, I got my cheese head ready for the Packers game. Can't wait till we play the Patriots
That'll be a tough game but do you think we have a chance?
Hope so. Rodgers is always good we just need to play strong.
Yeah, do you ever miss Farve though?
Of course man, he was one of the best.
Can't believe he's still playing though.
Wait didn't you hear he's coming back to Green Bay?
What? No way!
Yeah, I can't believe it either since he's like almost 50
Dang, that's a lot older than the other guys on the team
True, but that skill level though
You're right. I wonder how it's gonna go with Rodgers on the team
Dunno, will be great to find out though
Yup, that's why I can't wait till next month
They probably won't play much in the preseason though
You're right, but still it's so close
We should go to a game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Broncos need to step up this year...man, do I want to see them go to the Superbowl again!
I absolutely hear that!  Gone are the days of John Elway, but we can always hope a miracle happens and Denver's QB manifests this season with a fraction of Elway's powers, my friend!
Well, if we just have an exciting season will make it worth it...it has been a long time since I viewed a Broncos game that might be deemed boring, one-sided or unsurprsing...
Tell me about it!  Not a year goes by that the match-ups don't seem fresh...
Yeah, even with all the advance technology, player and game data and statistics, etc., at our fingertips, the game still just boils down to the physical game.
Are you planning on seeing any Broncos games if they play here against Dallas?
Nah...I seriously don't want to have my spleen ripped through my nose by disgruntled Cowboys fans!
Really?  Were you ever at a game where the Cowboys lost to the visiting team?
Twice.  Once, when the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cowboys, and another when it was actually the Broncos who totally stomped the Cowboys' score-wise...I was chased, both times, by unhappy, inebriated. sore-losing Cowboys fans who were displeased with my choice of fan-wear: a Denver Broncos jersey, of course!
Wow!  How'd you get out alive from Cowboys stadium both times?  Ha ha ha!
The first time, I essentially sprinted in terror until I reached my car and locked the doors!
And the second time?
I feel a little guilty about it....
Guilty?   What in the heck for...?!  Tell me!
Well, okay.  Yeah, the second time  I was at a game the Cowboys lost, my "escape strategy" was swapping out my Steelers jersey with a Cowboys jersey in a stall in the men's restroom.
Oh, you've got to be kidding!  You didn't!  Betrayal!
Dude, look, seriously...  Am I proud of it?  No.  But when it became apparent the Cowboys weren't going to pull off a tie, much less a score of any kind in the "not-humiliating" category, I wasn't taking any chances...!
Hahahaaaa!  You coward...!  Who DOES that in 2017, during NFL season?  Disloyal fan!
Don't give me a hard time.  Lets watch some NFL Summer Camp footage, huh?
Gimme a beer and the remote, buddy ol' pal!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did marshawn lynch retire again
No but he should i think
Why dont you like him
Because he isnt as good as everyone thinks
Dude have you seen his stats ?
Yeah and they dont impress me
I dont like him as a person also but he is a good player
Ok he might be decent but thatts about it
Alright dude lets talk about someone else
Alright what do you think of tom brady
Dude hes a cheater
No they lied about that
No way there is so much proof saying otherwise
He has evolved so much since then so it doesent matter
Yeah cheaters never change and he still isnt better than peyton
Sure peytons good but hes no tom brady
Peyton has a lot more history than brady first of all
Yeah but that means nothing
He has not become great from just history but his games also
You know nothing about football
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't like when people try to predict how every NFL team will do beforehand
Why not?
I don't know. It takes the fun out of it.
Do you play fantasy football?
No. That also takes the fun out of it.
It certainly gets involved.
I like the predictions that the Bills will do well this year
I've always liked them as a team.
I remember they went to the superbowl against the cowboys when I was a kid
Who won?
The cowboys
Oh, that's dissapointing
Yeah. I think the Dolphins will do well this year
Me too. I never liked Dan Marino
Who is their new quarterback?
Matt Moore
Is he a big guy?
He's 6'3"
That seems about average
He's a good player
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Patriots will repeat as Super Bowls winners this year?
As a Patriots fan, I'd like to think so.
But in your unbiased opinion?
Well, we will have to see. They play some good teams this year.
Yeah, but they don't have that hard of a schedule.
I think their strength of schedule is twelfth, but that doesn't really mean much before the season starts.
Fair, but who are they playing that you are worried about?
Worried may not be the right word. Apprehensive though; the Chiefs, Texans, Falcons, Broncos, and Steelers for sure.
I don't know. Texans still don't have their quarterback situation figured out. Maybe the Falcons only because they have something to prove.
Exactly. And the Steelers game is away and it isn't easy to play in Pittsburgh.
As much as I hate to admit it, I just don't see anyone in the league who will be able to touch them this year.
Once we get to post season though, I imagine we will face the Raiders and they will be tough this year.
Oh, that's right. They got Marshawn Lynch didn't they.
Yes. And I can't imagine they will throw the ball on the one yard line if they can run it with him.
That couldn't be a reference to Super Bowl 49 could it?
You think? It should be a good year all around.
I know. I'm excited for it. I think the Eagles may be able to step it up this year.
Maybe for the first four or five games just to give their fans some hope.
And then go back to being the Eagles and crush all hope for the remainder of the season?
Exactly! August just needs to get here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see any of the pregame stuff yet?
Nope, I think t starts soon though.
Oh sweet, I believe the Packers preseason games is at the end of August.
Oh cool, any work on Clay Matthews health?
Uh oh, I have not heard anything bad coming out of camp have you?
Not other than he had a might cut his long hair.
Ha! Good one!
The game that I really wanna see of the Lions vs. the Packers.
Hopefully Stafford is ready.
Yeah, I know the game is on November 6th.
The last time they matched up it was for the NFC North Title.
It feels like that was a long time ago.
I know man I feel like I am ready for some football and hot wings.
Do you ever play fantasy football?
Yep, but just between my wife and I.
Oh right on thats cool.
yeah, you should mention it to your wife and see if she would be interested.
I can try but she loves shopping on Sundays!
You might save money but getting her to watch football?
I couldn't agree with you more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey dude
You again?
Are kickers players
Are they on the team
Yeah
Then they're players
But they hardly do anything
They have important roles in the game
Not really
Field goal kickers can win games
and lose them
what about punters
Yeah they're barely players
I can't even name a punter
There's that dude on the Steelers who interesting
Yeah. You see him for like 3 times on a game
But you know he's there
You sure do
NFL needs to be more entertaning
it does
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best quarterback in the NFL right now?
I would have to say Tom Brady. And that's saying something because there are some other really good ones.
I have to agree. The numbers he put up last year even after missing the first four games were amazing.
Yes, and he's absolutely ageless it seems.
I think there are others who are really good but fall short.
I would say Aaron Rodgers is the next best, but he was inconsistent last year before turning it on later in the season.
Yes, Rodgers when he's on comes pretty close to Brady. What other quarterbacks are up there?
I've always liked Ben Roethlisberger, but he gets hurt too much and may be tailing off now.
Yes, he has the career success that puts him up there. I think Matt Ryan is very good, but needs to do it for longer.
Ryan had a fantastic year last year, but I think a lot of that had to do with Julio Jones.
That's probably true. I think Drew Brees is still really good and Andrew Luck has the talent, he just needs a better line.
I feel like Luck may be a little overrated because people were wowed by his talent.
I think the next couple of years will tell us a lot about Luck and how good he really is.
Yes I would agree with that. Which young quarterbacks do you like?
I think Mariota, Winston, and Carr are poised to be good for a long time.
I think Matt Stafford is moving up my list with the numbers he's put up.
Stafford to me is just empty numbers though, he's never proven himself to be able to elevate his team.
I don't know I just think he has had bad teams around him.
What about Prescott in Dallas? He had an amazing year last year.
I wonder if a lot of that was due to the players around him. Plus it's only one year, he has a lot more to prove.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was that blackk guy. Played for the Canadian teams before NFL
Warren Moon.
Yeah, he was old too when he retired.
Go Huskies.
What?
I went to UW. We're Huskies. Warren Moon was our QB when he was undrafted and had to go play in Canada.
How come he wasn't drafted?
NFL didn't think he was good enough.
or that still thre were racism back then, this was when?
This was... 1978, I think. And there has been a black QB in the NFL since 1968.
Huh. Who was that?
Marlin Briscoe for the Broncos in 1968. he wasn't very good, and turned receiverer after sometime.
Who was the first starting QB who was black?
That'd be James Harris for the Bills, he started the season opener. Funny thing is Briscoe was traded to the BIlls as a receiver.
Wait, that's how Briscoe became a receiver
Yes, Bills thought Marlin would be better as a receiver, and the first black starting QB passed a few to the first black QB who became a receiver
That's a funny story
True.
This was right after the civil rights movement.
Yep, right at the end of it more or less.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you as excited as I am for the upcoming season?
Heck yeah! I miss football
I hope the Broncos do better this season
Me too, last season was a big let down
I know! especially coming off our superbowl win the previous season
Everyone doesn't think we're as good as the chiefs or raiders.
Just like how Von lost out on defensive player of the year last year.
Just because we didn't make the playoffs
We'll prove them wrong this year. Von sounds motivated losing both the sack title and defensive player of the year.
Hungry Von is best Von. Im not worried about our defense though.
Yeah they always ball out. We got a lot of questions on offense
No doubt. We definitely need to improve everything on offense
Hope who ever wins the starting qb job does good.
Yeah theres a really good battle during training camp
I guess thomas and sanders both are backing Siemian.
Really? I hope that extra year helps him out. Lynch has the better tools
Yeah I would love to see the Broncos toss bomb down field again. To stretch the field
Yeah as long as our line play is better we should be good. And a run game would help
Lets hope Anderson and Charles stay healthy
Lets hope everyone stays healthy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Patriots coach?
He is alright
I always think about the year they cheated
That was odd
They did not deserve the title
I am glad they lost the title
Me too
That was an epic game
The one against the Giants?
Yes
I cannot believe the Giants won
They had to
Really?
If the Patriots won, it would have been the biggest disappointment ever.
I agree
You cannot cheat to win
There is probably other cheating people do
I bet
Do you think steroids should be illegal in the NFL?
Of course
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's only a couple more months and then the wait is finally over!
You must be talking about football season, I can't wait to see how my team does this year!
Who is your team? I'm a big Jets fan...sadly.
I'm sorry to hear that!  I'm a Giants fan, but I do pull for the Jets as long as their not playing eachother.
I feel the same way.  Growing up my father was a Giants fan and my Grandfather was a Jets fan, so I always pull for both.
Do you remember the one year when they thought there would be a "subway series" between the 2 teams!?
I think that was back in 2008, that would of been amazing if it happened.
At least the Giant's have won a few superbowls and who could forget the most recent in 2012.
Oh yes, I did love that the Giants beat the patriots that year; I can't stand the Patriots.
Me either, they are cheaters and I hope they do horrible this year.
I do too, however unfortunately it seems like they'll never have a loosing season.
I don't like Tom Brady, he's so cocky and then there's the whole "deflate gate"!
He is such a loser and I hate that people from Boston will defend him till the day they die.
Once a cheater always a cheater; thats why they call the coach BeliCHEAT!
I don't like that guy either, remember the scandal where he got caught filming the Jets during practice??
How could I forget it! That just shows they need to cheat in order to succeed, I just hope the Jets beat them at least once this year.
I'm sure they will, they usually win one and loose the other against the Patriots.
Who do you think will be in the Superbowl this year?
It's tough to say before the season starts, but I'd love to see Jets vs. Giants in my lifetime.
HA! Me too, but then we can't be friends anymore lol.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Alshon Jeffrey have a good year this year?
I mean hes not getting passes from Jay Cutler for once.
But he seems to not be able to keep his body healthy
Thats the best ability in the NFL, availability.
I think he can post career numbers with Wentz throwing to him.
But do we know how good Wentz is?
He showed promise last year.
Plus Jeffrey always had a good back to take off pressure.
Forte was barely used in Chicago
There was always the threat of it though.
Yeah true, I guess you could say he was aided.
Why would he have signed a one year deal after playing on a one year deal?
The market dictates that nowadays.
So you think he couldnt have gotten a better deal anywhere?
No I think it would have been too tough.
Someone surely would have given him multiple  years
Look at Terrelle Pryor.
What about him?
He also got a one year deal
Maybe this is how teams deal with free agents going forward
XXXXXXXXXXX
Think the Bills will be any good this year?
Not good enough to beat Miami and New England. They won in spite of themselves
What about 12 gauge?
Not good...
What happened?
Looks like he is on his way out.
He is not looking good, huh?
New coaches don't like him
Shame...was hoping he was gonna make it
I did too. Watch, he goes somewhere else and becomes a star
HAHAHAHAHA...yup, got that feeling too
They have nobody to throw it to.
All they have is McCoy.
And Sammy Watkins, right?
Whatever. Dude's always hurt
Think he's fool's gold?
Looking like it. Wasn't the best receiver on his team
Who was?
Robert Woods...51 receptions, 1 touchdown
Wow...holy cow
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the NFL season?
Not really it has become more about making money for the owners than serving the fans.
Why do you think that?
In the past several years teams have moved from one city to another so the owners could make more money and not cared about the fans left behind.
What else is the cause?
The owners want the taxpayers to finance a new facility rather than find the means to do it themselves.
Do You think the teams are playing well?
Not as well as they did a decade or 2 ago.
What makes you say that?
There are too many penalties and the players are not paying attention to the rules and fundamentals.
Do you have a team you like?
Yes I do.
Which team is that?
It is the Packers.
What makes the Packers one that you like?
They put a good product on the field.
Is their anything else?
They have to be tough to play home in the middle of winter.
Is there another reason?
They are usually a team in the playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's tough being a 49ers fan these days.
I don't even know who the quarterback is.
At least it aint Colin.
Yea, he was a cancer.
I quit going to games because of him.
Because of the protest?
Yea! My brother died fighting for that flag.
He shoulda picked a better time.
I agree.
I quit going to games cause we suck.
Yea, the days of glory are long gone.
You mean the Elvis Grbac years?
You are funny, I'm talking about Young and Montana.
Montana is the greatest of all time.
You think he's better than Brady?
I know he is, and young was right up there too.
I didn't hurt to be throwing to Rice.
They had some other good receivers too.
I love how Rice would use the referee as a pick.
Seems like that should have been illegal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how are the Steelers going to do this year?
I think they have a chance to be really good.
Do you think they're better than last year?
I think so, as long as Martavis Bryant comes back strong.
So you think he can be a big difference maker?
Definitely, they lacked that strong number two receiver last year.
He stretches the field too, doesn't he?
Yeah, you have to respect his deep threat at all times.
But how do they beat New England?
They have to start playing man-to-man.
Do you think they have the players to do that?
Probably not, but Brady is going to burn you either way.
But doesn't man-to-man make it worse?
Death by 1000 cuts is no better than losing to quick strikes.
You're looking at a blow-out then though.
Not if the offense can keep up and the aggressive defense creates a few turn-overs.
So do they make the Superbowl?
Most likely not.
How far do they go?
They'll probably lose in the AFC Championship to New England, haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't  wait for the NFL season to start
Me too, I'm going to some preseason games
Really? The rams, right?
No, I'm flying back home to catch a ravens game
Man I love the ravens
Me too, ever since they won the superbowl
Yes, 2000. Nobody thought they would, right?
I was barely paying attention to that game.
But it was prettty cool. I don't even mind the bandwagoners
Yeah, the team was young then
It's so fun to go to the game, isn't it? I love games.
Bundling up in the winter, getting a cold brewski
Wearing my favorite jersey,
I bleed purple!!
I know, me too.
I hope the rookies from the draft are good.
Me too. I want another championship
I think this is the year, I'll be there, my work got some box seats so we can catch a few games this season
No way, where are the seats?
The 50 yard line. Isn't that awesome ? I love football.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the party?
I think so. I think I have everything.
Do you have the turkey?
I have the turkey.
DO you have the cranerry sauce?
I have the ranberry sauce. I have the green beans too?
Good. And the stuffing mix?
Yes. I have the stuffing mix.
Do you have everything you need to make gravy?
Yes. I have all the fixings!
It sounds like you are ready for the Thanksgiving Day Party!
Yup. Although I still have't gtten the television fixed.
What? THe television is still broken?
Yeah. Maybe I'll hear from the shop on Friday.
But Friday is after Thanksgiving Day!  How are we going to watch the Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys play football if our television if broken?
Now, don't make such a fuss over this.
A fuss?  Thanksgiving Day is not Thanksgiving Day without NFL football!
I know the Lions and the Cowboys play on Thanksgiving Day every year. We will just have to miss watching them on our televison this year.
This is the worst!  This may be the worst Turkey Day ever!
You can stop crying now because I rented a 56-inch plasma TV from Rent-A-Center for Thursday. I am smart enough to know that if you didn't get to see football on Turkey Day, then you would not let anybody else digest any of this food all day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, football is almost back!
I know man!  Are you playing fantasy this year?
Of course.  No way I'm drafting Russell Wilson, ever again!
Yeah he was horrible last season.  My Seahawks were so injury prone.
Yeah, they need Beast Mode back.
Didn't he sign with the Raiders this year?
Yeah, dude.  I'm not sure how that's going to go to be honest, but I hope they beat the Patriots.
Seriously, somebody needs to.  Tom Terrific can't last much longer.
I don't know man.  He says he's playing until age 45.
That would be insane!  I wouldn't mind having him in fantasy next season, to be honest.
Yeah, but I want my boy Aaron Rodgers again.  Dude is insanely talented.
Yeah, but he plays in the cold like six times a year.  That can hurt fantasy stats.
Very true, and it's toward the end of the season too, when you need the most out of him.
Hey, your Browns had a pretty solid off-season!  Do you think they will win more than one this year?
I don't want to get too hopeful, but yeah I think that's a safe bet.
Who's going to be their quarterback?
I think Kizer will win it.  He's the most physically gifted.  Hopefully Hue can get his head on right.
Yeah, he had a pretty horrible last season in college.
Either way, we have Myles Garrett now, so hopefully the defense improves.
I don't see why it can't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know much about the NFL mascots?
I know some don't have official mascots and that some are really weird.
You are right, the Red Skins, obviously because of political correctness.
Who else? And why don't theses others have official mascots.?
The Green Bay  Packers, New York Giants, and New York Jets don't have any  either.
Some of them are just creepy or really poor quality.
Some of them are pretty awesome. Bolt Man of the San diego Chargers looks like Jack Nicholson. Look it up.
Alright hang on.....Oh my goodness it really does look like Jack Nicholson!
The creepiest one to me is Jaxson De Ville. He looks like Chester cheetahs' pedophilic nephew.
Ewwww that's just gross!
Well it is what it is.
i wonder how much money the mascots make?
They average around 25k and some as much as 65k a year.
Holy cow I had no idea.
Denver Nuggets mascot Rocky is supposedly one of the highest paid NFL mascots.
I guess the difference in pay is due to how well the team is doing.
Yeah that would be my guess.
Interesting  things about the other side of the NFL.
The sad part is the mascots get paid more than the cheerleaders.
Once again women getting screwed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, there are some football players who have some famous ancestors.
Like who?
There's Justin Fargas for one.
I don't know who he is.
He used to play for the Oakland Raiders.
What famous person is he related to?
Antonio Fargas who is an actor and is best known for playing Huggy Bear in the old Starsky and Hutch TV series.
Who else is related to someone famous?
Steve Young.
The quarterback for the 49ers?
Yes.
I can't think of who he might be related to.
Brigham Young.
The founder of the Mormons?
Yes. Steve is his great great great grandson.
Wow. That's an interesting fact.
Even some college football players have famous relatives.
Name one.
Jesssie Bongiovi. He's the son of John Bon Jovi.
That's surprising he didn't go into music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How's the Raven's looking so far?
Good! They are rocking the training camp this year.
Right on.
And the schedule looks interesting as well.
How so?
Well, in Pre-Season they face the Bengals, the Browns and the Jags.
Well, lt sounds like a secure 2 out of three wins.
Haha, yeah.
Who's next on the list?
Raiders and Steelers. Those may be a bit harder.
True. But we'll see.
Then there's the Bears, Vikings and Dolphins.
Hmm, that could be another three wins.
More than likely.
Titans, Packers and Texans up next.
Oh, well that could be a problem. Titans and Texans look good this year.
Well, hopefully by then they will be good enuf to beat them.
Hopefully.
Then the roster recycles.... should be routine by then.
It should be a good season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what NFL players do you think are going to have big years?
Tom Brady of course, and AJ Green.
Are there any others you can think of?
I think that Matt Ryan will continue to dominate. What about you?
I think Aaron Rogers will have another big year.
He is getting older, but he will have a great year I expect.
Yes, health seems to be the biggest key for him.
He has been putting up MVP numbers when healthy.
I expect more of the same type of dominance.
As do I.
Are there any other players you think will continue to flourish?
Gronkowski seems like a good choice, but he is injury prone.
Yes, he does have quite the history, but he always bounces back strong.
Yes he does, he is like a tank engine.
I think the Patriots, in general, will continue to the flourish.
I know! I can't believe they won the Super Bowl in such fashion.
We will see how they do this year in the NFL.
I think that it is inevitable that they will have a great year.
Ultimately, time will tell.
Yes I agree. Go Pats!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So it looks like the Texans are getting a new Quarterback coach.
Really? Do you know who?
Yes, Sean Ryan is his name.
Right on. Is he any good?
Yeah. He was the recievers coach but thet bumped him up for 2017.
Very cool. I hope he works out.
Me too, i'd really like to see the Texans go to the palyofs this season.
I would as well. I'm thinking the Cowboys wont.
I agree. Tom Savage says he's looking forward to the new coarh.
Hopefully he will help Savage get that ball downfield.
Yeah, Osweiler was pretty useless last season as a coach.
True. I think he did nothing for Savage last year.
Yes, when a coach gets a 40 million dollar contract, he better help the QB get the ball to the end zone.
FORTY million?
Yes, he was getting paid more than top players.
That's sad.
I have a feeling this season will be much better.
I'm hoping it does.
Well, we'll know in less than 90 days.
I know, i cant wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
whats up dude
nothing much
who you watching
the bears
whats the score
its tied
whos winning
the cubs
dude. did you just throw and offhanded ferris bueller reference at me?
sure did
haha good one
thanks man
doesnt change the fact though
what fact
the bears are horrible
they are
then why are you watching
its the only game on
id rather watch badminton
then your weird
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is looking really good this year to go all the way?
I think the Cowboys have a good chance, but then there's always the Patriots as well.  Should be interesting.
How do you think Romo will do in broadcasting since he's now retired?
I think he will do great.
Do you think Romo will ever make it back into the NFL?
I don't know, man, I think as a player, no, but as a coach someday?  Maybe.
What do you think about Dak Prescott?
Dude, he's awesome.  I think he has potential to be one of the greats.
Did the Cowboys pick up some quality players in the draft this year?
I think they did, as they were definitely looking to fill holes in the defensive line.
What other teams do you think will do good this year?
As always, I think the Packers and Seahawks will be good.  Other than that, it's anyone's guess.
What about the Texans and their new quarterback?
I think he has potential but will just have to wait and see if he can produce.
Do you think JJ Watt will come back strong?
I sure hope so because the Texans definitely need him.
I wonder how many more seasons Tom Brady has left in him?
Man he's like the man of steel and indestructible.  I doubt he's going anywhere anytime soon.
Are you excited for the season to start?
Very excited!  I cannot wait to see what happens in the preseason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Just 3 weeks until NFL training camps open.
Can not wait!
My Titans are going to be really good.
Why you say that?
Well, Mariota gives them a passing game.
He should be goodl
He's been working with Manning!
That will speed things up.
They also beefed up the O-line.
That's good to hear.
Derrick Henry should be a beast on short yardage.
That should improve red zone efficiency.
Still need defensive work.
They're an enigma, sometimes really good.
They came along in 2nd half of last year.
They've go a terrific LBer core.
Yeah, they just need help in secondary.
Could be a weakness.
Still, I think they can move the ball better and that will hide some weaknesses on defense.
Playoffs sound like a probability then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much Fantasy Football are you doing this year?
I'm going with 4 different leagues, what about you?
I'm down to one right now. I'm working on some other NFL projects instead.
I know - it's hard to keep track of all the teams and the players
I'm starting to research the salary cap more and which teams are most affected.
Are a lot of teams up against the cap?
I'd say more half the teams including the Cowboys and Patriots
What about the Giants?  Are they going to have room to resign Eli to one more contract?
They have the room, but I doubt they with that young kid in the wings
I thought the same about Brady, with Garrapolo still on the roster
Jimmy G will have to be paid one way or another.
Well, Brady has said he's playing till he's 45
I know he is good now but at some point father time will catch up
I agree, it's just hard to imagine given how well he's playing.
I know - the drop off will be quick. Remember Peyton?
I do - but he had all of those neck issues.
True, but all it takes is one wrong move, and there goes the know
Brady takes care of himself, so I think it have to be some sort of freak injury
That's why they are keeping Jimmy G around
I think its a good idea to be planning ahead like that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Brown's will be the worst team in the NFL this season?
I don't know. They made some nice moves in the draft.
They did but it is a long term strategy. They will grow over the next couple seasons.
At least they didn't waste any more picks on quarterbacks.
It will be interesting to see how Brock Osweiler performs in Cleveland.
Where was he before he got traded?
I think he was in Houston.
That is right. He did alright down there.
It is tough being a Brown's fan.
At least we have good company. I heard Lebron James has season passes.
If Myles Garrett comes back strong from his injury we may have a chance at a win this year.
I heard that one of the rookie QB's might start over Osweiler.
Maybe Kizer or Kessler. If they do they wasted a trade on Osweiler.
That is typical of the Browns.
Are you going to any games this season?
I might go to one or two games.
I have not decided yet if I will. Tickets are really cheap this season.
Not as many season pass holders this year for the Browns.
Hue Jackson will turn things around for the Browns.
If he doesn't they will fire him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you feel that the beginning of the NFL season puts you in a festive mood?
Somewhat...Football season feels like a long Holiday season.
How divided is your family in regards to their favorite teams?
Oh wow! Half the family are Dallas fans and the other half are Redskins.
Really?...Thanksgiving must be Hilarious? There is always a Redskin & Cowboys matchup.
Yes it is. After dinner and during the game it's a divided family room but you love every minute of it.
Isn't it crazy how Football can tear your family apart one minute then heal you in the next?
It's awesome, our family has always been divided in the NFL. But, if it's none of our teams in the Superbowl we always celebrate Superbowl Sunday together.
What team do you go for Redskins or Cowboys?
Redskins Baby!
I like the Redskins also but their quarterback needs to improve his game this season.
I agree, but he also need more help from his offensive line.
Who won the game last Thanksgiving with the Redskins and Cowboys?
Them girls did...aka the Cowboys.
The girls?
Yeah...we call them girls with their pretty tights, it's all good!
Do you like to watch football games outside on inside?
I love the dirty side of football, it should always be played when it's cold and rainy.
Do you personally know anyone that plays in the NFL?
No, but I did have a cousin that went from college to the Baltimore Ravens practice squad but he never made the cut.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest running back in NFL history?
Good question so many hard choices.
Many backs to think about.
How about Jim Brown?
I'm not old enough to remember him?
How about OJ simpson?
I was a kid when he played, all I know of him is the criminal cases!
How about Barry Sanders?
I think he was great a shame he retired early.
He had some moves.  He would have had the rushing record had he played longer.
He was the greatest at least in terms of being able to make people miss.
What about Walter Payton?
I really didn't see him play much either, he was older when I remember seeing him play.
What about Emmit Smith?
He was a good running back, and he had a great line in front of him. He has the all time record but played a long time.
He was the best in the 1990s.
What about Marshall Faulk?
He was great, but maybe not the greatest.
The list is so long I cannot decide.
We still have not talked about Marcus Allen, Adrian Peterson,Jerome Bettis, Eric Dickerson.  I'm going with Barry Sanders.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i miss the old nfl
yeah me too
Old time football
Dick butkus
Mean Joe Greene
Lester Hayes and his stick um
I know right. He use to have that crap all over the place
Helmet. Hands. Legs. Feet.
I'm surprised he didn't stick to the ground.
That would have been funny.
Was nice when people were allowed to hit people not like today.
Nowadays if you look at someone wrong you get a flag.
I know its stupid.
Like the stupid celebration flags
No Fun League
it is
They forget why people watched to begin with.
Thats why ratings are going down
They sure are
Goodell has to go
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi what is your plan this weekend?
Hello, I will just stay home instead
Would you like to go with us this weekend?
Where are you going guys?
Don't you know the incoming NFL champinship?
Is it?I thought not this incoming weekend
Yes. It is
What time you will go?
Probably at noon time
Let me know the time then
Who Am I gonna be with except you?
Dennis will go with us and three other more

What time will be the game?
AI think 3pm, I'm not sure
Alright just let me know then
Possible at noon time just get ready
Sure, I will.
See you then. Have a nice day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can not wait until September!
What is so great about that month?
The NFL will be back and I am really excited about it!
Who is your favorite team?
I am a huge Kansas City Chiefs fan.
Are they supposed to have a pretty good team coming back?
We should be pretty good yet again, at least I am hoping!
How did the team do last year?
We were pretty good; we finished 12-5 and went undefeated in the division.
That sounds like a really good season. What happened in the playoffs?
That did not go so well! We lost to the Steelers by two points.
I bet that was a very tough loss to swallow.
It most certainly was. I did not watch the rest of the playoffs after that.
Wow, you must have been devastated in order to miss the rest of the playoffs.
I was; I do not take losses like that very well at all!
How do you feel overall about the coaching right now?
I feel that Andy Reid has done a pretty solid job so far.
Has he ever guided a team to the Superbowl?
Yes, he actually took the Philadelphia Eagles there several years ago.
Well, maybe he will get the Chiefs to the same point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how old were you when you started watching football?
football period or the nfl?
the nfl.
i don't remember. what year did the eagles lose to oakland in the super bowl?
that was back in 1981. for the 1980 season.
oh okay. so that means i was nine years old.
that young?
yep. i didn't understand it.
so why did you watch it?
because the home team eagles had made it to the championship.
i know right.
my dad and all y uncles had a super bowl party.
man who was the eagles' quarterback back then?
ron jaworski.
yeah that's right.
his nickname was jaws.
i remember him. he still does the monday night games with gruden i think.
yeap. jaws been around for a hot minute.
a long hot minute.
i just can't wait for the season to start.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ready for some NFL football?
My jersey hasn't been worn in 6 months. I can't wait to break it out.
Who is your team?
The Patriots are my passion.
I can't stand the Patriots but I recognize they are doninating the sport.
You can't argue that Tom Brady is the best QB in ages.
Maybe he is. He has had a strong team surrounding him.
True and we have a great coach.
There are a lot of good quarterbacks in the league.
I thought Aaron Rodgers would have had a great season last year.
Me too. That guy is distracted my something off field.
Brett Favre never let the pressure get to him.
It is a shame Favre didn't retire with the Pack.
At least they retired his jersey.
I know but he went and played for the rival Vikings.
You do what you got to do.
That would be like Tom Brady going to play for the Giants.
Peyton Manning continued to play for the Broncos and got another Superbowl ring.
That was inpressive.
It was a beautiful way to retire after a wonderful career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many NFL teams have not won a Super Bowl?
There are thirteen actually.
I didn't realize it was that many!
Yes. The Browns, Lions, Texans, and Jaguars have never even been to a Super Bowl.
How do they still have fans?
I don't know. But what is worse is that the Bills and Vikings have been there four times and never won.
Ouch. Yes, I definitely think that is worse.
Ok, so that is six of them. What about the others?
The others are the Titans, Chargers, Eagles, Bengals, Panthers, Falcons, and Cardinals.
I'm surprised the Cardinals haven't ever won.
They've had a few good years, but never sealed the deal.
The Falcons were close last year.
Tell me about it. That may be the most heartbreaking loss!
I don't know. I wouldn't want to be one of the two who went to four and never won.
It's even worse for Buffalo.
Why is that?
They went four years in a row and lost them all.
Ouch! Was the the early '90s.
Yes. '91-'94. They lost to Dallas twice, Washington, and the Giants.
NFC East can be a bear!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite team?
The tennessee titans.
Oh.  Do you think they will do well this year?
Yeah.  I think they have a decent shot to win the division.
Will Mariota play at the beginning of the season?
I think he will be ready by then.
He just needs to stay healthy for the whole year.
That will be the key.
What else do you like about the team?
They have a pretty good offensive line.
What about their running backs?
Demarco Murray did pretty well.  I think he was third in rushing yards last season.
What about their receivers?
I think they have a good young bunch.
Do you think they will develop this year?
Yes.  I am expecting Tajae Sharpe to step up and have a breakthrough year.
Didn't they get Decker?
Yeah.  But he is getting old.
You don't think he will be a playmaker?
No, probably not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man. About a month left before football starts.
More like about a month left before Brady get shis sixth.
Oh, man, here we go. They won't even take the AFC this year.
Man, you're crazy. Who's gonna beat them?
I don't know... Just potentially the Chiefs, Ravens, Raiders, Steelers, or Bengals.
So the team they beat to go to the Super Bowl last year is somehow going to beat them?
It's a new season, man. Anyone can win!
Yeah, besides the Bills!
That much is true. That's a universal truth: the Bills are terrible.
But seriously, the Pats have the best team. How can you deny this?
I'm not denying it. But there are some other great teams in the NFL this year.
The Cowboys look great too, I will admit.
Them. Also, I think the Falcons are gonna stay consistent.
Blah, blah, blah. They can never recover from that last Super Bowl embarrassment.
We'll see! They will definitely be in the playoffs.
Where they'll fizzle out! I wonder if they can even beat the Panthers this year!?
Oh, come on. Cam is done.
How is Cam done? He was MVP two seasons ago!
Well, he peaked, if you ask me!
Well, I guess we will see in about a month!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Oakland Raiders?
Yes, they have won 3 Super Bowls.
They have been in 22 Playoff appearances.
Their first home field was Kezar Stadium.
I liked it when they were in Candlestick Park.
They were not there long.
Las Vegas Stadium is planned for 2020.
They have had a total of 444 wins.
They have 397 loses.
It was controversial when they moved to LA.
They went back to Oakland in 1995.
They have an extensive fan base.
And distinctive team culture.
14 members are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
Oakland Senors was going to be their original name.
Jim Otto played on the team.
I liked Tom Flores.
I liked when Al Davis was coach.
He was good.
John Madden used to be their defensive assistant coach.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won the Superbowl last year?
New England...again!
Oh, yeah, now I remember..I was thinking Broncos
That was the year before. Against Panthers.
That's right. Kind of weird now I think about it...Panthers!
Yeah. With the cry baby QB...what's his name?
Cam Newton?
Yeah, that's him. Didn't do so hot last season did he?
Not as good. What about Wilson, though?
Russell Wilson? He's still good.
You think Seahawks still has a chance?
I think they are still good, but they need better defense though.
i kind of like the Seahawks too.
I thought you were a San Francisco fan.
Not so much any more. I think the Raiders are better than them now.
Yeah, they did play good last season.
Them and Minnesota.
Yeah, that was a bit of a surprise, though.
I'm glad because I don't care for the Packers.
I don't think anyone does besides those cheeseheads who actually live there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the New York Giants will do this year?
D=Not sure...depends on Eli
You think he'll turn it around?
He could...don't know if he wants to
Well they were 11-5 last year.
But he only threw for 26 tds last year.
But they made the playoffs last year
...and got embarrassed too
Odell and Victor have to play well
Yup. Not even sure who their running back is
I think it's Jennings
Whatever...just hope they can beat Dallas
Didn't they beat them last year?
Yup. Both times too...
I think that's their first game this year
It's an away game too
Well the runninggame has to be there
I just think they have enough
They'll beat Dallas like a drum
Maybe, maybe not
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I just got offered box seats for next seasons 49ers games
Wow that's awesome! How much are they?
The guy said he's not going to be using them and he won't charge us.
Well are you going to take them?
I don't know. We don't really know too much about football.
You're right. I don't even know the name of any players on the 49ers.
Me neither. But if we had box seats for all season we would learn.
That's true. And it's nice to go to the park.
Yes, I do enjoy the excitement of the competition and the crowds
Ok. Let's do it. Maybe we'll become huge 49ers fans
I suppose we could do some research before we go. Maybe read up on the team
True. We could check their website and learn the players and coaches names so that we would look like we know a little.
Right. And maybe we could get some jerseys so we fit in.
You know I like clothes shopping. Yeah, let's get into the SF 49ers fashion
Ok. But I don't want one of those jerseys with the players name on the back. Someone will inevitably ask me something about them.
And you won't know who that is! How hilarious
Well I'm going to tell my friend that we'll take the tickets
Ok, I'm on the 49ers website right now. Let's see, who is the quarterback?
At least you know the names of the positions!
That's true. So, what's your favorite postion?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about deflategate? Did Tom Brady really do it?
Yes. Tom Brady did engage in deflate gate. He is trying to make up for getting older. He is 39 and competing with guys way younger.
Who is your favorite football team? Mine is the Lions?
Mine is the buffalo bills. I know only a sadomasachist would like them because both always lose.
Are the Lions going to make it past game one of the playoffs ever?
No. They never will in a million lifetimes. The thought of uplifting Detroit is impossible.
What was your favorite team of all time?
I would have to say that would be the Chicago Bears back when they went to the super bowl. They used to have a song that was cool.
Who is your favorite quarterback of all time.
It has to be Jim Kelly because he was my neighbor when I lived in buffalo. I used to toilet paper his house when I was 12.
Who is your least favorite quarter back?
Of course Tom Brady for being arrogant. Him and his wife appear to be complete narcissists.
I read that the Detroit Lions will beat the Green Bay Packers this year online.
That is a delusional fantasy. That will never happen in a million years.
What is your opinion about Matthew Stafford?
This is why the Lions never go beyond the 1st game of the playoffs. That and their inability to keep a coach.
Who is your favorite Lions player in 2017?
Of course Marvin Jones the only good one on the entire team.
Who is your favorite Buffalo Bills player?
They are just going to lose the entire season so not worth even mentioning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, will you be watching some NFL games this season?
Yes. I will be glued infront of the tv, rooting for the Jets.
Hopefully 2017 will be better for them than last year.
I know they did not do to good last year; ended the season 5-11.
Don't feel so bad, my team did bad to.
What team is that?
New Orlean Saints. They ended the season 7-9.
They did better than my team.
I heard the Jets snagged a good draft pick this year; the player went to LSU.
Oh, yeah. Your talking about Jamal Adams.
That's the player. I hear good things about him.
So did I. Did you know George Adams is his Father?
The George Adams that played for the New York Giants in 1985?
That's right. Get out of here.
I'm serious, and what is crazier is that they were both first-round picks.
Like father like son, ha ha.
I guess we will see what he can do.
Hopefully a lot, because my Jets need all the help they can get.
Agreed. And remember you said that.
There is no denying it. Good luck this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite NFL team for the coming season?
I don't know. I haven't been keeping up with them.
What, really? Well, who do you like in terms of players?
How about Kirk Cousins?
Kirk Cousins is good, he played for Michigan State University.
What is he doing now?
I think he's still the quarterback with the Washington Redskins...
I think that sounds right.
And, he is doing really well these days!
Really? That's cool!
They didn't want to play him much at first.
Why wouldn't they do that?
Apparently, the team thought a lot of other guys were better.
Didn't he end up playing after a couple of the main quarterbacks got injured or sidelined?
Yes, that sounds about right.
Well, Kirk Cousins definitely showed the fans that he's got it going on!
That's so true, they didn't know how good he was until he finally got his foot in the door.
That just goes to show that stats aren't always the best predictor.
Definitely, if more teams gave the back-up quarterbacks a chance, there would be more diamonds in the rough!
Then again, when you are at the level of the NFL, you're already the top of the top, so being able to get the foot in the door is the most important thing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
This season closer game should be interesting.
Hopefully better than thier season opener.
Ouch.
It's true.
They lacked manpower this season.
How?
Two top players out for the season.
Which ones?
Alfred Wooten and Colin Pores.
Not good.
I think they'll pull through.
If thier new guys are worth it.
I think they will be.
You do?
Next season they'll be more prepared.
Will the guys come back next season?
Not sure but hopefully.
Changes happening.
Let's see how they close out.
Let's see, my friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, are you a football fan?
Oh yeah, love watching football.
Who's your favorite team?
I'm a huge Seahawks fan.  I'm from Seattle originally, so I love the 'Hawks.  Who do you like?
I'm a Kansas City fan.  Love the Chiefs!
Yeah, I live in Kansas City now, so I root for the Chiefs too.  Unless they're playing the 'Hawks!
I think the Chiefs are going to do well this year.  I'm sure glad we got Andy Reid a couple of years ago.
Yeah, he's a great coach.  I'm a big fan of Pete Carroll too.
Yes, he's done a great job with the Seahawks.
I was so disappointed when Marshawn Lynch retired.  And now I'm hearing talk that he's thinking of coming back and playing for the Raiders!
Yeah, I heard that too.  I guess he's from Oakland.
Yep.  The sad thing is, they're eventually going to be moving to Vegas, so he won't even be playing in Oakland.
True.  You guys have got a great quarterback in Russell Wilson.
I know, I love Russell!  I was worried that he wasn't going to sign a couple of years ago, when his initial contract was up.  But he did, thank goodness.
The Seahawks have a lot of great players - maybe they'll be in the Super Bowl this year.
That would be awesome.  I just hope it isn't against those darn Patriots!  I hate Tom Brady!
Well, he is getting old.  But I haven't heard any talk about him retiring.
Man, I wish he would retire.  I'm so tired of him.  That Super Bowl a couple of years ago where we lost at the last minute was such a bummer.
I can imagine you were really disappointed.
Yes, I was!  I didn't understand why they didn't just give it to Marshawn and let him punch it in.  Instead they threw that pass that was intercepted.  Darn it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the NFL season to start!
Me either! This is going to be an amazing season.
Yeah it's hard to tell who is going to the playoffs. It's a passing game, with a look of talent at quarterback this year.
Don't forget about the receivers.
I haven't forgotten but receivers mean nothing without someone to get them the ball.
Same goes for the other way around.
Ok, so who are the top 3 receivers that realistically can help carry their teams to the post season?
Antonio Brown, Odell Beckham Jr., and Julio Jones. In that order.
There is no way OBJ is better than Julio Jones, and what about Dez Bryant?
Dez is good, but he has nothing on the other 3 and even if he did, he isn't carrying Dallas to the playoffs
Ok so what about OBJ and Julio Jones.
Well I'm a Giants fan so I have to give it to my boy
We agree that Antonio Brown is the best receiver in the league though?
Definitely, his numbers don't lie. He's got over a thousand yards in the last four seasons and coupled with the Steelers defense, they will definitely see the playoffs.
No credit going to old man Big Ben.
He's only 35!
Yeah but every year he get's older the ball is going fly a little shorter and less hard.
Might be true, but he threw for almost four thousand yards last year so the age isn't showing.
Steelers in patriots in the big game?
Nope. It's going to be a rematch of last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Patriots Repeat?
They are still the team to beat.
Tom Brady is ancient, but he still finds a way to win.
They can never put a hand on him.
The Patriots line is always a strong point.  They have a perfect pocket for Brady to throw from.
The Pats always find a way to squeeze the most from the players that come there.
It is just too early to think about who can knock them off.
Teams look good, but then they find a way to lose to them.
Stuff breaks that Patriots way a lot.
Even when Brady was out last year, they found a way to win.
The Pats don't ever seem to have to rebuild.
Even when they are not great, they are still really good.
You just have to wonder when Brady is going to fall off.
You mean like how Peyton Manning's play dropped when he left Indy?
Brady has been playing at a high level for a really long time.
You never know when age is going to creep up.  It might be this year.
Brady is talking about playing a few more years.  It is hard to argue with it.
Teams have a hard time getting to him, but those nfl hits can be tough on a qb.
The Pats probably protect Brady the best out of the nfl teams.
Yep, his jersey is not dirty most of the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So time is getting close....... bout a month away till Pre-Season
Yes, i was just thinking that.
So for the opening, who's house do you want to watch it at?
Well since it IS Tampa VS Miami, it should be my house.
I had a feeling you'd say that.
Well, Pappy is stupid for Miami so he wont leave the house on opening day.
True. We arent gonna do steaks are we?
Probably not, it's a 1 o'clock game.
That's right, i forgot.
Tam will probably make Nachos, and we'll get chips and snacks.
Will there be any 4;15 games this year?
Well, on October 1st theres one.
Very cool.
Then 4 days later they play the Patriots for a night game. Prolly too late for steaks.
Ugh.
On the 15th they play Arizona at 4:15, that woud be a good game for steaks.
Right on! i'll even host that one!
Thry only play the Falcons at 8:15 like 2 months later, all other games are at 1PM
Well, at least there will be a couple of games we can grill out.
We can always do hot dogs and burgers for a game too ya know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really excited about the upcoming season for the Detroit Lions?
Really, why is that?
Well, the polls show that 64% of the people think that the Lions will win the North this season!
So, who came in second?
Well, the Packers came in second and then the Vikings were third.
That doesn't really mean that the Lions will win, though
That is true, but they have had a losing streak for so long that it COULD happen.
Could and should aren't necessarily the same.
The Lions nearly beat the Packers last year, so that's a good sign.
Well, "Almost" and "Nearly" are only good in horse shoes and hand grenades.
Oh, I don't know about that.  Practice and the will to win factor in, too.
Well, if you look at their past, the Packers have at least had 3 championships in the last 60 years
True, but Drew Stanton seems to have a good head on his shoulders
Yes, but one person can't hold up the whole team.
Well, let's hope that the coaching and the team finally have a chance to gel. 60 years is a huge drought.  We need some rain.
Well, even a sprinkle will help.
In the meantime, I'll continue to go to the games.
Yes, at least the food and drink are good at Ford Field.
So, let's get some tickets for next fall?
Sure, but you're buying!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hi there
Want to talk about football?
Sure
Its a great sport
I agree
I love the carolina panthers
They are pretty good
My mom loves them too
Its awesome to share it with family
It is
My dad and i love the cowboys
Thats good
Its fun watching the games together
I agree
Watching football with family is great
Awesome bonding time too
I already got my two year old hooked
Thats awesome
It really is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for NFL?
Yes. Favorite time of the year.
Mine as well.
Who do you like?
I like the colts how about you.
I like the Patriots.
I hope they di good this year.
They always do,
I think that another team will take the superbowl though.
I think the Patriots will still get there.
I think they will to but I hope someone else wins.
Really?
Yeah someone else deserves to win.
I think that also but Patriots are good.
Tom Brady has gotten helped along the way too.
What do you mean.
People cheat and get away with it.
He accepted his punishment.
Correct but it was not a good one.
That is the NFL for you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what's going to happen to Brock Osweiler?
I don't think Cleveland has talked about what they are going to do yet, but I bet at camp there will be good competition.
I think so, I was just worried they might just cut Osweiler before the season even begins.
That wouldn't be very smart because he has good game experience and you never know with these young guys how they will do right out of college.
You're right, but I wouldn't be surprised if he is playing backup this year.
I'm not sure about that. Cody Kessler is not a starter caliber quarterback, it's too much for him.
Didn't they draft someone this year, fairly year on?
Yeah, they ended up with Deshone Kizer out of Notre Dame.
Oh yeah, now I remember that. He went in the second round, which I thought was a steal.
Only time will tell if it was a good pick, but they didn't reach for him and he's talented, so I guess we will see during the preseason.
It's always fun to watch the young quarterbacks be completely overwhelmed by the nfl level play.
It is, but Cleveland has been striking out at quarterback lately, so I think they are ready to win now.
Do you think Brock can help them do that? It seems he had trouble in Houston with winning.
Houston was not the right fit for him. It didn't fit his style of quarterbacking.
I think he was set up to fail in Houston because Bill O'Brien wasn't on board with his acquisition from day one.
That was definitely evident during the season. They had no chemistry whatsoever.
He had some good receivers there, but made such stupid mistakes. I can see why his coach was frustrated.
Denver was much better for him because Elway used his strengths.
Well, Elway had practice since Peyton really looked awful his last season, but found a way to win enough games.
Winning doesn't have to be pretty, teams just want that W!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season to start.
Me either. I still can't get over that Superbowl game.
I know, how the Falcons blew that lead is beyond me. Who are you rooting for?
Well not the patriots I know that. I think Seattle is going to play big this season. What about you?
I am hoping the Panthers will come big this year. Cam Newton is definitely talented.
Absolutely. What do you think about Victor Cruz signing with the Bears?
Oh man, I don't know, he'll always be a Giant to me.
Well Odell definiteyl took his place on the team as the lead receiver.
Yes, but he can't do anything if Eli doesn't tighten up.
Do you think this is Eli's last season?
I don't know but I hope he can retire like his brother Peyton with one more Superbowl win.
A Superbowl win over Brady would be epic!
Yes. Did you get any tickets yet?
Not yet, they haven't released the pre-season schedule.
Okay. Who's you favorite rookie this year?
I haven't really been paying attention to the rookie class this year. Any stand outs to you?
Well, Bleacher Report says The 49er's Joe Williams is someone to keep an eye on.
What does he play?
Running back. The Redskins also have a great new rookie running back.
That's cool, well it looks like it will be an exciting season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many games do you think the Miami Dolphins will win next season?
I think they're going to win at most 8 games.
Really, just 8 games? Why do you think that?
I think it's basically the same team as last year and coach Adam Gase isn't a great coach in my opinion.
I think they're going to win at least 10 games. Ryan Tannehill looked good last season and he's only going to get better.
I like Tannehill and I think the Dolphins' wide receivers have a lot of speed but they're not the best receivers in the game.
They spread the field and stretched it quite a bit last year. I loved it when they aired it out. Tannehill is impressive when he has full control of the offense.
There's more to being a good wide receiver than just speed. You need to have really high field IQ and I don't see any of the current wide receivers having that kind of game feel.
It's really disappointing that Arian Foster didn't work out for them last season.
Well it was expected. Arian Foster is such a good running back but he can never stay healthy. He always gets banged up.
I was really hoping he would have been a good replacement for Lamar Miller.
Lamar Miller looked great in Houston!
I know, there was such regret, but I was hoping that Arian Foster would escape his injury curse.
The lack of a consistent running game did really hurt the Dolphins.
I can understand now why you don't think the Dolphins will win more than 8 games.
Yeah I just can't see it. I know their defense is overrated especially with all the big names they brought in like Suh, but I don't see them competing for a Superbowl.
If the defense ever gets on the same page and puts up a consistent season showing out their potential, the 10 wins are a possibility for me.
Don't forget they're in the same division as the Patriots. That means they have to play New England twice a year!
I have nightmares about Brady but to be honest we always play him tough.
That's true the Dolphins are one of the teams that has mild success in the regular season against Tom Brady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whos your under-dog team this year?
The Dolphins, hands down
will we see another Peyton Manning?
No, that man was a legend
If you had the money, what team would you buy?
Easy, New England Patriots
Why are The Bengals uniforms so ugly?
I don't know, it hurts my eyes too.
I have a hard time crowning any QB of this era as "GOAT"
Good thing my pick doesn't need a crown. Only a helmet, pads and a football.
Don't get me wrong marino Montana and fouts are great and all but I have a hard time saying any of these guys are the GOAT. Could you imagine Johnny Unitas playing in a West coast offense? Joe Namath playing in the air coryell? Otto Graham playing after the Mel Blount rule? You can't touch recievers anymore
I don't think you can really put a value on "taking a pounding."
The reason why time of possession is important is to let your defense rest and plan to attack the offense. Defenses tire faster because they move reactively which takes more burst energy and more oxygen.
Yea. Teams want to play games that feature fewer total possessions against elite qb's
The 2018 NFL Hall of Fame Class may be one of the most Competitive
I don't think Tagliabue is going to get the contributor nod this year. The fact that he wasn't voted in last year after getting it was very telling. It'll be a while before they try that again.
What are your expectations for Jamaal Charles?
If Charles is 90% of what he was in KC and healthy, he turns CJ into a short yardage / goal line back.  But sadly I think he's out of gas. Would love to be wrong on this.
Poor Browns fans and their players it must be hard to watch recently knowing you're almost definitely going to be laughed at come the end of the season.
On a long enough timeline, the success rate for every NFL team rises to 100%. So yes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you think will do well this year?
Hard to say, depends on how the new draft picks do
Are there teams that are rebuilding this year?
Dallas, given Romo is out of the picture
What is the deal with Dallas and the Eagle rivarly?
Not sure how that started. Just seems to have always been there?
What about the new stadiums that keep on getting built.
Teams seem to alway want to be current? People sometime forget the history though
Should there be more teams?
Where would you put one?
What city needs a NFL team?
Maybe Portland
Why Portand?
Well, they had a basketball team for a while. Why not football
What is the benefit of having a team?
Mainly money for the league, as well as for the city?
Do you think that the NFL should require community outreach by the players?
A lot of players are already involved with charitable organizations.
How many years should a NFL player be allowed to play?
As many as he wants. It should be a personal decision as to how long one plays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which sport do you think is the most popular in America?
That would be the NFL!
You are correct, and it really is not even close.
I can see why, football is simply in our blood as Americans.
It sure is; most people probably wish the season could go all year long!
As a huge NFL fan, I can certainly tell you that having the NFL all year would be awesome!
Who is your favorite player in the league if you had to choose?
I personally love watching Odell Beckham Jr. the most.
Yea he is very talented to say the least.
I am not sure if I enjoy his talent more, or his antics the most.
It seems that most really good receivers have a lot of antics to go along with their game.
What about you? Who is your favorite player to watch?
That is a really tough question for me! I may have to say Ezekiel Elliot.
He has turned out to be a really solid player for Dallas.
Yea, coming out of Ohio State I had my doubts about him. He has sure proved me wrong!
What a great combination of players for the Cowboys to build around for the future.
Are you referring to Elliot and Dak Prescott?
Yes, they have both been outstanding so far in their short careers.
They sure have! Cowboy fans have great reasons to be excited for the future.
No doubt about that! I can not wait two follow those two guys' career!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What ever happened to Rick Mirer?
The old Seattle Seahawks quarterback?
The very one.
He started on opening day for a couple of years in the 1990s but after that I don't know.
What is he doing after the NFL?
I have no idea. I know he played in college for Notre Dame.
He apparently owns a winery now in California.
What a good life! To play in the NFL and to own a winery.
He also has a charity.
What is the name of his charity?
It's called the Mirer Family Foundation.
He also played for the Jets in the NFL.
I only remember him for the Seahawks.
He played for the Jets too.
What year did he play for the Jets?
He played for the Jets in 1999, under head coach Bill Parcells.
How did the team do that year?
The New York Jets? They finished 8–8.
That's not too to bad.
No, nor is it too to good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you recall Super Bowl III?
Not really, it was before my time.
Have you heard of Joe Namath?
Of course.
Well, he predicted the biggest upset in saying the Jets would win Super Bowl III
Oh that's right. Who did they beat that year?
The Baltimore Colts.
Oh right, Johnny Unitas at QB.
Yes, they were the heavy favorites.
What year was that?
That was back in 1969, but for the 1968 season.
Wow, that was a long time ago.
Yeah, and they used to play the game in mid-January.
Who was the coach back then?
I don't remember the Jets coach, but Don Shula was the Colts' coach.
Don Shula who went on to coach the Dolphins?
That's the one.
Wow, I had no idea he coached the Colts as well.
Yeah, he's been around for a long time.
Crazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL football.
Yes, I am a big fan.
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Chicago Bears.
Really? I don't know any Bears fans in this area.
I have been a fan since I watched them win the Super Bowl in 1986.
I don't think they have won one since then. Have they?
No, but I am hopeful that they will soon.
What teams are some of their rivals?
Right now, the Lions and the Packers are big rivals of the Bears.
Oh, that's interesting. I know a lot of Packers fans.
Don't introduce them to me!
I'll try not to. Why should I root for the Bears?
Well, their 2016 season wasn't very good, but I think they are bound to turn things around this year.
Who are some of your favorite players?
Mike Ditka is one of my favorite old players, but I like Jay Cutler, too.
I think I heard Jay left the team.
Yes, he did. What a shame.
So do you think I could watch a Bears game with you some time?
Sure, just bring some snacks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Eagles?
I do
They have a good squad
I gotta admit. I miss the old team
You mean the McNabb team?
Yes
They were really good
Yes they were. I liked their old team
Their team now is pretty good too
I don't see them making the playoffs though
They need some work
I think they have a good fan base though
Their games get very crazy
I agree
Have you ever been to a game of theirs?
Not yet
You gotta get tickets
I know. But they are expensive
It is worth it
You are so right. I need to see an Eagles game in person!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for football?
Yes. Always.
I am ready to watch me some Dolphins.
I do not watch them much so I do not know many of the players.
Matt Moore is their quarterback.
I have not heard of him.
he is good for the team.
I will have to watch them more
They are located out of florida.
It would be nice to watch all of the teams.
YEah I try to watch all the games.
It helps when you learn the players.
I agree.
It helps spread their fanbase also.
I like watching every game.
I like the competition.
I do also.
It helps you get to know them as a whole.
I like all of it and buying the apparell.
Me too. I have bought alot of NFL apparel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who you got this year in NFL?
Honestly, not sure, it seems wide open.
Well, I certainly don't have the Bears.
Haha, no kidding, what a disaster that has turned into.
Yeah, they already have a QB controversy and they'll still be terrible.
Just a poorly managed franchise.
Yeah, they're giving the Redskins a run for their money.
Haha, very true. The Redskins missed their opportunity.
They looked fine with Cousins and should have built around him, but, now, there is all this drama.
Yeah, they always seem to have issues.
Plus, the division they're in will be brutal this year.
Yep, Giants, Eagles and Cowboys all look good.
Definitely gonna be a tough division.
Probably the toughest with the AFC South being the weakest.
Yeah, it's Titans or Texans there fighting it out for most mediocre.
Titans could be good if Mariotta stays healthy.
That's a big if though.
That's true, unfortunately. He's injury prone.
I think the Bucs made the right decision with Winston in that draft class.
Definitely true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football!!!! Alright!  Almost time for football!!!
So you like football?
Heck, yeah!  Packers fan for life, dude!
How many will they win this year?
I'm thinkin at least 22 games.
Hmmmm, I think there's only 16 games in the season.
I'm countin playoffs.  Playoffs!!!!!
Ok, so I think that'd make 19 games if they win the Super Bowl.  Where's the extra 2?
You forgot the Wild Card game, dude?  Get your head out of your butt.
So, the Packers are going to go 16-0 and still play in the Wild Card game?  How's that work?
Politics, man, it's all about the politics.  It'll happen.  You just wait and see.
Ok, assuming that they play in the Wild Card game, that only makes 20 games.
You forgot the Pro Bowl.
So the NFC players in the Pro Bowl will all be from the Packers?  You sure about that?
Heck, yeah.  Nelson is going to have 27 TDs and 2,700 yards this year.  And Cobb will have 19 TDs and 1,500 yards.  He's not as good.
Wait a minute.  You're telling me that Rodgers is going to throw for 4,400 yards to just those two players?
Right. I forgot the other receivers.  Well, they'll combine for another 3,000 yards and another 19 TDs.
So now Rodgers is up to 7,400 yards and 65 TDs this year?  It seems that that's a little high.  Is he also going to throw passes to himself?
Why not?  He can do it all.  Football!!!!!!  Go Packers!!!!!  Go beer!!!!!  Go shirtless fat guys!!!!!
You scare me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Football season is almost here!
Yes, it is. Are you ready for some football!?
Of course. Falcons gonna take it all the way this year.
You're crazy. How can they come back from that beat down in the last Super Bowl?
Their offense is prolific. You'll see.
Prolifically silly, considering the fumble they had last year.
Shut up! You know Matt Ryan was on fire last year.
That's true, but that's not enough for a ring.
Whatever. Who will you root for this football season?
I don't really have a team, but I like what the Raiders look like.
Oh, yeah. They are going to be amazing, I think.
I think so too. Derek Carr is an amazing QB.
He reminds me a lot of Big Ben, actually.
I can see that. I think he's better than Cam.
Me too. He just needs a better supporting cast on defense.
Exactly. Their offense wasn't the problem last year.
Yeah, if anything, their offense was too good. Their defense was always back on the field so soon.
Same issue you Falcons had in the Super Bowl!
Oh, man, too soon. 28-3... I'll never forget it.
Good, don't! Use it for fuel next year and maybe they will win a Lombardi Trophy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you heard the latest regarding the Raider Fan fiasco?
Well, not really, what's going on with the Raider Fans
Apparently they're making the final touches for the new stadium, as you know?
Yeah. that I do know.
The new stadium faisco surrounds the horrifying fact that the new stadium will not be able to house all the fans.
That is quite a delemmna
Yeah, I know, to circumvent the problem the want to Shuttle Bus, in the fans, along with regarding others fan to park 3 miles from the stadium.
Wow, what were they thinking when they came up with that plan.
I'm not exactly sure, but I hope that it will not discourage people from attending the games.
Exactly! Which is why it should have been considered long before the last finishing touches to the new stadium.
I totally agree. The idea is to sell more tickets, and get more fans involved, not to discourage them in any way, from attending games.
Right. Nor would the want to be unnecessarily inconvenienced, due to the parking fiasco.
However, maybe somehow it's an upside to all of this.
I'd certainly hope so!
For one, I could think of is less of a frantic rush, when games are over, to make it to the parking lot first.
Right, like a mini stampeded of people trying to be the first out of the parking lot.
Right. It would eliminate and deter that aspect totally.
Resulting in less stampedes to get to their parked cars, and a lot less manic.
Precisely, they'll be a lot more activity surrounding who can make it to the Shuttle buses fast enough instead.
I get that. And a wish to not be on the very last bus that Shuttles them out of the ball park.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Fall especially when football starts.
Me too, nothing better than watching football on a Sunday.
I hope the Patriots can pull out another Superbowl win.
Honestly I'm a little sick of the Patriots they always win.
Well you are from Chicago, the Bears haven't done much lately.
I know but either way I'm sick of the same team always winning.
The Patriots have skills though, they earn their victories.
I'll give you that, what Brady pulled off last year was unreal.
It was, I was so nervous the entire game.
Even though I'm sick of them winning they earned that one.
It helped that Atlanta basically choked.
They did, I think they got too comfortable with their lead.
I agree they starting playing really sloppy.
It must have been fun to be in Boston that night.
It was and then next couple of days, the city was going insane.
Maybe one day the Bears will come back!
Remember 1985, they crushed the Patriots in the Superbowl.
Sadly thats the last time they were good.
Hey you never know, either way watching football is so fun.
It is I like the game and the social aspect of watching with friends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the most overhyped player in the NFL?
Ohhh thats a tough one.
Personally I have to go with Brady
What? Are you crazy?
Well hear me out....
K.
He has a ton of weapons that are big and fast
But very unregarded and undrafted
He has a coach that is brilliant
The coach isn't making the plays
He has a team built around his strengths
Every QB wishs this.
Who is yours?
I would say Russel Wilson
Um I can kind of get that.
I can't stand the guy. He runs and throws but he makes terrible decisions
I would have more grey hair then I already do if i played for him
For sure!
He can make the plays.
No doubt, but he can make boneheded moves too
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think of the Detroit Lions this year?
I don't know, I think it may be the same old Lions again.
Well, I think they might actually have a chance.
A chance for what?
Maybe making it into the playoffs.
Okay, I guess you can always dream about it.
Well, they certainly won't ever be able to top their season in 2008 where they went 0-16.
Hopefully that's not a performance they will ever want to repeat!
Well, now that they have Martha Ford at the head of the organization, we will need to see what happens.
Their record wasn't too bad this past year.
Yes, 9-7.
Certainly got them into the playoffs as a wild card!
I read somewhere that most of the other pro sports teams in Michigan aren't doing well.
True!  It's kind of sad when the Lions are our best chance to get into the NFL playoffs.
There are many people who still keep up hope.  The Lions seem to be getting their roar back again.
Well they just hired some new folks to change up their logo and marketing. Maybe that will help!
I certainly hope so, I hope that with the refresh, they will be able to continue to look forward.
At the very least, it won't hurt them.
We definitely need to break the streak and go to the Super Bowl this coming year!
Yes, 60 years of no Super Bowl is definitely enough!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo
Hey friend
What's good
Nothing much
Yeah same same
Man this game is tight
What game
I am watching sports right now
What game
Buccaneers game on Fox
Having fun?
They are in the end zone hoping for a score
Well hope they do
I am sure they'll score
How you know that
Because their the best team
Well that is true
Best in the conference easily
The other conference blows
For sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm going to watch a rugby game on Friday. Would you like to come?
No thanks. I don't really like rugby at all.
That's surprising. I know you like football, and they're a bit similar
They are I guess. I just never really watched much rugby.
I'm from Australia, so we don't really watch NFL much. Rugby is our thing since we were kids.
I guess NFL is similar for me. Growing up I was always going to the Ravens games with my father.
Are there any NFL teams outside of the US? I know we don't have any in Australia.
No, all teams are in the USA, although occasionally they do play overseas for exhibition games / friendly games.
Do you know if they ever play in Australia? If they do I'd definitely tell my friends back home to check it out.
I don't think so. I know the Jacksonville Jaguars began play one game a year at Wembley Stadium in London.
Very cool. I wonder if it's only in London because there are a lot of Americans living there nowadays.
I'm not sure actually. I remember the Buffalo Bills used to play one game every season at Rogers Centre in Toronto for a few years, but don't think they do it anymore.
Where in the USA are most of the teams? They're spread all over right?
Yes, they're pretty all over the map. Althought there are more teams on the eastern half of the country.
You mentioned you used to go to the Ravens games. Is that in Philadelphia?
No the team in Philly is the Eagles. The Ravens are the "Baltimore Ravens"
Baltimore? I thought you grew up in DC
I grew up in Maryland, right on the border of DC.
Ah so you could have supported either the Baltimore Ravens or whatever team there is in DC
The team in DC is the Redskins. They're a good team as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think wins the NFC West this year.
It has got to be Seattle again.
Yes, it seems like this is a dynasty in the west.
As long as they have the key players on the roster they will be competitive.
I do not see the other teams in the division very competitive other then Arizona.
Arizona could be decent with Carson Palmer and the good receivers they have.
I think Seattle will still have a good defense as usual.
I agree it will probably be Seattle.
Arizona might be a long shot and might make the playoffs.
What about the other teams?
The Rams are a mess I don't see anything happening there.
Do you think Jared Goff starts.
I'm not sure if this kid ever gets off of the ground.
You think they traded away all those picks for nothing?
It could be a long time before that franchise turns around.
Think San Francisco will rebound.
I can't see anything happening with that quarterback situation.
Who is starting anyway?
Will is be Colin Kaepernick again?
I don't think he is on the team this year.  They will probably start Brian Hoyer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading an article a couple days ago about the 2017 Football Hall Of Fame inductees.
When is the Football Hall Of Fame?
The ceremony is August sixth.
I'll have to watch for it on tv on the sports channel.
Kurt Warner is one of the players being inducted.
Wow, he surely deserves that.
I know, Kurt Warner is well deserving of the Hall Of Fame.
Who else are they inducting?
Jerry Jones. Both Kurt and Jerry's wives will be presenters.
That's a nice touch, since families make a lot of sacrifices for them.
Morten Anderson's son is a presenter.
What a great moment for a son to get to honor his dad.
There's only been one other wife who was a presenter, so it's pretty awesome for the wives too.
Who are the other inductees?
Terrell Davis, Kenny Easley, Jason Taylor, and LaDainian Tomlinson.
Are their families presenters too?
No, they have an agent, two former coaches, and a former player.
Who's the former player?
Lorenzo Neal from the San Diego Chargers is a presenter for Tomlinson.
I guess team mates are family to some players since they spend so much time together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey darlin' would you get me a beer?
Sure I will, honey.
Thank you sweetheart.
You are most welcome.
Do you want to watch the game with me?
*laughs*  Not really.  The only thing that interests me are the uniforms.  Who the heck is playing?
Oh, this is Miami.
Why are the uniforms periwinkle blue?
I think they are more like seafoam blue.
No, that is definitely periwinkle.
You could be right, you know that stuff better than I do.
It seems an odd choice for a football team.  Like, you know, it's not an extremely manly color or anything.
Well I don't know but the uniforms are different based on whether the team is home or away.
You know whose uniforms have gotten a lot better over the years?
Who.
Tampa.
Oh yeah.
Remember, years ago?  They used to be like, bright pumpkin orange.
I know.  That was based on what?  Pumpkin colored pirates?  What?
Exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are you feeling about the Cowboys this year?
Really bad.
You think they don't have a chance
No I'm really not a fan these days
I agree, they've been pretty disappointing
I just can't get behind them because they throw away games
You were a fan for so long
Yes since I was a kid but it was just painful to watch really
Do you follow anyone now?
I live on the West coast now so I go to some 49ers games?
I've been impressed recently
Sure not bad at all. I enjoy the atmosphere
I've been a lifelong Saints guy but lately I'm really impressed with the Seahawk
They have a really tight team
It's pretty aspirational I think
It will be interesting to see if they can keep it up
That's the test, my Saints faded away the next year
That's the difference between good and great
Will you be going to the Superbowl
No way. I'll never go again unless by some miracle the Cowboys make it there
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mam, let me stop you there.
Yes?
Is that a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey you're wearing?
Why yes it is. My spouse got it for me.
I just love the Steelers.
Me too. Welcome, nation.
Yes, indeed. Who is your favorite Steelers player?
I love Antonio.
Antonio Bryant? The wide receiver?
Yes, the wide receiver.
Wow, me too!
That's simply amazing.
How do you think they'll do this year?
I think they'll go to the playoffs but lose in the second round again.
Will they play Seattle again?
I hope so. I love those games.
I love them too.
We beat them in the Super Bowl a few years back.
Yes, my spouse and I celebrated for weeks thereafter.
Good times for the Steelers. Good times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't stand the Seahawks.
You sound bitter.
Not bitter, but they strike me as a bunch of cocky jerks.
They play with a lot of confidence for sure.
Their whole defense makes me want to punch something.
Why is that?
Because they are always talking trash.
But they also always back it up.
They've got some good players like Sherman, but even he's having issues with the org.
I know they were trying to trade him this offseason.
Earl Thomas will be back this year.
Yep, wonder how well he'll perform.
He's not as cocky as some others, but I still despise him.
I think he might lose a step, but still the best FS in the NFL.
The person I hate the most is Kam Chancellor.
Dude is a beast though.
Great player, don't get me wrong, but a total knucklehead.
He's got ample amounts of swagger.
You call it swagger, I think he's just a thug and not talented.
He hits like a tons of bricks.  Sorry that disappoints you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the NFL Draft?
Yes, it was boring though.
What do you mean? The Browns got their first pick!
The Browns will still be at the bottom of the league, they are awful.
Years of mismanagement and bad contracts.
And Johnny Manziel? That was a disaster.
You aren't even a Browns fan - imagine how we feel about it.
True, true. Steelers are still going to win their game against the Browns though.
Maybe, we'll see - Ohio sports have had a revival recently - The Cavs, the Indians, the Blue Jackets - all are competitive teams now!
Too bad the Browns can't get any of their players!
Ha ha, Very Funny. Who do you think will win the Big Game, though?
It has to be the Steelers. Big Ben is getting old and he needs another ring before turning it in.
He has to stay healthy, though.
Tell me about it, he is made of glass.
I never hope for injuries, but I wouldn't complain if we had to go against your 2nd string in our meeting.
Steelers can beat the Browns with a cardboard cut out of Big Ben!
Well, Good luck this season - I think we both agree - anyone but the Patriots!
Absolutely! I just hope it's my boys in black and gold.
And I hope it's my Browns! Good to talk to you!
You Too! Go Steelers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite player in the NFL?
Danny Amendola.
What team is he on?
The Patriots
Really?
Yes, he was a big part of their win last year
Was he that little guy?
Yes
Wow, he is good
He played great in the Super Bowl
Did you like that game?
It was epic
Was it the best comeback ever?
No doubt
I thought the Falcons had it for sure
Me too
Just goes to show it's never over till the very end
True
Do you think we will see something like that again?
No way
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch the Super Bowl every year?
Not every year. I've seen a good majority in the last few years, though.
What's your favorite Super Bowl moment of all time?
I think it was the last time the Bears went. They ran it for a touchdown on the first kick of the game.
That was Devin Hester that ran it right?
Yeah. Watching him play kick returns is amazing.
It really is. I believe he's a free agent now.
Yeah, he is.
Who did they play in that Super Bowl? I can't remember.
It was the Colts.
Oh yeah. They ended up losing still didn't they?
Yeah, unfortunately.
The Colts were very good that year, to be fair.
They were. It was an entertaining game, though.
It was one of the more memorable ones.
I also really loved when the Seahawks played the Broncos a few years back.
That was a surprising game. A lot of people were upset.
Yeah, no one expected that outcome at all.
They completely dominated the Broncos that year.
They certainly did. It was nice to see the Seahawks win so big when they were projected to lose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Manning brothers?
I love the fact that Eli Manning won two superbowls.
Yes, and he even got two MVP's.
Who else does that?
I don't know, but that is pretty amazing.
His brother is amazing as well.
What a talented family to be in the NFL.
Sure is.
What other brothers have been in the NFL?
The Watt brothers play for the Texans and Chargers.
Yes, and the Bennetts play for the Seahawks and Patriots.
That must be exciting to share that with your brother.
Sure is.
I guess they probably practiced together growing up.
I don't know, but it would be helpful.
It's pretty amazing to accomplish such a feat in one family.
Yes, it's hard to make it pro.
It definitely is for one person, let alone two in one family.
Football is a challenging sport.
Yes, and these are incredible athletes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is going on with the Steelers?
Big news is Martavis Bryant looks to have turned himself around and will be able to compete this year.
That is big news.  He could really open things up for Ben and the rest of the offense.
I agree, with AB, Leveon and Martavis the offense is primed to perform.
It seems like we've been saying that for a while now.
I know.  The problem is they haven't all been healthy and ready to play at the same time.
Staying healthy is easily the most important aspect of the game.
Do you think teams will work the players less during training camp so as to preserve their bodies?
Honestly, it is a very fine line. If you don't prepare you can easily get manhandled during the season.  Over prepare, and you risk wearing down your body.
I think the league needs to be harsher with guys that are obviously trying to hurt other players.
You mean guys like Vontaze Burfict?
Exactly. I mean I understand it's football, and things happen, but when you witness it over and over and don't address it in the proper way?  I think it is bad for the league.
Especially when players get suspended for a year for smoking marijuana.
Really does not seem to make sense. You treat the guy who could benefit from coddling harshly and then the guy that is flagrantly trying to take out superstars, you coddle.
Seems weird that their HR is so outdated and behind the times.
You would think they would be super progressive.
If not progressive, a little more concerned about the welfare of their superstars.
Sometimes I think they forget the value that these guys bring to the game.
That is for sure. Who would go see the Patriots without Tom Brady, and look how the league treated him.
They need to get their Human Resources act together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your biggest fear when it comes to LeVeon Bell getting a new deal?
I am like coach Tomlin and I don't live in my fears, man
I'd be willing to pay that much for what he brings to the table.
I think they work something out...
God I hope so
Only thing is that he's shown a lack of discipline twice and hurt the team with drug-related suspensions.
Yup.That will always make me worry about a guy's professionalism and commitment after he's paid big money.
Yes...Leveon is the most important player on our offense aside from Ben.
I think Bell will get 11 million a year
But whether it is with us or another team next year is the question.
I have no fear that Bell will perform as an elite back when healthy and available.
Future injuries are what I worry about.
He willll still do better than most rbs, but it's a tough job.
They usually burn out at 30.
I think he will last longer than that though
RB is a position that takes a lot of abuse.
True. Guys don't last very long there and Bell has a history of injuries.
Yeah...I think one more injury and he is done.
Please do not say that...lol
Sorry, just the cynic in me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm sorry to say I'm a fan of the Cleveland Browns.
What's wrong with being a fan of the Browns?
Nothing I guess, it's just they have a bad record.
This year or consistently?
Consistently. They were 3–13 year before last.
Wow, that is bad. And didn't they have the worst record this year as well?
Yes, they were 1–15.
At least they drafted first.
Yeah, that's one positive.
Yes, yes it is.
Who did they choose with that draft pick?
They drafted Myles Garrett.
Is he a quarterback?
No, he's a defensive end.
At least he probably won't go bust like a lot of picks do.
A lot of quarterbacks do do that.
What happened to their first-round pick last year?
Corey Coleman?
Yes, if he was the pick.
He broke his hand and was out for most of the season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Odell Beckham Jr?
I don't like his attitude.
I don't either.  What about as a player?
I guess it is fun to watch him play.
It is.
The one handed grab might be on the highlight reel forever.
That is what he is known for.
That and his crazy hair.
Yes, that is a little bit out there as well.
The wide receiver I like to watch is Jarvis Landry.
I have heard the name but I don't really watch Miami.
I watch them but you must have seen some of his catches.
I'm sure I have.
He is a very talented player.
There is a ton of talent in the NFL.
I guess that is why they make the big bucks.
I suppose so.
Are you planning to watch week one.
Of course.
Me too, I wouldn't miss it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the New York Jets?
They are a pretty good team.
Who is your favorite player on their current roster?
I think Matt Forte is good.
Yeah he gets a lot of yards.
I think he is talented.
Who do you think will be starting Quarterback for them?
I think Christian Hackenberg.
Well it depends if Bryce Petty is amazing in the preseason.
Yeah if he plays much better he may start.
They will be competing for sure.
Yeah it could also change throughout the season.
Hopefully whoever they choose does a good job.
Yeah I'd love to see them have a good season.
They haven't won a Superbowl since 1968.
That is a long time.
Yeah it will be 50 years if they don't win next season.
Well hopefully they make a good run.
Yeah even if they don't win they'll want some momentum for the 2018 season.
You are exactly right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
As in the NFL?
Yea, the NFL.
Fun to watch!
Indeed it is!
You watch many games?
When I get the chance to
Oh?
Yea I work a lot
What do you work
Concessions
At.. a game!?
Yea!  It's something to do!
That sounds fun!
Yea it keeps me busy and I kinda watch the games
Do you get to see a lot?
Like half of it I'd say
Not too bad
No, not really!
Good talk!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you think will have the best defense in the NFL this year?
That's tough, but I think the Seattle Seahawks will be the best defense this year.
The Legion of Boom is usually a pretty safe bet, but they were not all that good last year.
It's true that they were not as good as in years previous, but Earl Thomas was injured and should be back stronger than ever this season.
I think they will also benefit from Richard Sherman not being traded in the long run.
Yes, Sherman helps all of the guys around him be better, even when his off the field comments are a little much.
When I watched the draft, I noticed Seattle went very defense heavy. Do you think they are preparing for a run?
I think there was so much value at many defensive positions, Seattle wanted to make sure to get their piece.
Seattle drafted a great player in Malik McDowell and I'm excited to see how he plays with the Seahawks.
Well, he is joining a team that tied for third in sacks last year, so it's a pretty good squad.
It's crazy to think how so many of those sacks came after Earl Thomas was injured and Seattle had to modify its game plan.
The injury definitely hurt Seattle's plan, but they still managed to finish top five in points and yards allowed.
It sounds like Seattle is only getting better, but I'm looking forward to seeing what Wade Phillips can do with the Rams.
The Rams have some very talented players, but they are way under-utilized.
Wade is one of the greatest defensive minds of all time, so I think he will be able to draft a plan that works for the players they already have in the building.
Aaron Donald has now had a couple of years, so he will be a good player to lead the defense.
The problem is consistency for that team, they had an awful time keeping people from scoring in the redzone.
Yeah, I'm worried that might happen again this year since Phillips is switching to 3-4.
Hopefully in a 3-4, the defense will be a bit more stout, even if there are growing pains.
There isn't much to lose with the Rams defense, as they can only improve upon last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
As a New Orleans Saints fan, are you excited about Adrian Peterson?
More than excited, I'm ecstatic! I'm ready for the season to start today!
I'm really looking forward to seeing Adrian Peterson help out Drew Brees.
Mark Ingram was a capable running back for the Saints but when we talk about Adrian Peterson, that's another level in itself when it comes to a dangerous scoring threat.
Defenses will definitely have to game plan for Adrian Peterson. They won't be able to just play the Saints for the passing game like before.
In the Saints division I think they can win that division this year.
The Tampa Bay Bucs will look better with another year of experience for Jameis Winston. The Carolina Panthers will have Cam Newton healthy again and of course the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons will be there in the path!
I know it's a tough division but I think Adrian Peterson will make the difference for the Saints.
It's going to be really tough. I don't see Atlanta stepping back. They lost the Superbowl so I'm sure they're going to be really hungry to get back there to prove the lost was a fluke.
I'm not sure the Falcons have anything to be ashamed of when you lose to Tom Brady in the Superbowl.
They had a huge lead! Everyone thought it was going to be an easy win for the Atlanta Falcons.
I never thought the Patriots were out of it. They had a full half and anytime you have Tom Brady, you're never out of the game.
Okay, so the Falcons are going to be tough, and I see the Bucs giving the Saints problems next season.
That's true the Bucs always play the Saints tough. I just think they're a few years away from being a serious threat.
Now the Carolina Panthers will be back and angry to make up for an underwhelming season last year too.
I almost forgot they were just in the Superbowl a few years ago.
It was the infamous Peyton Manning Superbowl 50 farewell.
How could I forget that. The Broncos crushed the Panthers in that Superbowl.
It really seem to kill the Panthers spirit last year too.
I think Cam's nagging injuries hurt them more, but I see them bouncing back. Still, I think my Saints will be the top of the division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the Cowboy's game on TV yesterday
Man I haven't watched a football game since the last time the cowboys won the Superbowl.
You mean you live in Texas and you don't follow the NFL?
Nope, all a bunch of nonsense to me, just another way mass media tries to steal my money.
Do you have a favorite team, or did you have when you did watch.
Yeah, I was a Houston Oilers fan.
You know they don't exist now right?
Yes, just because I don't follow the NFL doesn't mean I have my head in the sand, Houston has a team called the Texans, right?
You are correct sir, what turned you against the NFL?
Think about it man, half the players are criminal rapist drug addicts, you really want to spend your Sunday, Monday, and Thursday free time watching them.
It's not that bad man, the NFL works hard to keep their players in line.
Alright, the NFL, have they ever given you anything for free to reward you as a loyal customer, and TV games don't count, because you spend at least an hour of the game watching commercials.
Yeah, I do kind of see your point.
They are there to take your money, they nickel and dime you and the taxpayers who live in the communities that have to pay for their Billion dollar stadiums.
Man you're killing me with your anti-NFL negativity.
The last good NFL player was Earl Campbel, everybody else has paled in comparison.
Well let me ask you this, who was your favorite all time NFL player when you did watch.
Roger Staubach, nobody better than him.
What would make you come back to football and start watching the games again.
When the NFL and the Teams start paying the taxpayers back for subsidizing their Billion dollar stadiums, and we know that isn't going to happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how do you think is the greatest player in NFL history?
Oh it is hard to say.
Yeah, with all the different positions.
You can go by stats, but what about performance in the clutch, etc?
Then you also have people who were on bad teams.
Barry Sanders was almost always on a bad team.
Yeah, he was basically their whole offense.
He had quarterbacks like Scott Mitchell and Rodney Peete.
I would say Jerry Rice is the greatest player in NFL history.
You can make that arguement.
His stats are so far above everyone else's for the wide receiver position.
Yeah and his work ethic was the stuff of legends.
He would run up and down a steep hill everyday in San Francisco.
He got his soft hands from catching bricks with his dad.
Yeah, I remember reading that.
I would say that Joe Montana is the greatest NFL player of all time.
He was certainty among the most clutch quarterbacks.
They didn't call him "Joe Cool" for nothing.
He went 4 and 0 in Super Bowls.
He also threw 11 touchdowns and no interceptions in Super Bowls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where was the Superbowl held this year?
It was in Houston Texas
I love Houston so I wish I went! Where was it last year?
It was in California in 2016.
Very nice! It always is in such great locations.
Well it varies and would depend on what you consider a great location...
Where is it going to be next year? Let me guess - New York, Las Vegas or Miami???
Actually it's going to be in Minnesota.
I've never been interested in going to Minnesota, so I don't think I should go.
Were you planning on actually going to the game, or you're going to sightsee.
I wouldn't have minded a bit of both.
How would you get tickets?
I guess if I decided to go, I'd just get tickets when I get there.
I wouldn't suggest that. Getting a ticket is very hard.
It probably was hard this year in Houston or last year in California, but how many people actually want to go Minnesota?
Thousands! Thousands of people will be interested in going to Superbowl no matter what city it is in.
I guess maybe die-hard fans would be interested even if it's not an exotic city.
Exactly.
Who will be playing next year?
No way of telling yet. We will only have a better idea once the season is well underway.

The Seahawks may just not have it anymore.
You think? They still have some great players.
I agree, but they are getting older too.
Yea, they are, but they are still talented.
Yea, but eventually age usually catches up to you.
Yea, it might start to catch up to them, but Russell Wilson is still young.
You're right. He is very young, but he could ware down as well with the way that he plays.
Yea, he plays hard and he is fearless. Thats for sure.
How many other quarterbacks can you think of like him?
I don't know. Theres a couple. Marcus Mariota comes to mind first.
Yea, he could be one of them. Rodgers may be another one, but he doesn't run as much.
Yea, those are two good choices. Griffin was, but I do not know what to even consider him anymore.
There are always a few speedy quarterbacks, but the pocket passers tend to succeed more.
Yea, it does seem like that. They are able to stay healthier and be more productive.
Yea, health definitely helps.
Yea, it has for Brady. That is for sure.
Yea, it has helped them win multiple superbowls.
I agree! Health goes a long way.
Yea, it definitely has for the Patriots.
Yea, we will see how they fare this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the Green Bay Packers
Why do you like that team
My husband likes that team and I follow the team with him
Have you ever been to a game
We have been to Lambeau Field 2 times
That sounds like a lot of fun but cold
The first game was freezing but we were prepared. We wore feet warmers and heavy gear
Good thinking. I would love to go to a game
It is well worth the time and expense. It is a great experience
I think I will look into it
Its always good to go with a group of friends
I have a group of friends that like the same team so that should be no problem
I would recommend paying extra for parking near the field
Thanks for telling me that. I would never have thought of that
You might have to get a hotel room about a half hour  away. Appleton is a good place.
wow that is good advice
You should also give yourself time to visit all the fun things in the area
Sounds like an extra day or 2 would be worth it
I hope you have a great time
Thanks I will tell you all about it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay this is really weird to me. I was reading some facts about the NFL and this caught my eye.
What could be so weird?
The Pittsburgh Steelers' first-ever draft pick was William Shakespeare.
Yes that is strange. Maybe there is a conspiracy with the Ravens since they were named for Edgar Allen Poe.
You mean with famous writers of yore as inspiration.
This is something i bet most people don't know about the Cowboys. Cowboys.com became a male dating website after Cowboys owner Jerry Jones balked at paying $275,000 for the domain in 2007.
There are couple of interesting things to do with music and the NFL.
What are they?
"The Super Bowl Shuffle" was nominated for a Grammy in 1987. Whitney Houston's rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" from Super Bowl XXV is the only version of the national anthem to reach the Top 20 on the U.S. charts.
Whitney I can understand but the Super Bowl Shuffle song! Come on!
Oh it get's better. Detroit Lions' second-year kicker Havard Rugland, a native of Norway, credits Wu-Tang Clan for his mastery of the English language.
Unbelievable! But hilarious!
Here are some crazy Super Bowl stuff. he first famous Super Bowl commercial was in 1974. It was an ad for Noxzema, featuring quarterback Joe Namath. The commercial in question included former Miss Sweden.
Oh yes I remember  that on too!
This one is just too hard to believe. No network footage exists of Super Bowl I. It was reportedly taped over (for a soap opera, according to some rumors).
Oh man do you know what that would be worth if it actually existed?
Oh here's another music related fact for NFL fans.All My Rowdy Friends Are Here on Monday Night by Hank Williams Jr. debuted as the Monday Night Football theme in 1989.
Yes that was a catchy tune.
Terry Bradshaw is the first and only NFL player to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
He is one zany guy! I like him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the upcoming NFL season!
Why?  So many games are going to be played in London.  We won't get to see a lot.
It'll still be on TV and that just means better crowds when the games are played in the US.`
I hope the Jaguars finally do well - new coach, new players, great draft pick!
if not I bet they'll be the first US team to sign full time in London!
What about CA moving to Las Vegas and the new CA stadium?!
Yeah tons of new changes in the next few years.
The new female Ref should be good, too.
hopefully she makes the right calls and people don't focus on her being a woman rather than a ref
yeah she'll have to go through the same issues like the female reporters I guess.
who will be the breakout star?
Tom Brady as usual, maybe Eli Manning?
I think there's a lot of new blood this year a whole new game!
are you going to do fantasy football?
I will!  you?
I am going to sit this season out because I don't know enough about the new dudes.
yeah  I mean focus on NCAA, too
Yeah I do love the SEC, too but not as much as NFL.
Well the Jags have that large screen and pool area so I might go to the game just for that!
yeah lets get tickets regardless of who is playing
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite NFL quarterback?
Do you mean a quarterback who is currently playing or just any quarterback in history?
I mean someone who is currently playing in the league presently.
I would probably say Aaron Rodgers of the the Packers.
You're a big Green Bay Packers fan then?
Not really, I don't dislike them but I'm more a fan of individual players than teams.
Are you a Tom Brady fan at all?
I respect his athletic ability and it's hard to deny that he's one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time but I'm not a big fan of his.
Personally I'm the opposite. I'm more a fan of teams than individual players.
So what teams do you like to root for?
I'm a massive Dallas Cowboys fan and have been my entire life.
That's got to be tough, they are disappointing every year.
Yeah, it's one thing just to be a bad team but they always come so close to being great but always seem to fall short in the playoffs.
At least they have one of the nicest stadiums in the NFL so there's that.
Yeah AT&T Stadium is really awesome. It cost over a billion dollars to build so it should be.
Who is the Dallas Cowboys' starting QB this year?
Looks like it's going to be Dak Prescott this year.
I hope for your sake that he works out. It's been a long time since Dallas has had a truly great quartback.
They've had some good ones but Troy Aikman so many years ago was the last superstar quarterback for them.
It's going to be a fun game when the Cowboys play the Packers this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Are you excited about football season this year?
I am.  I can't wait to root for the Bengals.
Do you really think they will even be decent this year?
I hope so. It isn't much fun rooting for a losing team.
Maybe they will bounce back and be in the playoffs this time.  Third in their division wasn't terrible, but wasn't great either.
I know! I hated watching them lose so much.  How do you think the Panthers will do?
I am excited for the Panthers this year.  I think they will be fun to watch.
Do you get to go to any games this season?
Actually, I think I do!  I am actually off a couple of weekends they play at home.
That is great! I wish I lived closer to Cincinnati, then I could actually see the Bengals play in person.
If they were playing the Panthers this year I would say come with me, but they aren't.
Thanks for the offer, but you are right.  The schedule just isn't on my side this year.
Lets hope the schedule is one their side and they play better than last year.
Now that is funny.
Of course, we could say the same thing about the Panthers.  They weren't so hot last season either.
True, but I think they are due. I really do.
Did they get some awesome drafts picks or something?
They got a few prospects and a few promising trades too.
Well, I guess we both can keep our fingers crossed for better seasons.
I think I will be crossing my toes too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When you pick a team to root for, is it based on whether or not you think they can win?
What sort of team?
An NFL team. Isn't it football season?
It did just start.
Right, so how do you pick a team to root for?
I guess I never really picked. I'm from Wisconsin so I like the Packers.
So it's just where you grew up?
I think that's how it is for most people.
Huh. I mean, I grew up in Oregon, but I'm not like a huge Seahawks fan or anything.
Was that the closest team.
I think so? I've never drawn out a map or anything.
So what teams do you like then?
I like the Oakland Raiders. They seem like underdogs.
So in your case it's the opposite then.
Opposite of what?
You root for the team you think is less likely to win.
Oh, yeah. I guess I do that.
Why?
I think it just makes it more exciting.
You're a little strange, but I think I understand it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is Gronkowski playing for?
I don't remember.
Is it the team with the tiger mascot?
You mean the Bengals?
I think that might be it.
I thought he trained with the Rams.
I get him mixed up with Gostkowski.
Gostkowski is a kicker.
Right, what position does Gronkowski play?
Linebacker, if I remember right.
I thought he was a tight end?
He played as quarterback in college.
Which college was that?
Notre Dame.
They did really well last year.
Not as good as North Carolina.
Whose the NC coach?
I don't keep track of college football too closely.
Hodgekins came from NC.
He's a great runningback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the practice footage for the upcoming game?
I already bought more sports channels.
Dude, why are you always hating on Manning?
Do you think he'll get in the Hall of Fame this year.
EJ is playing with some real vets.
I absolutely agree. How long is Manning out?
I think he's coming back for the 5th game.
Brady is not too far down on that list.
Did he talk about his injuries at all?
He only mentioned his workout routine.
So, Smith didn't press him.
How long as their current coach been in Chicago.
He's young enough to bounce back on another team.
Geno may get less now, but he's on a better team.
All of the NFL is quick to get rid of coaches.
I didn't even know their contracts were up.
Cam Newton stood out more to me than Roethlisberger ever did.
Fantasy football doesn't win Superbowls. Players would kill to get a ring.
If he keeps starting he'll be noticeable enough for future drafts.
Exactly, if he got drafted I can see him excelling past Brady.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Roger Gidell is doing a good job?
No, I think he's pretty bad
He doesn't deal with any of the major issues of the NFL
Like concussions and cheating and money and crime?
Yes. He skirts them all
Do you think they need a new commisioner?
Yes. The NFL makes so much money and the players and fans get very little from it
They definitely shouldn't get tax breaks for stadiums
And the players should all get better pensions and medical care
They destroy their bodies for our entertainment
The least we can do is pay them a decent wage
I also really liked that Colin Kapernick stood up for black lives matter
Me too.
It was dissapointing how upset people got about that
I agree
His teammates seemed to stand by him.
His coach could have done more
The whole NFL could have done more
I'm glad he stood up for that though at least.
Yeah. It starts with one person
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any thoughtse on how you think the 49ers will do this year?
Well, they couldn't do much worse than last year.
Last year was terrible.
I know. Only two wins and fourteen losses.
Who did they beat?
Both times they won against the Rams.
The Rams must be a really bad team.
Actually, they had more wins last season than the 49ers did.
Maybe they need to get a new coach.
They did get a new one for this year.
Who is it?
His name is Kyle Shanahan.
Well, maybe he can turn the team around.
I hope so. It's not even that fun watching them anymore.
I know. I mean what's the point of watching if you know they're going to lose?
I'm going to give this season a chance and see if the new coach makes a difference.
I'll check out the first couple of games, too.
It would be great if they get back to being the winning type of team they used to be.
Well it won't be long until we find out.
So we should watch the first game together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the greatest coach in NFL history?
I would say Bill Bellichek. He constantly wins in the free agent era.
Bellichek is great, but what about Noll, Walsh, Lombardi?
Maybe it would be more appropriate to look at each era.
Who's the greatest coach in the 60's?
Of course, Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls and had a dominant Packers team for many years.
How about the 70's?
You'd have to go with Chuck Noll.  Winning four Super Bowls in 10 years is awesome.  He helped put the team together with shrewd drafting.
How about the 80's?
No doubt - Bill Walsh.  The man was a genius.  He built the 49er's from the ground up and he drafted two hall of fame quarterbacks, Montana and Young.  He also drafted the greatest wide receiver in jerry Rice.
How about the 90's?
I'd say Jimmy Johnson even though his Cowboys time was short lived.  He built that team from the ground up and they dominated for so many years because of the way he drafted.
Who's the most underrated coach in history?
That's a tie between Bud Grant and Marv Levy.
I agree, they both made it to 4 Super Bowls but didn't win any.
If they would have won even one Super Bowl, their legacy would be so much different.
Yeah Levy made the Super bowl three years in a row and lost them all.
Bud coached the Vikings during the 70's and 80's, they had one of the greatest defenses in history - the Purple People Eaters!
Come on man! No one even compares with the Steel Curtain / Pittsburgh Steelers defense in the 70's!
What about the 85 Bears defense?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who is the greatest quarterback of all time?
I know you want me to say Joe Montana.
Why is that?
Because you know I'm a 49er fan, and you want to disprove his greatness.
I'm not that mean, but he was rather slow with an average arm--what's so great about that?
Four Super Bowl Wins, no losses, MVP three times.
Well, mediocre quarterbacks have won the Super Bowl and the winning quarterback is usually the MVP.
Montana could read the defense, throw with deadly accuracy to an open receiver, and lead that receiver into long gains after the catch.
O.K. the guy was pretty good.  Would you consider anyone else?
Well, Dan Marino probably was the best passer.
Yeah, for an immobile guy to just stand there and throw for that many yard is pretty impressive.  How about Joe Namath?
Are you trying to sucker me?  Joe Namath's win in Super Bowl III changed the history of professional football, but he only threw for about 200 yards in that game.
Well, the game was different then--not the big passing yardage, but Namath good, but not the greatest.
I guess I have to consider Tom Brady.
You think.  Seven Super Bowl appearances.
I thought the Super Bowl was not a necessary criterion.
O.K, but seven?
He lost two.
I guess you're never going to back down from Joe Montana.
Well, there's Steve Young.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you thin Tampa Bay will do this year?
About where they are right now, 9-7
Famous Jameis Winston is good though
Not that good...
What do you mean
QBR rating of 65 last year
So he had too many interceptions?
Yup...18 of them
Didn't know he had that many
And a lot of them were bad one too
Think Brent Grimes is any good
Yup, in spite of his wife
Yeah but leave her out of it...lol
Yeah he got ran out of Miami because of her
Well he came back with Tampa last year
Running game needs some help too
Zeke ran for more than the whole team last year.
Didn't know that...wow that's bad
Real bad...don't see it getting any better either
Can't get any worse
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish each state had an NFL team.
Why?
Because it's not fair that some states have multiple teams, while some have zero teams.
I don't think it matters.
Would you feel sad if your state didn't have at least one NFL team?
Well,, yeah.
So, I'm sure there are plenty of people in plenty of states who wish they had one.
I guess it would be cool to have more teams.
More teams, more players, more games.
The playoffs would be so ridiculous.
I'm glad your're beginning to see things my way.
Do you think this would be possible?
sure, first we take states that have multiple teams and we give them to a different state.
And then what?
And then we just make a few football teams each year until we have 50.
I think this could all get pretty messy.
Just because it could potentially be messy doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth it.
That's true, it just seems like it would be a lot of work.
I guess we should just be happy our states have NFL teams.
Now you're talking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the best quarterbacks in the NFL going into this 2017 season?
There are a lot of great ones but most people think that Tom Brady , Matt Ryan and Aaron Rogers are among the best.
I thought Tom Brady was getting too old to play ?
True he will be 40 years old this year but he is still considered one of the best if not the best in the NFL
What makes him so great
Basically he  is one of the most accurate passers in the NFL.
How do you think he stays so great
From what I read it is his work ethic and committment to the team and football
What about Aaron Rodgers.
He has room for improvement.
What happened last season with his game.
Basically most people would agree he might have been too aggressive in his attempts to function on the outside of the offense.
Did he get better as the season went on
Yes, he started making much better plays from the pocket.
What did that result in
it really reduces the potential for turnovers. He also greatly increased his long throws.
What about Matt Ryan
He is with the Atlanta Falcolns and
What are his basica strengths and positives
He has excellent throwing ability and even led the league in long throws for a while.  He had some bad interception luck but overall is as good as the other top quarterbacks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XXII.
Who played in that one?
The Redskins against Denver.
Who were the quarterbacks?
John Elway for Denver and Doug Williams.
Who were the coaches?
Joe Gibbs for the Redskins and Dan Reeves for the Broncos.
Where did they play?
San Diego.
Who scored first?
Denver, 10-0 after one.
How about the half?
Washington scored 35 unanswered points to lead 35-10.
Who played at halftime?
Chubby Checker and the Rockettes.
Cool. What happened in the third quarter?
No scoring.
What was the final score?
42-10.
Poor Elway, another SB loss.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, which team is your favorite NFL team?
The Seattle Seahawks.  I have been a fan since childhood.
Do you think the Seahawks can win the Super Bowl this year?
I definitely think they can if they stay healthy.
My favorite team is the Patriots.
Yuck, I hate the Patriots.
I know, lots of people do, but I love that they are always good.
Yeah, I guess.  How long do you think Tom Brady can continue to play at a high level?
Well, he's nearly 40, but I think he may have 5 years left.
Wow, that would really be impressive to play to 45.
Do you think Russell Wilson will have a good year?
Absolutely.  I read he changed his diet this offseason in an effort to remain healthier than last year.
Excellent.  He did have several injuries he played through last year.
Yeah, hip, knee, and chest injuries.
Though I think that losing Earl Thomas was a worse situation for Seattle last year.
I know, the defense was just terrible after he went down with that broken leg.
If he's healthy though, that Defense should still be pretty darn good.
As long as the depth players we brought in from the outside perform, we should be a top 5 defense.
Well, good luck to your Seahawks this year.
Same to you and your Patriots.  Later man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the Minnesota Vikings.
Vikings sounds like a tough name.
They are based in Minneapolis.
They were established in 1960.
That's 57 years ago.
They play in U.S. Bank Stadium.
They used to be part of the Western conference.
Then they were part of the central division.
In 1970 they were in the NFC Central.
Now they are in the NFC north.
Their uniform is white and purple.
Sometimes it is Gold and purple.
Zygi Wilf is the owner.
He was born in Germany.
Mark Wilf is the president.
Rick Speilman is the General manager.
Mike Zimmer is the head coach.
He used to be defensive coordinator for other teams.
A good nick name is the Vikes.
They have 28 playoff appearances.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe the start of the NFL season is just about 2 months away know?
It's crazy. I feel like the Patriots were just beating the Falcons in overtime in the Superbowl.
Don't remind me. I am still angry about them beating the Steelers in the AFC championship game.
How do you think the Steelers will do this year?
I am hoping for the best. As long as we can stay healthy I think we have a chance.
Adding James Connor to add depth at running back was a good move during the draft.
Definitely. We are solid on offense with Ben, Bell, Brown, Connor, and hopefully Bryant will be back to himself.
So glad Ben decided to come back this year and not retire.
I didn't believe he would actually retire.
What do you think about the defense?
James Harrison will always be solid, even if he is 40. The rest of the defense needs to step up and prove themselves.
I think they made good moves in free agency to sure up the defense.
Lets hope. Are you planning on going to any games this year?
I have tickets to the home game against the Packers. I might go to one of the Thursday night games as well.
Sweet, I'm hoping to make it to a couple as well.
Their really is nothing like the experience of a home Steeler's game at Heinz field.
For sure. Got to have the terrible towel.
There are also so many restaurants around the stadium now that game days are now an all day event.
Well let's hope for 16-0.
Either way, I think we have 2 guaranteed wins against the Browns.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, football season is comming up.
I know.  OTA's are starting.  Who's your team?
I like the Broncos.
Aw man, Im a radiers fan haha.  Looks like we have to hate each other now!
Right?  I'm not that big of a fan since Peyton retired.
Yea, he was good.  Im glad Carr is gonna be healthy all year.
He's good.  If he didnt get knocked out in the playoffs last year, I think the Radiers had a shot at the Super Bowl.
I think so too.  Be those freaking Patriots again.
I know.  I wanted Atlanta to win so bad.
They had it too, man.  They were up so much at the half.
Im telling you, man.....I think the NFL is rigged.
I think so too.  Goodell is crooked.
No one likes him.  You think he would know and stop all his BS
Yea.  He hasnt done a good job.
So you think Lynch is gonna be just like old Beast Mode again?
I hope so!  He retired young, so he can still be good.
What about AP?  You think he'll be a big back again?
Which Brees at QB, he'll get a lot of looks.  He might get 2000 yards again.
Who do you think will take it this year?
Raiders, baby!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Besides the Patriots, who do you think wins the AFC?
I think the Broncos have a great chance.
I'm worried about their quarterback.
With their defense, as long as their QB doesn't make mistakes they will be good.
Who do you think wins the QB job in Denver?
I think Lynch will win it. He's got more talent.
I also like Jamal Charles.
Wasn't he hurt most of last year?
Yeah, but he can come back in a as a spot starter and be solid.  He adds a speed dimension to that offense.
Agree, but the Chiefs are still in their division. They are going to be tough.
Agree and love their defense, but you can't win with Alex Smith.
Alex Smith is decent, but he's not a game changer.
What about the Ravens?
Forgot about them, they have a decent defense and love Flacco.
Flacco is an underrated QB.
Agree, for a guy who's won a Super Bowl and played in big time games - he doesn't get the respect he deserves
Of course, none of this matters because the Patriots will win it all this year.
I'm seriously thinking they will go undefeated.
If they do, they will be know as the greatest franchise in NFL history!
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, are you getting excited for the new season?
Well, kinda. I'm not too sure about how the Seahawks are going to do though.
Oh, are the Seahawks your favorite team?
Yeah. I always watched them growing up.
Well, why are you worried about how they're going to do?
Their draft class looks kind of weak, and Russel Wilson isn't getting any younger.
Yeah, he really got banged up last year.
I know. He's the most mobile quarterback in the league so of course they turned him into a pocket passer.
Why did they do that? He was in good shape before he got hurt, wasn't he?
Yeah, he was doing great in the preseason, but for some reason they decided he'd stand behind his awful line and wait to get tackled.
Oh man, don't even bring up the Seattle offensive line. They were just awful.
Well, what do you expect, the lowest paid line in the league, for a good reason.
Well, did they at least draft anybody to shore up the line for next season?
Ethan Pocic is supposed to be a good offensive lineman, but I don't know, I don't watch college ball.
Well, I read an interview where the Seahawks were really eager to get Pocic, maybe he's good.
I sure hope so, otherwise it's going to be sack city again.
It doesn't have to be, if they just let Russel Wilson move with the ball.
Yeah, he's definitely still the most mobile QB in the league, but he's too short to just stand in the pocket.
Well, I hope they do well, I always liked the Seahawks too.
Me too. Maybe we should see if we can get some tickets and see a home game?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oi my man
Ello
Going to the bar tonight
Thinking I might
Why only thinking
Because not sure yet
You can't miss out
Why not
Uh why else
Why?
You don't keep track of dates do you
Not to much
I can tell
Why
The first of the season games start tonight
Oh man it does
Yeah it does
I totally forgot
I can tell it's cool
I will be there
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I am so excited about the upcoming season for the Chiefs. How about you?
Absolutely, they did great last year.
I know, I would love to see them in the playoffs again this year.
Me too, but they never seem to win playoff games.
Yeah, but Andy Reid has been great for the team and I think they are headed in the right direction.
I agree, I am just concerned about some of the players we lost in the off season.
That is concerning, but I am thinking that they will get some great players.
I hope so I would love to see them with a winning record and with a trip to the playoffs.
I think we should try to go to some games this year.
Absolutely, I hope they are playing the Detroit Lions this year I would love to see that game.
Me too, last time they played it was in London.
I know I was bummed I couldn't go.
I don't think they play them this year, because they are different divisions it only happens every 3-4 years.
That is a bummer.
I can't wait to go see them play anytime!
I love Arrowhead Stadium, it is the loudest in the NFL and it is an amazing experience.
I love it too, it gets my blood pumping just walking in there.
I think we should wait and go in November or December, it will give them time to find their groove.
I agree, let's do it.
Maybe they will play on Thanksgiving, that would be a fun game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi are you a fan of NFL football?
Yes I am!
That is great, what is your favorite team?
My favorite team is the Detroit Lions.
That is awesome.  I hear a lot of great things about Matthew Stafford.
Yes he is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
What is the most impressive stat of his to you?
He was the fastest player in NFL history to reach 30,000 passing yards.
That is an incredible stat.  Are there any other stats of his that interest you?
Well he is known for his comeback victories.  In fact, he hold the record with 8 comeback wins in one season.
Wow that is very cool.  I love the excitement during comeback wins.
I agree but it is very hard being a fan and witnessing all of these close games.
I would still prefer that over a blowout.  Blowout's are boring.
I would always prefer an exciting game.  That is why I am glad that the NFL is focused more on passing now.
I get that but I also feel that the solid 4 yard runs are a classic part of a good offense.
That is true but it just not as exciting to watch.
I just love watching to NFL in general no matter what style of game it is.
My sunday's are filled with NFL football and good food.
Sounds about like me.  There is just nothing better than Sunday's during the NFL season.
Sunday's during NFL season really are the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Dak Prescott is for real?
What reason do I have to think otherwise?
The fact that he had all those guys behind him.
Like who?
Dez and Zeke for starters.
I still think they could have been made better by Dak
Well the sophmore year can be the most telling
Do you think he does dip?
His numbers were pretty good
its hard to repeat them
what about elliot
he is sure to have a come down year
yeah its not sustainable what he does and did
Yeah running backs cant run like that
i agree with you on that one
I dont know though, its tough to tell with the elite ones
Look what happened to Todd Gurley
Yeah hes a great example
And you saw what drop Shaun Alexander had
I forgot about him for a minute
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you have winning the Super Bowl this year?
It's still too early to tell. Obviously the Pats are favorites to win it all.
I put money down on the Bengals. Vegas is giving them 66-to-1 odds to win it.
No way do the Bengals win the Super Bowl this year.
Sure, it's a long shot, but I like they're team.
Who did they get in the draft?
they got John Ross out of Washington with the 9th pick.
Oh he's really dynamic. Fastest guy in the draft I heard.
He'll open thinks up for that offense. With AJ Green and Tyler Eiffert on the other ends Dalton should be able to throw at will.
They do have a really good receiving corps and Dalton has proven to be a good QB and leader.
Plus their running game is among the best in the league
But their defense isn't strong enough, and defense is what wins championships.
I think you need a good defense nowadays but an elite QB if you want to win it all.
And Dalton isn't elite.
He's been borderline elite for a season or two. He's capable of putting up an elite season this year.
I can name 10 other quarterbacks I'd rather have over Andy Dalton.
The point of the bet was that Dalton could potentially have an elite season, and if he does the Bengals win it all
I would have rather put my money on a safer pick like the Packers or Steelers
But if the Bengals win, I look like a genius and I win a lot of money.
I think they've made improvements and should be better, but nobody from the AFC is beating the Patriots to get to the Super Bowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Pats are going to the Superbowl again this year?
I certainly hope not, I am so sick of them.
So am I , all their cheating.
I would really like to see a team be in the Superbowl that have never been there
Well, I would like to see the Packers in it.
So would I, but if not them, then maybe the Lions.
Yeah, I don't think they have ever been in the Superbowl.
No they haven't, neither have the Browns, Jaquars, or Texans
So it looks like the Lions are the only NFC team that has never played in the Superbowl
Yup, all the others are in the AFC
Who would you want in the Superbowl half time show
I don't know, I think Train would be cool
Ok, I like Five for Fighting or Sugar Ray
Yeah, they would be good also
Well, who do you like is going to come on top in the NFC North
I think it's going to be Packers, Vikings, Lions and Bears
LOL, I always want to say, "Oh My" after that.
LOL, I do too.
I think that the Packers will be in second place for awhile and then come out on top at the last minute.
Isn't that what they always seem to do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the Dallas Cowboys.
When they were big they had their own board game.
They are a professional American football team.
Yes, based in Dallas-Ft. Worth.
They compete in the NFL.
I think in the National Football Conference.
Yes, in the East Division.
They joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960.
They have the record of the most consecutive sell outs.
Yes, 190 consecutive sold out regular and post season games home and away began in 2002.
They have been to the Super Bowl 8 times.
They won 5 Super Bowls.
They had 20 consecutive winning seasons when they missed the play offs twice.
In 2015 they were valued at $4 billion.
Forbes figured that out.
That would make them the most valuable sports team in the world.
They need to win another Super Bowl.
Its about time.
Their revenue in 2014 was $620 million.
That's a lot of money.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XII.
Who played in that one?
Dallas versus Denver.
Didn't their defenses have colorful names?
Dallas had the Doomsday Defense and Denver had the Orange Crush.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Roger Staubach for Dallas and Craig Morton for Denver.
What was the score after the first quarter?
10-0, Dallas.
And at the half?
13-0, Dallas.
How was the halftime show?
Pretty lame - Tyler Junior College and Al Hirt.
How was the scoring in the third quarter?
Denver scored 10 and Dallas scored 7.
How was the fourth quarter?
Dallas scored a touchdown, and Denver did not score.
Who was the MVP?
They chose two - Randy White and Harvey Martin.
Too bad about Denver.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo
Hey
What's good
Nothing much
Same pretty much
Pretty much?
Playing some video games
Like what
Madden NFL
Having fun?
Nah
Why not
Getting beat badly
By who
The Bengals
How so
I am down by 10
What quarter?
Last one
Well sorry for your loss
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Ray Lewis from the Baltimore Ravens?
He is one of my favorite players of all time.
Why do you like him?
I love his intensity.
What about his off the field issues?
I've watched a few things about him and I think he was innocent.
Ray seems like a crazy guy.
No, he's really a humble person off the field.
What about on the field?
He's a maniac all about destroying the other team.
I never really like him.  I always thought he was overrated.
He was one of the best players in the league!  How can you call him overrated?
I thought that defense had so much talent that it just made him look better.
You could have put Ray Lewis on the Cleveland Browns and he would have been dominate.
Well Ray Lewis only won 2 Super Bowls.
He won 2 Super Bowls with average quarterbacks.
Joe Flacco was a good quarterback.
What about Trent Dilfer?
I guess that is a good point. Trent Dilfer wasn't a good quarterback.
Yeah Dilfer wasn't good but Ray Lewis and that defense still won a Super Bowl with him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who will have the best defense in the NFL next season?
Well, you have to start with the best defense in the league last year.
Which team is that?
The Houston Texans were the best last year.
Really?    They were better than the Arizona Cardinals?
The Cardinals were close, but ranked second.
I thought J.J. Watt being out would've hurt the Texans more.
I agree, but the rise of Jedaveon Clowney helped out quite a lot.
Right, but the pass rush still wasn't as strong, right?
Well, Clowney and Whitney Mercilus did a good job together.
OK, I can see that    Is Watt healthy?
He has been working in the preseason workouts.
Well, add the best defensive player in the league to the best defense.
Yes, if everyone is healthy, it will be almost impossible to score on the Texans.
Didn't they change up some things on the coaching staff?
Yes.     Romeo Crennel was promoted.
Will that hurt the defense.
Not really, Crennel is still present, and the new coordinator has been with the franchise.
What's the name of the new Defensive Coordinator?
He is Mike Vrabel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's up, man? You ready for this new football season?
I literally can't wait.
I know. It's been hard going without football for so long.
Tell me about it.
You know my Patriots have it this year, right?
Yeah, they looked good this offseason.
How do the 'Boys look?
I think we're your biggest competition.
Man, you know good and well, Brady would pick them apart.
We'll see, we'll see.
You know who else looks great this year?
Who?
NOT the Panthers!
Oh, man, that's cold. You know that's my second team!
I know. I'm just teasing you though, man.
I think Cam is going to be passing more this season. We'll see what happens.
Where do you want to watch the first game?
I'm not sure. Let me think about it.
Alrighty, that sounds good. Preseason will be here soon enough!
Oh, yeah. Ready to get some football in my life in some sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Getting excited about NFL football camps opening soon?
Absolutely. I plan to get to the Green Bay Packer camp in Depere, Wisconsin next month.
I am guessing you a Packer fan?
Yep, I bleed green & gold.
Are you planning on seeing any regular season games this year.
Yes, my buddy and I are going to the December 3rd game in Tampa.
How long have you been a Packer fan.
Since 1950.
Have you been to any Superbowl games the packers played in?
Yes, I was lucky enough to see Superbowl XXXI in New Orleans.
What team is the biggest Packer rival?
Has always been the Bears but, the Vikings are moving up.
Do you have a favorite player from the Packer past?
Yes, that would have to be Bart Starr for me.
How closely do you follow the NFL during the season?
I watch a couple games each week and if the Packers are on, I never miss it.
Who is your favorite current Packer?
That would be Aaron Rodgers as he is an amazing quarterback.
How are the Packers going to do this year.
I can see them at 12-4 with some luck and few injuries. If Rodgers goes down, we are in major trouble.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will have great season in the NFL this year?
I think the Packers, Patriots, and Rams will have good years.
You think the Rams will be decent?
Yes, they have a new location and a decent QB now.
Their QB is unproven, but we will see.
I also think the Bengals has a shot.
That sounds iffy, too. Why do you think this?
Their defense has always been stout.
They also have a good home field advantage in the cold.
Yes they do, as do the Packers.
I think Aaron Rogers will win MVP.
We will see, I think Brady has a shot.
Brady has won it too many times!
But that is because he is so great!
Yes, he has definitely deserved them.
We will see I guess - anything is possible with Belichick.
I think the Raiders will be interesting this year.
Yeah they lost their QB at the wrong moment last year.
Hopefully he's healed up and ready to go.
I think he will be, but we will see. Go Raiders!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What conference are the Cardinals in?
The NFC
Did they have Kurt Warner?
Yes, he was their QB for awhile.
Cool
Yeah, he was really good.
Didn't Warner used to play for the Rams?
Yes he did
Did they go to the Super Bowl?
Yes
Did they win?
I think they did
Warner won the MVP,so I was just wondering
He is one of the best ever
Who is another good QB?
Joe Montana
What about a current one?
Tom Brady
Has he won the Super Bowl before?
Yes a few times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Steelers last year.
I thought they played well.
Yes they are a great ball club.
How do you like their running game.
Le'Veon Bell is a superstar.
Yes he does amazing things.
Yes the way he moves is so fun to watch.
Yes it is very entertaining to watch.
I liked what he did in the playoffs.
Yes he really stepped up.
He is so powerful too.
He is the total package.
Yes he is so strong, yet so quick and fast.
He really shows what the human body is capable of.
Yes he lays it on the line every run.
He goes super hard.
Yes he is a powerful runner.
He can catch the ball too.
Yes he can do it all.
He is fun to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts about the Arizona Cardinals?
I think they have some great young players, perhaps not enough for a superbowl run
Carson Palmer is getting up there in age so I can see that.
Not only Palmer, but Larry Fitzgerald is on the fence of retirement also.
One guy I do like is David Johnson.
Yeah he is a good young RB.
He was a steal in the draft, he was what a 3rd or 4th round pick?
I am not sure but I think you are close if not correct.
He has been dominating the past few seasons.
Yeah he has a legit MVP shot this year if he can stay healthy
Health and the fact if the Cardinals can keep up the pass game to keep the pressure off.
Everyone knows Johnson is going to get his touches so keeping the safetys deep is crucial
Is there anyone else that sticks out to you on the Cardinals?
I really like LB Deone Bucannon.
You mean the Safety that converted to Linebacker
Yeah, it was a great move. His speed and coverage skills are awesome for a LB
Only downside is that he is undersized, he is still in the same weight as he was at Safety
That is true but he makes up for it in speed.
So David Johnson and Deone Bucannon. The future of the Cardinals perhaps?
Those two are a good group to build around that is for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow the NFL at all?
Yeah, definitely. I love football.
What's your favorite team?
I would have to say the Patriots, but I have a few that I like.
Really? I don't like the Patriots at all.
What's your favorite team, then?
I'm a huge fan of the Bears.
That's cool. The Bears might actually do well next year.
I think so too. I'm excited for the changes they've made.
It will definitely be interesting to see. I still think Tom Brady has them beat, though.
I expected you'd say that. Do you think he really played a part in the deflated football scandal?
I'm really not sure how I feel about that situation.
I think he at least had knowledge that the balls were deflated during that game.
Yeah, I just think it's blown out of proportion.
That's true. It seemed like a really big deal for a deflated football.
Definitely. No one can say that Tom Brady's success is solely due to cheating.
I'll agree with you there. He's got talent and that's easy to see.
The last Super Bowl was a pure showcase of his ability to perform under pressure.
That was the biggest comeback I have ever seen.
I couldn't believe my eyes. They did exactly what they had to in order to win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the game last night?
Yeah, it was crazy. I can't believe they pulled back from that score!
At first I thought it was over for the Eagles.
Yeah but then Carson Wentz started playing really well.
I don't know about that. I thought the offensive line just held well.
But without the passes from Wentz, they would have never scored a touchdown.
I guess that's fair, but I don't think Wentz has been playing too well recently.
He won them the last game didn't he?
Yeah but that was one good game out of the last couple. Recently he's been playing poorly.
I think he has been playing alight. I mean the Eagles are winning aren't they?
Yeah I guess a win is a win. So I won't complain.
I'm definitely not complaining about the winning after last season.
Definitely. Last season was rough.
I cant believe that we went 7-9-0.
To think that in the early 2000s the Eagles were making it to conference championships and now we have a negative record.
Yeah it's a rough time to be an Eagles fan.
Well at least we aren't doing too bad this season. What is our record right now?
The Eagles are 4-3-0 right now.
Hey that's actually pretty good.
I'll take it. At least we have a winning record.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL is?
I think it's Aaron Rodgers, but I think Tom Brady and his superbowl wins also enter the conversation.
Aaron Rodgers is so talented, but it's hard to deny the handful of rings that Tom has.
I do think superbowl rings matter, but based on pure stats, Aaron Rodgers is unlike anyone who has played the game.
I just think his argument would be stronger with more than one superbowl win.
Yeah, Mike McCarthy needs to get Rodgers another ring or two and then maybe the haters will be a little less quick to judge him.
Even though I think Tom might be my pick for the best, he cannot do most of the things Aaron does.
Tom is definately not quick on his feet.
Of course he isn't, he is several years older than Aaron and never was much of a runner in the first place.
That's why the Bill is a genius, he always plays to Tom's strengths.
McCarthy could take a page or two out of his book with Aaron.
Mike McCarthy relies too much on Aaron's athleticism and not enough on game plan.
Yeah, Aaron has had a lot of close calls that could've been rings if his team was better.
Every year, Aaron puts out a crazy amount of effort, only for them to lose in crazy championship games!
His hail mary in that Arizona playoff game made jump out of my chair in disbelief.
It was kind of like that Rodgers to Rodgers one in Detroit, but with a little more on the line.
Wasn't that Detroit hail mary for the division title though or seeding purposes?
It was. We ended up improving our record and seeding, but then lost to  Arizona that year in the playoffs.
With Aaron Rodgers though, the Packers are never really out of the running, but I could say the same about Tom.
I think that's partially true, although plug another quarterback in for Tom in that system and I think the Patriots will still be successful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Cowboy's chances this year?
I think they are turing the corner.
Yes, Dak Prescott has changed this time.
Yes he's much better than Romo.
Oh Romo wasn't bad, but he ain't a world beater.
Romo wasn't bad?
Hey even Trent Dilfer won a Super Bowl.
Well, I suppose you're right.
But Dak Prescott is much better.
Elliott is a beast too.
Where did Prescott go to college?
Somewhere in the SEC i think.
Was it Arkansas?
No, I think it was Mississippi St.
Ah yes, the Bulldogs!
Surprised they didn't win more.
Well, it's still Mississippi St.
Only fans that envy Ole Miss.
Ha Ha, you know that.
I can't wait for the Cowboys season!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite thing about the NFL?
My least favorite thing would probably be the injuries.
Yeah, the injures always make me feel bad.
Me too! Like these men are just trying to do their jobs.
And a lot of them are really young too.
That's true. Like Teddy Bridgewater.
Yeah, his injury was really nasty. I felt so terrible for him.
I heard he could potentially miss the 2017 season because of it.
That honestly makes me so sad.
Yeah, me too. I hope he comes back soon.
I hope he comes back soon too, but only if he's ready.
Yeah, I don't want him to feel pressured to make a return and get hurt worse.
Especially because he's so young too.
Yeah, I think he's only 24.
I don't want him to be the next Austin Collie.
Don't say that, that guy had so many concussions it was ridiculous.
It really was. I don't want Teddy to be like that.
I don't want anyone to be like that.
Concussions are terrible.
I'm glad we both agree on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL player?
Of all time or currently?
How about of all time?
I would say Lawerence Taylor from the New York Giants.
Why do you like him?
I love the way he played.  He was vicious.
Taylor is said to have been a game changer.
He made the linebacker position more of a complete position.
Who is your current favorite player?
I like watching Le'Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Why him?
I like the way he waits for the hole to open in the line before he runs through it.
He does have a strange running style.
It works really well for him, but not for most running backs.
I don't think I have a favorite player anymore.
What are you talking about?! You have like 3 Tom Brady jersey's.
I guess that if fair.
As I get older I like the team more than a single player anymore.
I understand that.  You see so many players over a lifetime.
Yeah and after a while they start to blend together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always been a San Francisco 49'er fan. I watched them with my father growing up.
They were so awful last season. How can you stay so loyal?
I have great faith in Coach Shanahan. They had some great draft choices this year.
I think it may take more than a couple of good draft choices to regain their top tier status.
Yes, I agree. Do you remember the years when Joe Montana was the quarterback?
I'll say. I was at the game when Montana threw the pass to Dwight Clark in the last seconds to win the game. It was not called the "Immaculate Reception" for nothing!
Those were the days! The team franchise stayed so strong for 14 years. They went to and won 5 Super Bowls during those years.
The team had such a long list of talented players like Freddie Solomon, Steve Young, Deion Sanders and so many more.
I think they had 17 players inducted into the Pro-Football Hall of Fame.
There have been a lot of great football dynasties over the years. Remember the Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
It took a lot to create those dynasties so that they could dominate the other teams for so many years.
This is where the New England Patriots are now. They have been dominating the game since 2001
I think they have been to 7 Super Bowls over the past 16 years and won 5 of them.
I wonder if the Seahawks will be able to unseat them this year and win the Super Bowl.
It is almost impossible to create this kind of dynasty now with the advent of salary caps and free agency.
It shows what an amazing coach Bill Belichick is despite these handicaps.
I agree the coach is crucial to the team. There have been some great ones over the years like Bill Walsh, Chuck Knoll and Don Shula.
I love watching these kinds of coaches become commentators once they retire. Their perspective is so insightful.
I especially love the comments on why a play succeeds and why another play fails.
This is why football is so great.  I can't wait for the season to start.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some of the best NFL video games of all time?
I haven't played any of the recent video games, so my list contains older games.
Like Tecmo Bowl?
Well, Tecmo Super Bowl. That was the first video game with real players and you could choose any team.
Tecmo Super Bowl was great. I loved how it kept stats and you could play a full season.
I remember playing full seasons in one night.
What were some players in that game. That came out in the early 1990's, right?
I believe it was 1991. I remember running backs like Thurman Thomas, Barry Sanders, and Marcus Allen.
Was Bo Jackson unstoppable in that game?
I believe that was regular Tecmo Bowl. He was like a hundred times better than any other player.
I remember some of the Quarterbacks on that game. Warren Moon, Randall Cunningham, Joe Montana.
I loved playing as the Houston Oilers. They had the run and shoot offense.
The run and shoot. That was totally a nineties thing.
They had great receivers and I would just play the entire game throwing bombs down the field.
Houston definitely was good on that game. I always liked playing as the Bills. They had so many offensive weapons.
They were good as well. They had a great defense, if you could even play defense in that game.
What other NFL video games come to mind.
Of course the first Madden games.
Madden definitely was fun back then.
It was the first game that came out where you could actually play defense and the scores were realistic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Getting ready for the upcoming NFL season?
Yeah, I am, got some new jerseys too.
Cool, whose jerseys did you buy?
Odell Beckham Jr and Eli Manning.
Go Giants! We're going to do very good this year.
I believe so too, I cannot wait to get to MetLife Stadium to see some games.
You are going to some games?
Yes, my daughter is finally old enough to take.
Great, sounds like some great bonding time, also another Giants fan in the family.
Hoping for it, you're son really took to the team too.
Yeah, he always watches them on television, hopefully I can take him to a game.
We should go together.
Sounds good, one thing is certain we will be a lot better than the Jets.
I don't think that was a hard conclusion to come to.
Nope, hopefully we can win it all again.
Yes, after all we always come out of nowhere to win.
Just like when we beat the Patriots, nobody really gave us a chance.
How I wish we could do that again in the Super Bowl.
Yes I would love to dethrone the Patriots.
We just need to get to the big game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I think is needed?
What? I can't wait for this one
A new scoring play
Um... What?
A new scoring play. We score how? a field goal or a TD right?
And a safety, and a fair catch kick, oh, and a PAT, but yes. What about?
Yes those too, but we need to allow the QB to throw the ball into the goal.
That' the dumbest idea ever. There is no way NFL owners will go for that.
Not with that kind of attitude.
Not with any kind of attitude, besides, just about all the QBs would be able to make that probably from 100 yards away.
We can make it difficult by putting a net in front of the goal so that you have to throw it into a designated area with a hole in it to go through
That's even dumber that just pitching it into the goal!
Why are you so negative?
I am realistic. Not negative.
I think it's a great idea. it shoul dbe worth 5 points, so if you're down by 5 points after your team makes the FG, then you tie the game and go to overtime
Oh, wait, what? No... There is no way more overtime is welcomed in the NFL. Guys are too old.
But it makes for a better entertainment
But entertainment isn't the issue, players need to rest. They're in their late 20s and 30s. They can't play for overtime constantly. That's why we have sudden death
Sudden death is the dumbest idea ever. They should abolish that.
I don't even know what to tell you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It almost NFL time.
I know I can't wait.
Me either.
Are you going to do the parties at your place this year?
Yes, I am glad I finally have a house big enough.
Sweet! It will be great.
I have a great man cave in my garage.
Cool man.
Yeah, I got a 60 inch HD TV.
The games will be awesome on that.
Yes, I got the package where we can watch all the games too.
Awesome!
Satellite rocks man.
Sounds like you have it all planned out.
I do.
Now, if the Falcons go all the way this year.
This is their year. I feel it.
I hope you are right.
I am. No doubt.
I wish I had your confidence.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Carolina Panthers this season?
I think they are going to have a much more dynamic offense.
Yea me too, I think those rookies they picked up are going to have a big impact.
Cam really needs to step it up a bit this year in the passing game.
I agree, he's a great mobile QB, but he's fallen off a bit since his rookie season in passing.
Well, they certainly do have a lot more targets now for him to throw to.
Yea, McCaffrey is just going to be all over the field.
Devin Funchess hopefully progresses into a bigger role.
Yea if he can step it up a bit, that would be amazing.
Yea, Benjamin and Funchess two twin towers on the outside, with McCaffrey, and Samuel slicing over the field with speed.
Greg Olsen of course too.
As long as their offense steps up a bit I think they win the division.
The defense is solid, a lot just depends on how much the corners and secondary has improved.
True, I did like how we brought buck Munnerlyn.
Remember, Worley had 87 tackles as a rookie corner last year.
That is impressive.
But I really believe Bradberry is the playmaker, look for him to step up.
Yea if those two can improve upon their rookie season, they will be a solid duo.
The front seven bring back Julius Peppers too!
So happy we brought back Peppers and Munnerlyn!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch the Fox pregame show?
Yep, I love it, Terri and Howie crack me up.
Wasn't Terry a quarter back for the Steelers
That he was, and Howie was a defensive end for the Oakland Raiders.
What about the rest of the cast, who did they used to play for?
Let's see, Michael Strahan, defensive lineman for new york giants
Oh, that's right, it is really hard to remember who everyone played for
sure is, I now Jimmy Johnson was  coach for Cowboys
What kind of coach
Sorry, he was head coach for Cowboys from 1989 - 1993 and then went to Dolphins as head coach from 1996 - 1999
Oh, I didn't know he went to Dolphins
Yup he sure was.
So what did he do between 1993 and 1996?
I really don't know
So what about Curt Menefee, what team did he play for?
I don't believe he played for any team, I think he is just a sports broadcaster.
OH okay, So I heard Brett Favre wants to come back in some way to the Packers. Obviously he is too old to play.
Yeah, I heard that, maybe as a quarterback coach? I wonder if he would be any good.
Yeah just because you were a good quarterback, doesn't mean you would be a good coach.
You got that right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Patriots will do this year?
I think they'll do great. They added some great offensive players.
Oh really, who did they add to the team?
Well, Brandon Cooks is one of their new guys. He's a wide receiver.
I've heard of him. He's a really smart player.
He definitely is, they also added a great running back. He led the entire NFL in yards per carry last year.
If Gronkowski stays healthy I think they'll win it all again.
Ya, but do you think Gronk will actually stay healthy?
I don't know, I really hope he does but he never seems to.
If the Patriots actually had him the entire season they would probably win every game.
I agree.
I bet one of the hardest games this year will be the Steelers.
I agree, the Steelers have a great offensive.
Yes, their offensive game is right on level with the Patriots.
Well, I hope Brady stays healthy.
Me too, I'm going to be kinda sad when he retires.
Me too, it's the end of an era.
For sure, he really is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
Well, maybe he can stick it out another few years.
Let's hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about your favorite player?
No! What?
He just got knocked out on the field.
When?
It just happened.
Where was I?
In the kitchen.
Oh no.  Is he up?
Nope.  Still out cold.
This is scary.
They're taking his vitals.
He doesn't look good.
They're putting him on the stretcher.
Great.
But he's still out.
Man, this sucks.
He's doing the thumbs up sign!
And the crowd goes wild.
I'm glad he woke up.
Yeah, me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, being a Detroit Lions fan is hard.
Why is that?
We haven't won a Super Bowl yet!
Oh really? Why not?
Well, we've had pretty good teams before, but there's a big culture of losing in Detroit.
You think that impacts their ability to win?
Yeah, I do. They're so used to losing that they can't win, even with good teams.
Well, they play in a tough division too, don't they?
Yeah, that's true. We have the Packers.
And the Vikings too. They've been tough in the last few years.
Fair enough. But the Lions have had good teams too.
But they don't have a running game at all. Stafford just throws the ball down the field.
I think they're running game would improve if their offensive line was any good.
But they have a solid defense, right?
Yes, though it hasn't been as good since Suh left.
Well, I don't think they're as bad as you say. Playoff football is so tough.
It is. One loss and you're done.
Right, so it doesn't really matter how good your team is. It's just one bad game and you're finished.
So maybe they just haven't played a good playoff game yet.
Maybe. I suppose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old were you when you started watching football.
Probably while I was still in my mom's belly.
Were you parents big NFL fans?
I would definitely say so since we had four TV going every Sunday simultaneously.
Was just your dad a fan or did your mom like football too?
It was both of them.
Did they like the same teams?
No way. It did not matter whether it was college or NFL football they seemed to like the biggest rival of each others teams.
Who did they root for?
My mom was and Eagles Fan and do you know who their biggest rival is?
No who?
Dallas Cowboys which happens to be my dads team.
And which one of those do you root for?
I do not like either team.
Then who is your home team?
I root for Denver.
Why don't you root for the Eagles?
I don't like the coaching staff and the way they run their team.
And why don't you like Dallas?
Because I can't stand Tony Romo as a person or player and Jerry Jones is a bully and a cheat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you do on your trip to San Francisco?
Actually I ended up going to a 49ers games.
You did? Was it fun?
Tons! I hadn't been to a football game in ages.
Who was playing?
It was the 49ers vs the Seahawks.
That sounds like it could've been an exciting game.
It was! I got really into it.
Who won in the end?
The 49ers. It was great.
I'm glad it was the team you wanted!
Me too.
It's been a long time since I've seen a game in person.
We should go sometime! I bet we can get tickets to a Brancos game sometime.
Hmm. Yeah, that could be fun.
Let me look it up and see when we could get tickets.
How's it look?
There are some affordable tickets for a game in two weeks.
Great! Let's go.
I'll buy them now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which football player do you think had the hardest time retiring?
Brett Farve 100%.
What makes you say that?
Are you serious?
Yeah, I don't recall anything about him that was that bad.
He retired 3 times man,
What? When?
First from Green Bay. I think it was the off season when he did that.
Okay.
Then he retired from the Jets.
I forgot he was on that team.
Lastly he retired from the Vikings.
Ok I totally forgot he was on the Jetd and the Vikings.
It got so bad that nobody cared if he was going to retire anymore.
I guess considering how many times he announced it people got burned out on the information.
I certainly did. The guy just didn't want to let go of his career.
Well maybe it was the fame, or the competition you know?
Yeah but come on the guy is almost 50 years old.
What agre did he retire?
He was forty when he finally hung it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think wins the NFC South this year?
Not sure, do you think Atlanta repeats?
Could be, this is a tough division to predict.
The Panthers were great just one year before and could be a threat.
I didn't see how they went down so fast last year.
Cam Newton is a tough player.
Do you think the Bucs have any chance?
With picking up Desean Jackson I think their offense improves.
With the deep threat they can stretch the field.
He is worth a touchdown deep ball a game I think.
He does that but the overall game isn't as strong.
I heard the Saints picked up Adrian Peterson.
Maybe so but I don't think this team is going anywhere again.
Drew Brees is getting older and they just don't have the team around him.
I think it will either be Atlanta or Carolina.
I agree but I think the Bucs will be better.
Still I can't see two teams that went to the Superbowl the last couple of years being unseated.
I think Carolina just had one of those wierd down years even though they still had a good team.
I think they could bounce back this year.
It will be tough with Matt Ryan and all the talent Atlanta still has.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We've got another football team in LA!
I know! The Chargers and the Rams are here now.
Which would you rather see?
I'd say the Chargers. I think they're going to be better this year.
I agree and the AFC West is looking really good now.
No joke, I think it might be the best division in football.
The Raiders took huge steps this offseason.
The Broncos still have that incredible defense.
And Kansas City is looking as good as last year too.
Just comes down to the Chargers then.
I guess so. I think they had too many close games slip away last year.
Yeah, I felt like they lost a lot of games late in the fourth quarter.
I wonder if it'll swing their way this season.
Either way, I'll try and get Chargers tickets this season.
I hear they're in Stubhub.
Yeah, it only seats 30,000 so the environment is more intense.
I'm sure they'll take every advantage they can get.
I hear that.
Good luck getting tickets.
Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what teams do want to see in the next Super Bowl?
Ideally for me, it would be a Bears versus Packers Super Bowl.
I do love the rivalry there.
However, I do not see that happening.
Yeah I don't either.
Who would you like to see in the Super Bowl?
I would really like to see the Titans, or the Falcons again.
The Titans made some good pick ups in the draft. It's possible.
Yeah. I think they'll be strong, but not Super Bowl material.
True. There are other teams that look much stronger.
I just don't want to see the Patriots again.
I don't either. Unfortunately they're the top ranked team still in the power rankings.
It's not that they don't deserve it. I'm just tired of seeing them.
I have to agree with you there.
It's still highly possible that we see the Packers or the Cowboys go to the next Super Bowl.
That would be a nice change of pace.
They are both looking very strong this year.
I've always thought Aaron Rodgers was a huge talent.
He's one of the best for sure.
He just had a bit of misfortune last season that held the team back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i am still working on that NFL trivia list for that book.
Do you need some help?
Yes please. Tell me what you think of some of the ones I have.
Here let me get you started with one I saw.The Washington Redskins were the last segregated team in the NFL.
I have never heard that before.
Also did you know that Tony Dungy is the first African-American coach to win a Super Bowl.
Oh you know that speaking of people of different ethnicities did you know that there is  56 % chance of American Samoans  to be drafted.
It makes since they are some big boys.
Running back Ricky Williams is a qualified yoga instructor.
That is a great thing to be. I wonder if any of his fellow players do yoga?
I know that I heard at one time that some players took ballet for flexibility  and balance.
Is that really true?
NFL Hall of Fame member Lynn Swann even credits his graceful performance in games in part to flexibility that he learned from ballet training and other dance classes, adding that this training helped him achieve body control, balance and a sense of rhythm and timing.
Wow that's cool they don't let it effect their masculinity.
Patriots defensive lineman Richard Seymour plays the trombone. I thought that was pretty cool.
Yeah he may play but does he play well?!!
Good point! I guess you would have to ask those around him!
It sounds like you are coming along pretty well.
Thanks! I am not sure where I am going next
Good luck and let me know when you have some more you want me to listen to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
All right fans we're back live with Dave Johnson the voice of the Texans.  How's training camp going Dave?
Well, Jim the guys are having a great time getting ready for their first pre-season game.
So give us an insiders look at the team for this year.  What do Texan fans have to look forward too?
The Houston Texans are going to have a great turnout this year.  Our offense is going to go through some changes for the better.
What are you going to do to get the offense better then last year?
We are working on shoring up the tight end position.
You do have a couple of new tight ends now.  How are they going to fit into the lineup.
Well, we've got one that will take on the starting position and the other will fill in on third down situations.
Ok, what else is the offense doing.
Well, we are taking on a more pass/run philosophy instead of run first.  This will be different and fans will see us going up and down the field more I think.
But will that translate into more tuchdowns?
You know I think it will.  We've got some great receivers on the team and adding some strong blocking from the Tight End position will help give them time to get freed up.
What about the offensive line?  They were pretty good last year.
They sure were and we aren't doing a darn thing there except resigning Masey to make sure that line stays together for a long time.
Any news on the defensive end of things.
Well yeah,  we've added a few parts in the back field.
I know you've picked up a new Saftey.  How's he working out.
Jones, yeah.  He's starting to get into the motion of the game now.  It will take a little while for him to get into NFL shape but I think he'll be in the rotation from the first game.
All right folks we're going to take a break for a moment and we'll be right back with Dave Johnson and see how he thinks the division will go this year.  All right Dave, nice job.
Thanks Jim.  This is kinda fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see they released the 2017 NFL Schedule?
I did! Looks like there will be some good games!
I know, it seems like the Draft just happened but Training Camp opens in 3 weeks.
Training Camp is such a tease, I think they need to shorten the pre-season to 2 games.
So do I, 4 games is unnecssary, especially when you have to pay the same price for tickets as you do in the regular season.
Those games should be comped, there is more entertainment at the high school level!
The third game isn't bad, at least you get to see the stars a bit longer.
Speaking of stars, why do you think Colin Kaepernick still isn't signed?
Hard to tell - he has such a unique skill set, I think the controversy is kind of drummed up to pass the time.
I tend to agree, I wasn't a big fan of his play dating back to his time at Nevada.
It would be interesting to see him get a shot with a team that is just a QB away.
Perhaps - maybe a team like the Texans could pick him up.
That's not a bad idea, it seems like any one they could sign would be better than they have.
Well they did take a QB high in the draft.
True - what was his name?
I don't remember, maybe that speaks to why they should look into signing someone else!
What do you think of the Raiders chances with Carr back?
They have as good of a chance as anyone, especially with Lynch in the fold.
It will be interesting to see, the AFC West is kind of a mixed bag with Denver, San Diego and KC.
I think KC will be the team to beat in that Division, but I've always pulled for Rivers in San Diego.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Think the Patriots will again this year?
Yes. This year and the next. Then the wheel start to fall off
What do you mean?
Brady will be 42 in two years...I think. Father time will catch up with him
Suprised that it hasn't already?
In a way. I think he made a deal with the devil.
Hahahahaha, that, crazy man
Then explain to me how he is able to produce this long...
I can't. Been wondering a bit about that myself.
For some strange reason he's been able to do this for this long, missing only one year.
Nothing changes with that team, and I hate it so much
Don't know how they do it.
I'm not really worried about them doing it. I mad beause my team ain't doing it
Hahahahaha true. It burns me too.
Nothing we can do about it either.
I am not ready to give up yet.
That's cool...just don't hold your breath
Never had...lol
Wait a minute, who is your team?
Cincinnati
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who's the worst team in the league?
The very worst team?  I don't know, NFL is funny that way sometimes.
What do you mean?
Well, you can say a team in the preseason, but it seems like the worst teams always do a bit better.
And some good teams really shoot themselves?
Right.  All about staying healthy.
If I had to pick a team to get #1 next year, I would go with the Jets.
Yeah, they are a straight mess.
They probably have the worst stable of QB's in the league.
Who's their starter, isn't it Geno Smith?
Nah, he's on some other team now.
Oh, I remember, it's Josh McNown.
Wow, that is pretty bad.
They've drafted some guys too.  I think a few picks the last few years.
Yeah, they took the guy out of Penn State a couple years go.
Hackenburg I think.  They're hoping he can be something for them.
Whatever the case might be, that's a team in disarray.
Like I said, probably the worst team in the league.
If so, at least they'll be able to do something with the high pick.
Provided they don't blow it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey dude.
what's up?
You a redskins fan
Yup
Really?
Yup
Why?
Because they're good
Nope
Yup
If you say so
I do
What did you think of robert griffin
His first season was a fluke
Plus he got that contract off of one good season in college
That's true
I guess the redskins thought he was going to be a good QB
I could have told them different
Me too
We should be GM's
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am still amazed by Superbowl LI.
You're just saying that because you're from Boston.
Yes.  I thought the game was over.
The Falcons played a great first half.
Yes, they scored three unanswered touchdowns.
The interception was a killer.
So it seemed.  21-3 at the half.
Lady Gaga was great at halftime.
I did not watch it.
It was 28-3 just a few minutes later.
I was pretty much devastated by then.
But they came back.
It still looked bad at 28-12.
Then the fumble.
They had some life then.
28-20 soon afterward.
I cannot believe the Falcons took themselves out of field goal range.
Leading up to the great Edelman catch, and the tie.
I knew they would win in overtime.
The only time they had the lead, 34-28.  Amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Saw an interesting announcement last week. Did you see Doug Williams is going to the Redskins front office?
I did. Think he can save them from their crazy owner?
Daniel Snyder has more money than sense.
You're right. What's happening with Cousins?
Kirk Cousins is a class act.
I agree. did they ever get his contract straightened out?
Not sure. July 15 is the deadline.
There's just too much drama on this team.
I agree, but I think there's drama on every team.
In know, right?
San Francisco didn't renew Colin Kaepernick.
That's probably for the best. The guy was a huge distraction.
So disrespectful when he would take a knee during our National Anthem.
You know who I miss?  Tim Tebow
I liked him. I never understood why Denver let him go.
Denver had Peyton ready to go. That guy is a machine.
Is Peyton coming back this year?  I never heard.
How did you miss that?  He retired from the NFL.
Probably a good move for him.
Agreed, go out on his own terms as  a winner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best defensive player in the NFL? I think it is Luke Kuechly
He's a very good defensive player but i think it is JJ Watt
Who do you think the best offensive player is in the NFL? I think it is Dak Prescott
I think it is Aaron Rodgers
Who is best overall QB in the NFL? I think it would be Terry Bradshaw
It has to be Bart Star to me
Who is the best WR you think? I think it is Jerry Rice
I will agree with you on that. But i think Randy Moss is up there too.
Who do you thimk will get MVP this year? I think Cam Newton
I think he has a good chance but i think that Derek Carr will probably get it.
Who will get Rookie of the year? I think Christian McCaffrey
I think it will be Deshaun Watson
Who do you think is the best RB right now? I think Marshawn Lynch
I think it has to be Ezekiel Elliott
I think the the best team in the NFL is Oakland Raiders. Who do you think?
I think its the New England Patriots
But Tom Brady is almost ready to retire.
Yeah but he has at least 3 or 4 years left.
That's true but can he beat the record for most rings in NFL history.
He might be able to do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Eagles, Broncos, Chiefs, Seahawks, Raiders, Cardinals.
What about them? Why are you just rattling off teams.
These are the teams that the Giants have to actually work at beating this year.
You're right and we play Philly twice this year.
Eagles will win both games, but I think all the others are going to be close.
What do you think is going to be the deciding factor?
Offensive line. They need to show up to the game.
You're right. They did nothing to improve the situation this summer either.
We spent a lot of time concentrating on defense and I'm not sure it was the right move.
Well the league is filled with offense heavy teams this year, so maybe it was the right thing to do.
But the league is also heavy with big defenses.
Ok. So what do we need to get around Seattle. They're the real threat.
Prayer and maybe some wizardry. They are going to eat our O-line alive
I hope Eli worked on his agility drills this summer because he's going to be doing a lot of running that game.
I doubt we will see any more movement from Eli, he's not getting any younger.
Maybe his age will impart some wisdom that will help them will a win against them.
They passed on a lot of O-line talent in the draft, maybe he should have imparted some of that wisdom on Jerry Reese.
He's made a lot of questionable decisions lately.
Yeah but he's been one of the best at assembling talent since he almost got fired.
Questionably the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
Yes, I can't wait, I really hope the Rams do good this season.
Do you think they will start of with Jared Goff?
I hope so, he really needs to prove that he is a franchise player.
I don't know he has not lived up to the expectations of a franchise player.
I know, I am worried about it, he has to show something.
Agreed, hopefully he has improved over the summer.
How about you, are you high on your team, the Saints?
Yes, I think we got Drew Brees a decent defense, I think we will get back into the playoffs.
I really do want to see Brees in the playoffs, he is a top 3 quarterback and really deserves more post season success.
Exactly, he has been lighting up the league, imagine if he had a good defense.
Yep, I think they would have won a few more Superbowls.
Well, I'll be happy as long as the Patriots don't win again, I really don't like their arrogance.
I agree, hopefully they get taken out early and not make the Superbowl so we can see new teams.
Yep, I kind of want them to miss the post season, but more likely they win more than 12 games again this season.
Yeah that's a safe bet.
Any teams you think will be a surprise this season?
Maybe Miami, they may come out of nowhere and do good.
I don't think so, I think the Bears may surprise.
Well one thing is for certain, this season will be a roller coaster.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the craziest play you have ever heard of in NFL history?
Oh I'd have to say it was the game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders in 1972.
Thats an incredibly old game.
Yeah it's way before your time but let me tell you. You'll never see another play like that ever,
So what happened in this game?
Pittsburgh was down 7 to 6 with 22 seconds left and had a fourth and tenth situation at their 40 line.
Sounds like a bad situation.
Oh it was, If I was on the team at that time I'd assume it's game over at this point.
So what happened next?
The quarterback which was Terry Bradshaw at the time threw a pass intended for one of his teammates I can't remember who.
I take it he didn't find his mark?
No the throw got blocked by one of the raiders and the ball went flying off screen.
Then what happened?
One of the steelers Franco Harris I believe managed to catch the ball keeping it in play.
No way.
Yes sir, he then sprinted his way to the goal making his team take the lead with 5 seconds left on the clock.
That is amazing I'll have to look up that play.
It was such an impossible play that it's been named "The Immaculate Reception".
That's pretty funny.
It was an amazing thing to see. Like I said that will never happen again in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL announcer?
I don't like any of them
Why not?
They're all not that smart
I agree they don't add much to the game
I like Terry Bradshaw
He is entertaining in the pregame shows
Who did he play for?
I think he was a Cowboys quarterback
I'm happy there are more and more people of color becoming quarterbacks
The NFL and the college level are certainly making strides
They need to get more minority head coaches as well
I agree. It's important
I like that Sarah Thomas is a refferee in the league
Oh me too.
I wish there were more females represented in general
Right and not just as sideline reporters
Though Erin Matthews is great
I like her reporting
She knows what she's talking about
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Eagles new draft picks?
They seem to have it going on.
Really, that's great!
They were superstars in college and going to help this season.
Rookies can make a team, but it's hard.
Yeah, new blood is good.
I hope to see them play at the park this year.
Sweet!
Are you going tailgating this season?
Absolutely.
How often do you go?
Every game that I go to we always tailgate.
Do a lot of people?
Yeah. It's usually a good crowd.
Do you get rowdy?
Nah, just enjoy ourselves enough to not get in trouble.
What do you eat?
We pack some good grilling things and drinks.
Awesome.
You wanna come with sometime?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, excited about the Cowboys chances for next season?
You bet! Would have loved keeping Romo on the bench for insurance since you saw him step in at the end of the season last year and make a TD, but whatever.
Dak and Zeke are amazing, but makes you think they won't flake out in their sophmore year?
I think Prescott has the maturity to keep going--he's already shown his leadership with the old guys. I just hope Elliott doesn't get himself hurt with all his gymnastics!
Zeke's on fire! He's fun to watch.
Yeah, he sure does light a spark under that offense and makes those veteran look life-like again!
Now if they could only pull it off during post-season--it sucks only getting there and then never winning.
I don't know what it is about the post-season. Even with a bye week they still managed to come in and screw it up.
Just can't play more than 16 games a year, I guess!
I don't know if it's coaching or what?
Same thing happens every time they get there since.... I don't know... Coach Switzer? Back in the mid 90s??
I blame Jerry Jones. I know he got us three rings but it seems like he cost the team a lot of integrity.
What do you think people want--Super Bowls or integrity? I bet I know...
Truth... it's about the money. Not like when Tex Schramm and Landry ran the team.
Nah, still about money, just in a different way. Stop being so idealistic! Remember all the guys that had the team after Schramm sold it.
I'd just like to see my 'Boys win and stop getting into trouble.
... and Jerry Jones keep out of coaching and player business and just stay up in the owner's suite where he frickin' belongs!
Here here!!
Makes me want to go down to the new stadium in Arlington and pay some exorbitant price for a ticket!
Not so new! But, then again, I last saw them was in the "old" stadium in Irving, and they had been there since before I was born!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of drills do football players do?
I always see them banging their bodies into metal things they push.
I always saw them training on the bleachers.
Me too.
Did you used to play football at all?
No, but when I ran cross-country I'd see them at the track too.
They seem to train in a lot of different ways.
Yeah, they also were always lifting weights.
That's pretty important too.
They have to have brains to learn passes as well.
It takes skill, dedication, and effort to be good.
Football players don't always get the credit they deserve.
Being an athlete takes a lot of mental stamina.
Yeah, there are often negative stereotypes.
It's a shame.
Everyone has talents and we need to give credit where credit is due.
I agree.
Hard work is important and drive.
Determination is a must in football.
Bravery is important as well!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you follow?
I like the lions
Oh yea? Are you excited that Ameer is coming back?
of course! hopefully we will have a good season this year.
It seems like the lions do well in preseason then they choke
Yup. It's tough being a fan.
Do you like any other teams?
Not really, I mean I always root for the underdogs in the superbowl.
Really? So, you want the falcons to win.
Yes, I am not a Brady fan at all.
Hmm... What did you think of deflate-gate?
It was a bit ridiculous, i'll have to admit that.
yea it seemed like there was a lot of new information coming out every day.
Oh well, Brady is still going...
True.
Who do you root for?
The packers.
Ah, that's too bad.
Yea, well I love Aaron Rodgers.
I'll give you that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you going to watch much football this upcoming NFL season?
Yes, my favorite team is the Dallas Cowboys
Yeah, they are a great team with good young talent
Yeah, Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott are definite offensive stars
I think the Cowboys have a good shot of winning the NFC East and making a Superbowl
Yeah, the NFC East is weak outside of the Cowboys
Who do you think will win the AFC this season?
I expect the New England Patriots will win it again this year
Yeah, they are definite contenders but Tom Brady is getting older
Brady may be getting older but the team around him is still elite
You are right, Rob Gronkowski will be back and hopefully remain healthy for a whole season
With Gronkowski being healthy, I cannot see the Patriot's offense being stopped
You are right, teams would have to put the majority of the focus on him which would open up other receivers
Yeah, the best chance defenses would have would be to rush Brady so that he does not have much time to throw at all
A good pass rushing defense that could challenge is the Houston Texans
Yeah, JJ Watt gets a lot of sacks and tipped passes
Hopefully JJ Watt recovers from last year's injury and is back to his elite form
Even if he isn't, the Texans also have Jadeveon Clowney who can also get sacks
Yeah, I remember when Jedeveon Clowney was picked number one overall
He is a definite game changer and defensive force
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the state of the NFL?
Many people consider it to be the most popular league in the world.
Yes, and the Super Bowl is often the most watched annual event.
Each team is worth over 1 billion dollars.
The Cowboys are worth several billion.
An ad during the Super Bowl costs $100,000 per second.
Okay, so we're in agreement that the NFL is a big business.
Yes, many people have become very wealthy because of the NFL.
So, what's the problem?
The biggest problem is player safety.
How so?
The players are becoming increasingly concerned about CTE.
What's that?
CTE is chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It's caused by repeated blows to the head.
Such as those sustained while playing football?
Exactly!
How is the league dealing with this issue?
They are changing the rules of the game to make it more safe.
That's good. Are there any other changes going on in the NFL?
Yes, the league is constantly trying to improve the equipment.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the NFC North this year?
I'd have to go with Green Bay again.
With Aaron rogers on the roster they are always contenders.
And the receivers are solid.
My concern is with the defense, though.
They had the worst defensive secondary in the league last year I think.
I think Minnesota might take it.
Do you think Sam Bradford has what it takes.
he has been stuck in mediocrity but I think he has had little help.
He tends to do a lot of safe passes.
I think if you build a team around him he can be effective.
I think the Vikings will have the best defense in the league.
That and getting the offense on board could make them contenders this year.
You think Chicago has any chance?
Probably not, they have no quarterback.
I think they've lost even more talent compared to last year.
Think the Lions will do anything.
Matthew Stafford is a good quarterback but I don't think they have the team.
You don't think they will make the playoffs.
The receivers are getting older and they have weakness on defense.

How big is sports betting for the Super Bowl (and is there a way to put this in context)?
If you include all the props and futures (odds to win Super Bowl included) that we offer on it, the Super Bowl makes up 7 percent of our total betting volume for the year.
The way to look at it is, the whole state (of Nevada) does about roughly $3.5 billion (for sports betting), and this game does somewhere around $100 million. Last year, it was $120 (million). So that right there will tell you how much of the whole year this game is, 3 percent really is what it is.
The NFL is about 20% of our whole year in sports betting and the Super Bowl is 5-10% of the total money we take on the NFL. So roughly 2 per cent.”
Most people think of betting the game and lines, but what value do proposition bets bring to this event? Does it bring the once-a-year type of bettor (marginal) into the equation? Do prop bets get more action than traditional bets?
Prop bets are something we take pride in; we offer prop bets throughout the whole year in every sport, entertainment, politics and business, but there is no question that the Super Bowl prop bets started the popularity of this type of wagering.  About 30% of our new clients that sign up leading up to Super Bowl their first bet ever is on some sort of prop so that shows the significance props play in our business.
I think there are definitely some value plays when it comes to Super Bowl props bets. Just look at the coin toss, only have to lay 3 cents juice on this prop. Typically have to lay 10 cents juice on a NFL game line. Prop bets make just under 30 percent of our total Super Bowl betting handle.
When you first put them up, it’s 100 percent sharps betting them. That’s what they’re doing, they’re just waiting for you to put them up, trying to find the weak spots, trying to put one place against another. They’re trying to arbitrage the props, that’s all it is. After that, it’s basically all the guests coming to town that bet them. So what happens is the sharps hit them first and then the guys coming to town get the second shot at them. That’s kind of the way it is. I’d say the sharps are only about maybe 15 percent of the action.
I heard that prop bets exploded with the "Will Refrigerator Perry score a touchdown" bet. Any idea on when the "entertaining" bets came into being, i.e., length of the national anthem, wardrobe changes, first commercial, etc.?
Perry scoring a TD to me is a prop, but nothing compared to what we offer now and, online, we have the freedom to offer pretty much anything we want.  Yes sometimes they can be hard to grade, like will Bill Belichick smile on camera in the Super Bowl, but this type of prop betting really started I would say about 10 years ago once online gaming became more and more popular.
Super Bowl prop bets really started to get popular mid-1990s thanks in large part to Imperial Palace in Las Vegas. Many of those guys that made those prop bets are now at Westgate Sportsbook. The guys at Imperial palace not only offered quality Super Bowl props, they offered a high quantity of props as well. It’s one of those things where if you have the creative insight, the sky's the limit as far as Super Bowl props you can offer.
What is your favorite proposition bet of all time?
I have done so many, but one that always stands out was after the Tebow era where every week we had props on him was "What will he do first? Throw another TD Pass in the NFL or admit to having Sexual Intercourse." Yes maybe a bit offside but I still laugh at that one when I see it in our system since we are still waiting to grade it!”
I like the national anthem over/under time in seconds prop. Since you get new performers every year, the over/under number is always different. We usually scour the internet, going to YouTube, and such to try and find past performances of the artist performing the national anthem.
This year we have Time It Takes Idina Menzel To Sing National Anthem as 122.5 seconds. We opened it 121.5 seconds and 88% of the early money was on the over, so we moved it up another second. This is always one of the most popular props with the betting public. It is a prop you can get many people to bet, people who don’t normally bet on the NFL.
My favorite, and we still do it, is the average number of all the jerseys to score a touchdown.
I think that’s my favorite because it takes a little bit of thinking. You have to figure out who may score, if #85 scores and #12 scores twice, so that’s one of my favorites. That’s ours, we have a lot of our own individual props, and I’m sure everybody has their own. But there’s some that we have originated here that we continue to stay with.
How often do you bet on the NFL?
I like to bet every game.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the greatest NFL team of all time?
Most people say the 1972 Miami Dolphins.
Why?
They went undefeated.
Wow, that's impressive!
No one has done it since.
Who was on that team?
The stars were Mercury Morris, Larry Csonka, Bob Griese, and Earl Morrall.
Who was the coach?
They were coached by Don Shula.
That's a pretty amazing cast.
Yes, many of them are in the Hall of Fame.
Are you sure no other team went undefeated?
Three other teams went undefeated during the regular season only.
I see. What are those teams?
They are the 1934 Chicago Bears, the 1942 Chicago Bears, and the 2007 New England Patriots.
Wow, that's a special list.
Yes, those are some of the greatest teams ever.
What team didn't you list?
The 1985 Chicago Bears had probably the best defense ever. And, they were also a great overall team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What one play in your team's history would you change?
I'd probably pick Demarco Murray fumbling in 2014 against the Packers.
I have no regrets about that. Going to two consecutive Super Bowls and winning one ought to be enough for any Seattle fan.
Absolutely, but that 'what if...' will always be in the back of my head. Then again, if we ran and failed (totally possible), we'd be wondering the opposite. Oh well.
I will argue to the ends of the earth that that pass play was the correct call. It just happened to be defended perfectly.
Should the NFL offseason be shorter? Why or why not?
No. Too many injuries if the season was any longer.
Could add more bye weeks to make season longer but still have 16 games.
I think this would lead to more injuries, but if it didn't, I wouldn't mind adding two more games and bye weeks. So the season would be 18 games and 3 byes.
See, I don't think we will see that much of an additional injury impact just because there is already a lot of injuries. You also have guys returning from injuries that were experienced early on, you always see that. Plus, the age old football motto of "next man up" will be more important than ever.
If it was any longer I think teams would need two byes.
They should already get on that. Give each team 2 byes, have them spaced out between weeks 3 and 15. That way they have football on more weeks in the year and slightly fewer games per week so smaller market teams don't lose as much viewership to big games.
3-4 game expansion wouldn't require an additional bye, in my opinion of course. They could offer more spaced out games, whether it be Thursday or Monday. Although, I get it.
3-4 more games? And not another bye? Why do you want football players to die?
Why is everyone so convinced that Jared Goff is already a bust?
He has no defined status. Being in limbo between bust and not bust status is much like Schrodinger's cat. If one is observed, the other must necessarily not exist; until the observation is made, both are correct.
So, in other words, to say he is a bust would be to make a correct (even if incomplete) statement.
Insofar as being both correct and incorrect at the same time, sure. I mean, you can't choose to be one or the other. If you make one statement, you must acknowledge the other.
well, yeah it'd be fallacious, I get all that, but I'm just trying to poke fun.
While joking about it is a lot of Goff hate. I also think right or wrong there is a perception that Goff is unintelligent due to his guffaw on Hard Knocks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Jerry Rice is the best NFL receiver ever?
Without a doubt.
I think so too but there have been some great ones.
Yeah, tons. Like Randy Moss.
yeah, Moss was good. Especially when he was with the Vikings.
Yeah, he was a beast there.
I bet the Vikings will be pretty good this year.
Even without Adrian Peterson?
Yeah, I think they will be better off without him.
He was pretty good for awhile.
Yeah, that year he almost beat the record, that was great.
He is getting old though.
Yeah.
I just hope the Patriots don't win again this year.
They need to stop winning Super Bowls haha.
Yes! Leave some for the rest of us.
It has been so long since my team has won.
Mine too, who is your favorite team?
Chicago Bears. Yours?
Dallas Cowboys.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you looking forward to the upcoming NFL season?
Yes, miss watching some football.
Who you rooting for this year?
The Philedelphia Eagles, the represent my hometown.
I hear you, I guess that is why I want Tampa Bucs to go all the wat this year.
Have you made it to any games last season?
Yes and I want to make it to a few this season.
How much do tickets usually go for?
I don't know if they are different for every team, but I usually pay about $280 and under.
That is not bad. I guess it depends on where you sit.
Right, and I want to sit up close, so I can check out this knew quarterback Tampa has.
And who might that be?
His name is Ryan Fitzpatrick and he is to be Jameis Winston back up.
Yeah, I know of him. He was playing with the New York Jets.
Yes. He was with them for I believe 2 years. He comes with rave reviews.
That is great. The Eagles added Matt McGloin to their QB roster.
Oh yeah. He played with the Raiders, right?
Yeah, for the seasons in 2015-2016.
Well alls I can say is good luck and hope your team does well.
Thanks and same to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what?
What?
We got the NFL Sunday Ticket this year.
Great, I'm coming to watch the games.
That means I won't miss one Miami game all year.
I could also see my team too, right?
I guess so, we could split the screen.
I have to watch Tennessee.
It's weird you pick such an odd team.
Why, the Titans are good.
Yeah, I guess they are.
Delanie Walker is a good player.
I never heard of him.
Really? Not even with Fantasy Football rosters?
No.
Guess you don't pay much attention to all the NFL teams.
Actually, you're right.
Not a big fan of the team colors, but what are you going to do, right?
What are their colors?
Usually a weird powder blue.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who I miss and what's missing from football these days?
Um...what about actual play without all the mamby-pamby rules?
No, that's not what I mean. I miss the immediate sense of the game and the innovation.
Dude, that's why I watch college football.
I know, remember when Tebow was playing in the NFL?
I remember he was bad at it.
No, not at all! Well, yes he was, but a Tebow football game was exciting!
I'll give you that, but it was all the team around him making up for bad play.
It's always the team dude, Peyton Manning in his last superbowl had a rating of 27, it was the team then too.
I suppose i can give you that, but why Tebow?
I always compared Tebow and Manning, Tebow was organic and exciting, Manning was cool and collected.
It you're gonna say Tebow was better than Manning....I'm out of here
THat's not it at all, I'm saying Tebow was more exciting to watch even though Manning is a better QB
How so?
Well, like in that playoff game against the Steelers, Tebow was unpredictable, he could move as an RB and still had a QB threat.
So could a lot of run-option Qbs
I know, but they have to skitter to the side, his build meant he might go up the middle, that you needed to blitz to take him down, and he was fast and slippery
I did like to see the QB play the game with the rest.
So I'm just saying, Tebow was exciting and I miss that in a lot of games.
I get what you're saying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for football?
I am always excited.
Who do you think will do better.
I think the falcons will take it all.
I think the cowboys will make their way.
They are good too.
Yeah they have alot of young players.
They have some good ones.
I think with them being younger int he nfl it helps alot.
I do to.
It makes them seem healthier.
I agree.
I think it helps them not get as injured as much.
Yeah the older ones get hurt more.
I think the younger ones bodies can handle more.
I agree. I think they sustain more.
I think they take care of their bodies better.
They also have not had the experience the others do.
It will be exciting to watch.
I cannot wait to se it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Tom Brady has written a book?
No, is it about football and the NFL, or about his personal life?
It's about training to be an athlete more than about the games or teams.
He must know something about training since he's such a great player.
The book title is about sustaining peak performance. I imagine he does have to really work hard to stay in shape since he's had such a long career.
That was something last winter when New England won the Super Bowl.
I know, it was New England's fifth time winning the Super Bowl.
I would have thought he would have written a book about the games he's played.
He said the book shows how he's been able to succeed as an athlete because of the way he trains.
So it's not just a lot of practice that makes him good?
No, he has an unusual way of training he said.
I'm sure that will be useful to new athletes who are trying to make it onto the big teams.
He also said he has an unusual approach and method of exercise.
I would think exercise is super important for being able to keep up your strength during the game.
Yeah, everyone could use exercise to keep up their energy at whatever they do.
I'm curious how much time someone like Brady exercises to stay in shape.
The book comes out in September.
I think it would be interesting reading.
He should go on a book tour and sign copies, and they would sell out everywhere he went.
Wow, wouldn't that be something to be able to get Tom Brady's autograph?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen a lot of NFL games--what's the best game you've ever seen?
In person or on television?
Start with in person.
You know I'm not thinking of a particular game, but there is the most exciting play.
O.K--hit me with that one.
It was Steve Young's long run to beat the Vikings.
I remember that--how long was it?
I think it was about 50 yards, but that's not the best thing.
What was?
Well, he broke a bunch of tackles and barely made it to the end zone where he stumbled in for what was to be the winning touchdown.
O.K. what was the most exciting game including television.
"The Catch" when San Francisco beat Dallas.
Geez--everything is 49ers.
Well, I'm a 49er fan--what would you expect excitement about a Buffalo Bills game?
Point taken--so what was so great about that game.
At the time the Dallas Cowboys was the team--America's team if you must, and to get anywhere you had to get past them.
I remember.
Well, the Montana to Clark catch beat them.
Was it a great catch?
Well, admittedly it was just a little better than routine, but in context it was "The Catch".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Bears?
Sure, I do.
Who is your favorite defense player?
Adrian Amos is my favorite Bears player on defense.
What ever happened to Cutler?
He got injured and release from the Bears.
I like Grossman, he got us to the Superbowl in 2007.
Yeah, that's true,
Too bad he just couldn't get going after that.
Yes, I agree with that.
Some people just are lucky enough to keep winning and some aren't.
Yeah, that's just part of the game, I guess.
Its tough to get a ball down the field when you have a pack of five to ten 300 plus pounders going after you.
Yeah, its a tough job, quarterbacking.
I like the tailgating at the games.
Yeah, me to those are nice to go to.
I like to tailgate whenever I can.
Yeah, its the best way you can support your team.
I get tired of watching because my teams never make it.
Then you need to get on the bandwagon with the Patriots!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, when's the NFL season start?
The season opener is September 7th!
Awesome, I'm so excited.
Same, who do you think is gonna win MVP?
Tough to say, if I had to guess I would say Tom Brady
I think he should too, but they hold him to a higher standard
Yeah, I know what you mean. He really has to limit his mistakes if he wants to win it
Yeah, and if any other QB has a really good year they'll lean towards him
Kinda like coach of the year
Exactly. Belichick is definitely the best coach but they never give him the award
Yeah, it normally goes to a coach with a decent roster that makes playoffs
Or a team that gets a lot of injuries and still plays well
Yeah, that too
How about rookie of the year, who's gonna win that?
It's gotta be Myles Garrett
Really? I think it's gonna be Christian McCaffrey
Why?
He's gonna get a lot of opportunities to make big plays
But the Panther's offensive line is so bad
Yeah, but he can catch passes too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to this NFL season?
Yea, it should be a great season as always.
It is hard to wait for it, seems like forever.
It definitively is.
What is your favorite team to watch?
My favorite is the Bengals. What is yours?
I like the Rams.
Ah, They should be better this year.
Yea, I hope so.
Wonder if the Bengals will make it far this year.
They always have a good year but never in the postseason.
It is sad to watch.
Yes it is.
I think Dalton needs to move on.
I would like to see that.
I was happy with AJ playing for him.
We actually watched them play the ravens last year.
They lost that one didnt they?
They sure did.
Those poor Bengals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What teams do you think are going to the NFL playoffs this season?
In the AFC, at least three of last year's playoff teams are - New England, Pittsburgh and Oakland.
Yeah, can't argue with that. But who else?
In the AFC South, I an't see Houston repeating as division champions.
Me neither, that was a fluke last season. The Colts should be better this year, at least a little. That's enough to take a weak division.
Yeah. I am not sure about Kansas City in the AFC West.
I don't think they get back. Alex Smith is unspectacular, and I can't see that defense being as good this season.
The AFC North teams should be better. I could see Baltimore and Cincinnati getting the Wild Card spots.
Could be, but the AFC East won't get any Wild Cards. Miami got lucky last season.
They did. So did Detroit in the NFC North.
That they did. I doubt they get back into the playoffs.
Me too.But Green Bay should win that division again.
Agreed. Chicago is a disaster and Minnesota will be worse without Adrian Peterson.
The NFC East could get three playoff spots.
Yeah, it could. Dallas should win the divison again, and the Giants are good enough to return to the playoffs.
Yep. And Washington should be improved enough to contend for the Wild Card.
If they don't get it, I think Tampa Bay could - assuming they don't beat out the Falcons for the NFC South title.
Yeah, Jameis Winston look like he will be great, and soon.
The NFC West is Seattle's to lose.
Yep, and I can't see any Wild Card teams from that division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best defense in NFL history?
I would have to say one of the Steelers 1970's teams. But, I wasn't around when those defenses played.
I would definitely agree. They had many Hall of Famers on that roster.
Jack Ham, Lambert, Mean Joe Greene. Yes, they were a great bunch.
What is the best defense you have seen since watching football.
The 2000 Baltimore Ravens and it isn't even close.
That defense was insane.
It definitely was. It was so insane that they went 5 games without scoring a touchdown, and won 3 games during that stretch.
Did they really go 3 and 2 without scoring a touchdown.
They did. I believe that was when the coaching staff made the switch at quarterback to Trent Dilfer.
Who was the quarterback in there before the switch?
Tony Banks, I believe. He was atrocious as well.
I remember him. He was pretty bad.
That offense was inept at best. Amazing that a team could have that bad of an offense and still win the Super Bowl.
Goes to show you how good that defense really was.
It wasn't a very young defense either.
No, it wasn't. Ray Lewis was a lot younger, but they had veterans all over that defense.
I was so happy to see Rod Woodson get a Super Bowl ring.
The guy had a great career and he deserved to be a part of that special team.
He definitely did. He's still a Steeler at heart, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think Aaron Rodgers is going to do this year?
Oh, about the same as usual
So, you don't think his breakup with Olivia Munn is going to affect his play?
No, I think he is pretty much over her
How do you think the Packers are going to do as a team?
Well, I hope they do well.
Yes, I do also, with free agency you never know how the rookies will do
Isn't that the truth.
The Pack was one game away from the Superbowl last year, what a shame
Yes, Let's hope that they can pull it off this year.
I don't know, the way the Patriots seem to cheat all the time, seems to always be about them.
Isn't that the truth, maybe Brady will retire some day.
I don't know, he seems like he still has some years ahead of him.
Yeah, I guess
Let's just hope the Pack can go all the way.
I hope so, I am so excited for football season to start.
So, I am, I am really excited for this year.
I just hate that the Pack always have those late games.
Me too, hard to watch and then have to get up early the next day
I hear ya.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think has the best and worst uniforms in the NFL?
Best uniforms? I would have to say the Lions do.
The Lions? That's an obscure choice.
I like the Blue and Silver combination and their new logo is classic with a slight design change.
That upgrade in logo was hardly noticeable. Sometimes those are the best upgrades.
For certain. When a team goes crazy with a totally new logo, it sometimes loses it's feel.
What do you think is the worst uniforms in the NFL.
An obvious answer would be the Browns, because of the colors. However, I would say the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
At least they don't have those old creamsicle orange uniforms.
I disagree. Those uniforms were awesome. They were outrageous but they worked.
Did you like the old logo with the Buccaneer and the sword in his mouth.
I actually did. It wasn't intimidating at all and he winked, but it was detailed and unique and separated itself in that category.
That's surprising because most people hated their old logo and uniforms. Why do you hate their new uniforms?
I don't care for their new logo and their logo is oversized on the helmet.
Is it oversized. I didn't even notice.
It is. Take a look next time they are on television. I also hate the color pewter or whatever they call that.
It is an ugly color. What else don't you like about their uniforms.
The numbers look like they belong on an old 1980's microwave.
I could see that. They have that microwave or even alarm clock feel.
They need to go back old school and bring back the old uniforms.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, I can't wait for football season!
Me too! Its going to be a great year for receivers.
Why do you say that?
It seems that offense has been ruling the NFL the past few seasons.
That's true.  Who do you think has the best group of receivers?
The Giants, for sure!
No way! Look at the Patriots this year!
Dude, they are only good because of Brady!
No way! Edelman would hold his own on any team.
That is true, he is shifty.
Brandon Cooks is a beast! He broke 1000 yards and 8 touchdowns in both of the last two seasons!
Wow, that really is impressive.
Yeah it is! and on top of that they have Hogan and Mitchell, both of which have proven they can play.
Yeah maybe you are right, that is a pretty good receiver corps.
The Giants only have Odell anyway.
What about Brandon Marshall?
He is to old now, maybe five years ago he would have made them better.
I think the Jets made him look bad last year.
Yeah, they really did! The Jets made everyone look bad last year!
Yeah, everybody on their team. They made their opponents look great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Tom Brady should retire?
Why do you think that.
I think he is getting up there in his age.
I agree he may put ome strain on himself.
Peyton Manning is his age too luckily he realized.
Yeah I think he could get hurt.
They all should retire earlier.
I agree you never know what could happen.
I think that the Falcons are going to do better than them this year.
Really why.
Did you see how they played last year?
They were good.
I think they can get to the Superbowl again.
I think the Cowboys will.
Yeah they could.
It could end up between them two.
Wow never thought of that.
that would be a good game.
Yeah both teams are awesome.
Could not agree more with you on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which NFL teams do you think will make it to the Super Bowl in 2018?
Wow. I hadn't thought about that yet. I guess I can see the Patriots making it again.
What about the Falcons?
I don't know about them. Last year was kind of a fluke for that team.
Well, I wouldn't call it a fluke. More like a Cindarella story.
Kind of like the Cubs making it to the World Series.
Not quite that dramatic, but it was a surprise.
I don't see the Falcons making it all the way again this coming year.
I guess we'll see. What about the Broncos?
Not without Manning. Probably not, anyway.
How about the Seahawks?
Yeah, maybe. They're a great team.
They won the Super Bowl a few years ago.
Who did they beat in that game?
Denver. The Broncos.
Oh, right! They stomped them. I think a lot of people lost money betting on the Broncos.
So true. Everyone was surprised, I think.
Except maybe hardcord Seattle fans.
Of which I am one. I love the Seahawks.
Well, maybe a Seahawks/Patriots matchup will be in store for us in 2018.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Steelers "Steel Curtain" defense?
I was too young to watch them, but I've heard of them.
Yeah, they were pretty famous back in the day.
Who were some of the players in that group?
Jack Lambert, Mean Joe Greene, Mel Blount.
Oh, Joe Greene. He was in that famous Coke commercial right?
Yeah, that's the one. Really famous commercial.
Did they win a lot of Super Bowls.
Yes, four back in the 70s.
Wow, first team to four wins?
Yes. I remember the third one was Super Bowl XIII.
Who did they play back then?
Dallas Cowboys.
Oh, I bet that was a big rivalry
Yeah, they played each other a few times in the Super Bowl.
Wow, I beat it was intense to watch.
Yeah, I didn't see it live, but I've seen clips from NFL films.
I'll have to check those out.
Yeah, the Steel Curtain was a dominant force
I bet they were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL team?
I am a Denver Broncos fan.
Denver? Really?
Yes. I have been since John Elway was quarterback.
That was a long time ago.
I was probably 8 or 9 when I started following them.
I bet you were happy when they hired Payton Manning.
Not really I don't like the guy.
Who doesn't like Payton Manning?
Me apparently. I just think he is an amazing football player but he is a crappy person.
Really? Why do you think that?
Do you remember when he was out for the year from the Colts with neck surgery?
That was the same year his brother Eli won the superbowl right?
Yes. When his brother won it was a major accomplishment.
It was and I was glad to see he won.
So was the nation but instead of letting his brother bask in that glory and allowing him to celebrate his accomplishment, Payton made it all about him.
What do you mean?
Payton was in front of every camera he could find talking about his contract with the Colts. It took the spotlight away from Eli which was sad.
Isn't that just sibling rivalry?
Maybe but Denver capitalized on it an Payton fueled the fire so to say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What NFL stadium is the coolest?
I think the Eagles stadium is pretty neat.
How so?
Well, they've got incredible food and seating.
Did they just build that stadium?
Not too long ago.
When did it open?
Well, it was built in 2001, and it was renovated in 2013 and 2014.
That is pretty recent.
They have Wi-Fi and update score boards there.
That is cool.
What do you like best about the upgrades?
I think the seating is fantastic with great views of the game.
Can you see the cheerleaders?
You can see it all.
That's neat.
I hope to take my kids to a game sometime.
That would be fun.
It's a dream of mine to have my son play in the NFL.
Must be a common dream.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think is the most underrated team in the NFL?
The Miami Dolphins.
Why do you think so?
They have a chance to beat every team.
Then why are they underrated?
Maybe because they are overlooked because they can't compete with the Patriots.
What are the top players in that team?
They have a promising quarterback and running back.
And who are they?
Quarterback Ryan Tanehill and running back Jay Ajayi.
Is that all?
They have a decent offensive line.
What about their defense?
It can be better but it does have many play makers.
Such as?
Ndamukong Suh and Cameron Wake.
They made some great plays last season.
And many more to come.
So do you think they have a shot at the playoffs?
Playoffs?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are those Panthers looking this year?
Oh, you know we're gonna Keep Pounding!
We'll see. Is Cam up to the challenge?
I think so. He was hurt last year a lot of the time.
That's true. But it did start off poorly too.
Yeah, but he got hurt, I think in the season opener in Denver.
He needs to spend less time on Nick and more time studying the game.
I agree. There's a reason Brady doesn't have a TV show.
Exactly. It takes hard work to be a champ!
I think Cam can take them all the way though. We saw what he's capable of two years ago.
That was a great season indeed.
Oh yeah, if they had won... easily top 3 team of all-time.
I agree. Sucks that they lost.
At least they didn't lose like the Falcons though.
Amen to that!
That L was so bad, it made me feel better about the Cam's previous loss.
Tell me about. Blowing a 25 point deficit.
Yeah. That's some special incompetence.
Either that or Brady is just a god.
Well, yeah... Brady's definitely the greatest of all-time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, who do you think is the best receiver in the NFL?
Oh man that's tough there's some good ones.
Oh man that's tough there's some good ones.
Yeah I think I got it down to Bryant, AJ Green, Julio Jones, and Beckham.
Yeah I think those are all good, I take AJ Green out though.
Yeah I think those are all good, Id take AJ Green out though.
Why not AJ Green?
Why not AJ Green?
I think he's really good, I just don't think he offers some skills such as running after the catch, like the other guys do.
I think he's really good, I just don't think he offers some skills such as running after the catch, like the other guys do.
That's a good point.
And Julio Jones can be a stud, but sometimes I think his hands are a little bit suspect.
Yeah but he's such a force physically.
No doubt. Beckham might have the best hands of the bunch.
I'd  he has the most talented hands, but not the best hands.
Yeah I guess he does seem to drop a lot of easy balls.
Right, really I think that does leave those bryant as the best receiver.
Yeah I hate to say that because he's a cowboy though.
Yeah I hate acknowledging that any cowboy is good.
Their fans are just so annoying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you get excited about watching NFL games on TV?
I guess a little.  It depends on who's playing.
I know what you mean.  I used to like watching a lot, but I wasn't ever a die-hard fan.
I like watching the Cowboys.  We used to go to their games when I was younger.
Going in person is so much better then watching on TV.
Yes.  The atmosphere in the stadium is so different.
I have to say that I always liked going to football watching parties.
Yes.  Those are always fun.  I especially like SuperBowl parties.
I really get into those.
Do you have a favorite player?
I always liked Emmitt Smith.  He was such a class act.
I agree.  I liked him, but I was never a real fan of Michael Irvin or Deon Sanders.
They were both such showboats.
I can't say that I really know a lot of the players now.
Yes.  I doesn't seem like there's enough time to sit and watch too much.
I still think the games are exciting.  I just watch more for a team to win.  I don't pay too much attention to most of the players.
I think when I had kids, I didn't have enough time to keep up with it, and now I just haven't taken the time again.
Maybe this fall you can get back into it.
Sounds good.  Maybe I'll have some parties and get back into it again.
Sounds good.  I'll bring some chips and dip.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe the Patriots are still winning after all these years.
Yeah, it's embarrassing that they just won't get bad.
Well, cheating will do that for you.
Oh, we're way past the cheating scandals.
But it's funny that they keep finding out new ways they game the system.
They might take advantage of certain things, but that didn't make them win the SB.
That was an epic comeback no doubt.
Probably the greatest comeback in NFL history I think.
I won't argue that.  World's biggest stage, down 25 points...
Even late in the third quarter, you kind of thought they might have a shot.
It helps that you have Tom Brady.
Greatest QB ever.
I didn't think so at one time, but I'm not sure I can argue otherwise.
Guy's ancient, like 40 years old, but he's still in his prime.
He's just a great player.
No, greatest.  He may not have the records, but he's got the rings.
It's always funny how they have scrubs for WR's.
Right, but they somehow still come up time after time.
I guess that's the aura of the coaching staff for you.
Yep, best in the league in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite NFL team?
I'm a Cowboys fan. You?
Ugh I hate the Cowboys!
Yeah I hear that a lot. So what is your reason?
I just hate all the attention they get!
Well that is true I suppose. So what team do you follow?
I really like the Patriots. They have been on a really good run.
Ah yeah they have. Are you from New England?
No I'm from out west.
How long have you been a Pats fan?
Just a few years. I didn't follow football as a kid.
Really? I've been a Cowboy's fan my whole life! I remember watching them win with Emmit Smith!
Who is Emmit Smith?
Ugh, and you call yourself a football fan? He holds the record for most rushing yards in a career.
Huh, I did not know that.
Emmit Smith won 3 Superbowls with the Cowboys in the 90's.
When is the last time they won a Superbowl?
The 90's.
Man, it must have been a tough 20 years for Cowboy's Fans.
Yeah, I can assure you it has been tough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would've ever thought that sports can be scruitinized in such details?
Well, we do love knowing a lot about sports. We need history, stats, the last time this happened, that happened etc
But we don't even analyze the inancial markets in such details.
Of course we do. Balcks scholes equation is a stochastic differential equation that models the options pricing.
Can we do something similar for the NFL?
Someone probably already has done it. But what's the point Black Schole equation doesn't work.
Which is why the LTCM went bankrupt. But if we know why it doesn't work, then we can make it work for the NFL and predict the games.
Toss a coin, that's the simple version of the Black Scholes. it will win half the time at least
Haha. You think you're so funny
Anyway, so the ratings, yeah. It's got some issues, but gives us a great correlation as to who the better player is.
But better players do not always win the game, so what's the point?
Ugh, like I said, it's a guideline. That's all. It just feels better than betting blindly.
Might as well bet blindly, if it only gives you the trends and guidelines.
No. It helps a lot.
You know would be cool?
Oh boy, here we go again
I want a surface graph of total offense that rate 3 dimensions. Run efficiency, reception efficiency, and one more...
um... how are you defining the efficiencies?
Run efficiency would be runs attempted divided by yards gained.
The NFL already has this. It's called average yards gained by run. For the individual players as well as for the team. Only thignn new would be to put that in a graph. but you can't it's just one number for each
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
I am sure, I'm excited for what is coming up.
Who do you think will get to the super bowl this year, besides the obvious in the Patriots.
I wouldn't be so sure about them. I think the Raiders may have a chance
Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that debacle near the end of last year.
It's unfortunate we didn't get to see what Carr could do in the playoffs.
He's really turning into an amazing quarterback at such a young age.
The Raiders definitely struck gold on that kid.
Struck gold and are paying him in diamonds based on that contract they recently gave him.
That was a hefty one, but definitely worth it.
Given their history of bad quarterbacks since Gannon they definitely don't want to let him ever go.
He's definitely a raider for life as long as he stays healthy.
I do think they could be a contender. That defense looks like it could compliment that offense finally.
They definitely have improved on the defensive side.
It won't be easy to overthrow the Patriots though.
It never really is. They continue to be the number one team and it isn't even close.
It boggles my mind how they managed to become even better than their superbowl roster had.
It's scary how obnoxiously good the staff is from top to bottom. They always pick the right guys it seems.
It bothers me even more, because Brady looks like he is getting better with age.
I thought he was joking when he said he wants to play until he's 50, but honestly he's making me a believer year by year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for football season to start.
Me too! Who do you think will be good this year?
I think the Steelers might be able to make a Super Bowl run.
Interesting. They'll have to keep Big Ben healthy for once.
Agreed. I also think the Packers can win the Super Bowl.
I don't think that they have a good enough defense to make it.
Yeah, it needs to be better but they do have Aaron Rodgers.
He always gives you a chance. What do you think about the Falcons?
I think they'll take a step back. I'm still surprised they made to the Super Bowl.
They really blew that game. I also think they won't make it back.
I am interested to see how the Cowboys do this year.
Me too! I was surprised by how well Dak Prescott played.
I'm afraid him and  Elliot will have a Sophomore Slump and they'll miss Romo.
What about the Patriots? They could repeat.
True. It's hard to bet against Brady.
He's just too good.
If I had to put money on it, I'd pick the Patriots to win it again.
Good bet but I would take a chance on a sleeper.
Who would be your sleeper?
I would pick the Broncos.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Got your fantasy team set up?
Not yet. I will be doing such soon. I am stilled baffled that the season's almost here.
What is the one thing you are most looking to find out this season.
I really want to see what happens with the Seahawks overall.
They have had some serious controversy huh?
Yeah it seems like every season some report about their locker room comes out.
What happened before this recent report again?
They said that Wilson didn't have the support of the locker room.
How could you not support someone like him?
I don't know. The guy plays his heart out despite being like 5'10" max.
He puts it all on the field regardless if he is injured or his line is porous.
I can't agree with that. Now we have reports about Sherman.
Weren't they actually actively trying to trade him?
I think the Seahawks admitted to dangling him.
You don't find a lot of great corners. You can't just give one out or attempt to.
He didn't have as good of a season last year, but the guy can still play at a high level.
Yeah. The team definitely showed that they are completely ripe for the pickings when Earl Thomas is out.
Yeah. Shows that Sherman isn't the best on his team, but he's still great.
They have a tendency to start slow too, so a record below .500 early in could definitely stir some things up.
Yeah I know. It's going to be interesting to observe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think I'd be a great NFL announcer.
You'd be horrible
Thanks!
Why do you think you'd be so great?
I'd be beyond literal in the play calling.
How so?
Imagine John Madden.
Eww. Enough.
Come on. John Madden but insanely literal.
Example?
Ask me a question you hear a lot.
"What do the Colts have to do to beat the Patriots today?"
I'd say "They have to score more points."
That's lame, a bit more?
"They have to stop New England on the offensive and score when in the red zone."
Haha, that's exactly what they're like.
Literal, sounds smart, but is insanely stupid.
Know what's crazy?
What?
They get paid a TON of money to state the obvious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched LeGarrett Blount score three rushing touchdowns in the Eagles game
When was that?
Its was a repeat from a broadcast last year when they played against the New England Patriots
Must have been a pretty good game
Yes and LeGarrett Blount has pretty good stats
Isn't he their star quarterback,
No he's the running back!
Yeah but he's built more like a line backer
Yeah a guy that big - nobody is gonna get in his way
I know he has really good stats
Yes pretty impressive
Is he your favorit player?
Well for that particular team maybe
I thought you must be really impressed by him to watch a rebroadcast
Well actually I had to work that day it aired so I didn't see it live
I see.
I'm looking forward to seeing him play this year
Me too. He really is impressive with his moves
You may come to like the whole team
Maybe, though I always preferred the Falcons
XXXXXXXXXXX
The fall season is months away and you know what that means
Another season of some football?
That's right. Another season of me hoping anyone but the patriots win.
You can say that again. I don't think I can stomach another repeat of that last Superbowl.
Do you think there are any sleeper teams who could dethrone them this season?
I legitimately think that the Giants could.
Really? Tell me more.
Well their defense is a top 10 defense and Brady always seems to struggle against such.
What about the Giants' offense? They struggled mightily.
That is one of the main things that makes it a huge gamble if I were a betting man.
I know their offensive line was bad last year, but jeez Eli looked pretty bad too.
Their running game could definitely use some help too.
They don't need to be a top running team to be a threat. It just has to be a threat to the opposing defense somewhat.
Yeah. Any kind of running game would make their receivers even more of threat.
Hopefully they do make the necessary changes. If they do then I definitely agree with what you are saying.
Odell is always a big factor as well.
Yeah, his mental toughness is almost non-existant
He is such an amazing receiver. All these antics need to stop.
Even the front office said they were tired of it and that he needs to mature.
He does or else he is going to end up being the next Terrell Owens and universally hated and ringless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm curious. Does every state have their own football team?
No. Only 22 states have football teams.
That means less than half of the states in the United States have teams.
You're correct.
But it seems like there are more than 22 teams.
There are. Some states have more than one team.
Which state has the most?
California has more teams than any other state.
How many teams does it have?
It has four teams altogether.
I know it has the 49ers and Raiders. What are the other teams?
It also has the Rams and the Chargers.
What are some of the states that don't have teams?
Alabama, Nevada, Oregon and Alaska.
I guess Alaska makes sense because of the weather.
Alaska actually had an indoor football team at one time that was known as Alaska Wild.
Were they part of the NFL or AFL?
No. They were a part of Intense Football League.
Are they still around?
No. They played their last game in 2010.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, I can't wait for this NFL season to start.
Yeah, the draft this year was amazing and a lot of teams look really good on paper. Especially our Philadelphia Eagles.
YES! Derek Barnett I think was a great pickup in this years draft. He is the next Reggie White.
I'm more excited on the offensive side myself.
Who are you most excited about that we picked up?
Obviously Alshon Jeffrey. This guy can flat out play, I just hope he doesn't get hurt like he usually does.
I think their best pickup was LeGarrett Blount. How we picked him up without any issues is beyond me.
Yeah he was definitely a great pickup. I believe he has the most touchdowns for all running backs last year.
Well you can't deny the power and presence of this guy. Very intimidating indeed.
Yeah most definitely.
I'm just glad Carson Wentz has more weapons to his arsenal now.
Not only did we get two big name acquisitions, we also picked some great role players both in the draft and free agency.
I think Wendell Smallwood will be a key player in the offense.
Yeah, I don't think Sproles can handle a full load for the team. He is great but needs breaks.
I just hope our defense comes up big for us. I don't think we did enough to shore up our holes in that secondary
Well, Malcom Jenkins should have another great year. Sidney was a good draft pick, and the line up front should release some of the pressure of the secondary.
I just hope no one gets hurt. That's what hurt the team the most the last couple years.
Well, I dunno what it is, but we as a team in whole tend to have a lot of key injuries.
Well let's hope no injuries this year.
Agreed!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the best teams in the AFC going into this season?
Well, Denver has the best defense, but no franchise quarterback. So their good but not top contenders.
Who else?
Without injury the Oakland Riders would have done even better this year.
Does Oakland still have a team?
Yeah, but Las Vegas is building a tow billion dollar stadium for them to play in within the next three years.
But right now they're still in Oakland?
That's right and they have a good team.  If Carr had not gotten hurt, they might have been in the AFC championship game.
What other teams are good?
Kansas City is consistently good and Baltimore should not be counted out. But they're not the best teams.
Who are the best teams?
The Pittsburgh Steelers and the New England Patriots?
Why?
Both teams have franchise quarterbacks which is one of the most important factors.
I agree, you need at least a good quarterback to win in the playoffs.  What else makes them good.
Both teams are proven winners and both teams are well coached.
So who comes out on top?
Well, New England is the team to beat, but the Steelers have an even better chance than they did last year.
And don't forget about Las Vegas, I mean Oakland right?
Yeah, I would not count out the Raiders, might come down to the inevitable, whoever stays the healthiest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Green Bay Packers will be able to bounce back this season?
I think the Green Bay Packers will be in it every season as long as Aaron Rodgers is healthy and playing.
So Aaron Rodgers or Matt Ryan as best current quarterback in the league?
How can you exclude Tom Brady from that debate?
I'm not, I'm just bringing up a scenario where it's excluding Tom Brady because we know he's a future Hall of Famer.
Okay fair enough. I think Aaron Rodgers over Matt Ryan as best current quarterback by a large margin.
Why do think that? Matt Ryan has shown he's very capable and he's even made the Superbowl.
Matt Ryan did, but he fell short. Aaron Rodgers already is a champion and Superbowl MVP.
That's a good point. Until Matt Ryan wins a Superbowl I guess it's hard to put them on the same level.
Exactly, he has to prove himself a champion before he can be compared to a champ.
I don't know by that statement you could say that Eli Manning is a better quarterback then Aaron.
That's a good point. It seems like when we compare who's better than who we use Superbowl rings as a marker unless it's someone we feel is less talented.
Yeah seems to be always the case, but there's a fair argument that can go both ways.
I stand by my choice of Aaron Rodgers over Matt Ryan but I'm not discrediting Matt Ryan's achievements so far. He has a bright future.
It helps when you have Julio Jones to throw passes to!
I'm just wondering if Matt Ryan will have the same opportunities next season now that Kyle Shanahan the offensive coaching mastermind has left for the San Francisco 49ers.
I think the Atlanta Falcons will retain a lot of his playbook and I'm sure Matt has picked up a lot from the past seasons to be competent enough to continue with his success.
I can see that. Now I'm wondering if Aaron Rodgers can keep performing like he has.
I think the Green Bay Packers will look even better this year. They're going to be healthier and they've added more weapons.
I'm looking forward to it as you know Aaron Rodgers is my favorite current NFL quarterback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's up with your boy kaepernick?
what you mean?
do you think someone will sign him this season?
i don't know. maybe.
i don't think he ever plays in the league again.
that's because of the dumb stuff that comes out of his mouth.
naw, that's because he's garbage.
man, he led the niners to the super bowl that year.
that was like almost five years ago. he hasn't done anything since.
who'd he get benched for in san fran?
some bum. i don't remember his name.
yeah, the forty-niners are a mess.
and i think they got another new head coach this season.
yeah. chip kelly, one and done.
kelly ain't n f l material.
neither is kaepernick.
i don't think either one of them will be in the league this season.
well i know chip kelly won't. i think he signed up for fox tv or one of them networks.
yeah. he might do that for a season and then head back to coaching.
in the colleges, not the pros.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Seattle run Lynch up the middle?
eck no they did a fake reverse handoff throw back to Russel Wilson to get down to the 5.
First play after the fumble. I mean, That's creative play calling right there.
If it hadn't been for denvers safety, the only guy who wasn't fooled, it would have been an easy TD.
I've seen a lot of creativity from a lot of teams, especially in the red zone.
i would always scratch my head wondering why can't the Texans do that.
We were so basic and predictable.
The only creative play was that wide receivers screen to Fuller in week 2.
Wasn't O'Brien the offensive co-ordinator at Patriots?
i  think so. It would be interesting to watch video of their plays near the line to see what O'Brien might be aiming for if he gets the QB capable of the required throws.
The line is a big part of it but the QB can help the line out big time by getting rid of the ball faster - enter Watson.
Osweiler and Savage are both a bit slow at getting rid of it.
Two fresh and dangerous backs will also add some firepower.
I think the offense will be better and likely improve from week to week - barring key injuries.
Fido will likely be our big bodied receiver near the line.
The reason why the O was so bad can be summarized in a word; Brock.
He didn't know the system well and in general he is just not that good. That's why Fitz and Hoyer (to name 2) played better at QB.
The OL is still the biggest question, secondary being second.
No good OL play will mean QB play won't be as good as it can be.
The running game will not have the impact it should with Foreman and Miller.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the opening day for the Titans this season?
I have no idea. I know it's in the beginning of September..
Okay, I'll look up. I want to check the schedule anyway. I'm so excited about them this season.
You think Mariota is 100% now?
I'd imagine so. He is still a young player and I heard that break was a clean one. Easy to mend.
That's good to hear...I like him too.
Yeah, when I lived in Hawaii, all locals were so proud of him. I kind of share the feeling.
It's a pretty good team all in all...done well last year.
I know, they surprised us all, didn't they?
Much like the Raiders?
Oh, yeah! What was up with that?
Maybe they are showing up so they can move to Vegas...
haha...that maybe! Vegas would be better than Oakland!
Oh, and the Vikings did well, too.
Yes! my boyfriend was so happy about that! He's from St. Paul.
Oh, I bet he hate the Packers then!
Of course! Just like how I don't like the Falcons...
It's okay, no body much care about the Falcons.
I am really hoping for a great season for the Titans.
Good luck! I don't think they are quite ready for the Superbowl, but who knows....
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never know what to make of the NFC Central. Do you?
They used to call them the Black and Blue division because of how gritty they were.
Maybe nobody's gritty anymore. I don't know.
So you think the Packers will win that division?
I'm not sure there's much to stop them. They got Aaron Rodgers.
Rodgers kind of gets me. Great numbers all the time but only one Super Bowl ring.
That could describe a lot of QBs, I guess.
I guess so but is it him or the team?
Maybe they haven't put a good enough team around him.
I thought you'd say that. Or maybe he's just not the winner he's cracked up to be.
It's not like the heyday with Bret Favre.
That's for sure. And Mike Holmgren as coach.
Yeah, after Holmgren left it kind of left with him.
They should have let him have the general manager job and been coach too, then he would have stayed.
Yeah, I never understood why they didn't.
That west coast offense, he developed a lot of that stuff.
Yeah, but you know then he went to Seattle and I don't think he did so well there.
You're right. I guess you've always got to find the right combination.
Like Landry and Staubach in Dallas.
Yeah, or Belachick and Brady in New England.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your opinion of the Washington Redskins?
I don't have much of an opinion on them.
How about an opinion on Kirk Cousins?
Could have played better this season.
It is never good to have less touchdowns and more interceptions.
Exactly I wonder if the Redskins will give him another chance.
They should give him another season.
Yeah I mean he did put up more then 20 touchdowns the past two years.
Even if he did that again while lowering his interceptions that would be great progress.
He must be wanting to do that.
Hopefully he works really hard this offseason.
I am sure he will put in a lot of effort this offseason.
I hope he does especially if he gets traded to a team in need of a Quarterback.
Yeah if the Redskins snub him he can get his revenge with a great season somewhere else.
I would love to see that next year.
To be honest I will watch Redskins games when I can.
Same here I usually try to watch as many games as I can.
We are both big football fans.
Well maybe the Redskins will win the Superbowl next year.
If they do that will be great for the city of Washington!
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's that new cheating stuff they talking about in the n f l?
what you talking about?
i heard something going on with what the colts were doing one season.
i think i heard something about that. you mean with the earplugs?
yeah.
i think one of their ex players recently told a reporter or somebody about how they would use earplugs to block out the noise.
yeah. he was saying something about a hearing aid i though?
naw. it was earplugs.
and they always accusing the patriots of cheating.
that's because they do. i can't stand new england.
all they do is win partner. stop hating.
and all you do is run with the front runners.
what
yeah. who you like this season?
the patriots.
my point exactly.
dude, i been rocking with the patriots ever since old boy got hurt.
who?
the dude that tom brady replaced.
oh, you're talking about drew bledsoe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, I agree that the Seahawks have been trending downward, but they are still really good.
Yea, they still have Russell Wilson.
Would you want to count on him?
Yea, I think so. He has proven enough.
Yea, he seems to improvise a lot, but he is very good at it.
Yea, when their play breaks down, he's great at making things happen.
Yea, well he is a former baseball player. He is quick.
Yea, thats the beauty of having a mobile quarterback.
Yea, the only bad part is that it could potentially expose them to injury.
Yea, it could, but he has been fairly lucky so far.
Yea, I agree. Thats the good part.
Yea, its nice.
Yea, I do not even know who their backup is though if he were to get injured.
Me either. Thats a scary thought.
Yea, it absolutely is. They better hope that doesn't become reality.
Yea, I hope not. He's a good player.
Yea and they need him to win.
Its the Russell and defense show in Seattle usually.
Yea, thats how they win. Its refreshing.
Yea, we'll see if they are able to keep doing it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the most popular player in the NFL right now?
Geez thats a tough one to think of
Would you think Tom Brady
I mean yeah who else could you even say?
I think Drew Brees is one of them
Hes a popular QB but even that is waning I am sure.
Yeah thats true I guess I dont know who I would surmise
You could also probably name any Dallas player
Elliot has top jersey sales
Yeah and I am sure Prescott is on his way there
That would be amazing with Bryan too
Yeah they arent called Americas team for nothing
Speaking of that I hate that nickname
Well it wasnt organic thats why people have a problem with it
Is anything that team does organic?
No I know what you are saying
But back to popularity would you say Antonio Brown
Yeah his antics have him up there
I love his celebrations
They may be making a comeback this year
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Marie!
How you doing Bob?!
I'm good.. did you get a chance to watch the superbowl over the weekend?
Yes I did even thought I am not a fan of football..
Really? but what makes you watch the Superbowl then?
I love just watching the half-time show and the commercials
What did you like about the half-time show this year?
I am a really big fan of Lady Gaga -- she is such a talented artist
I'm not really a fan of hers :(
Did you at least enjoy the commercials?
Well the ones I saw? I mean thats my time for bathroom break haha
yeah of the ones you saw which did you like?
I liked the one showing the history of the Beer company.. it made me really think about the fact we are all immigrants
oh yeah that was really meaningful given the timing
Yep
My husband said that the game was good -- according to his standards
Oh yeah the Patriots MUSHED the falcons!!!
Wow MUSHED EH?!
Yeah.. well lets see who they have next year for the halftime show and we can talk about it then
Sure! Good deal!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the toughest division in the NFL?
I would have to say right now it is the AFC West.
You got a lot of good teams there.
Denver has an awesome defense.
Oakland had an awesome team.
They did until David Carr got hurt.
Yeah.  They ended up losing to Houston in the playoffs.
Kansas City is usually tough.
Arrowhead Stadium is a tough stadium to play in as a visitor.
It is usually one of the lowest stadiums in the league.
Andy Reid is a good coach.
San Diego can come up and surprise people.
They have had a lot of good years in the past decade.
They had an explosive offense.
I would also say that the NFC East can be tough.
Yeah Dallas should be a great team again.
The New York Giants always play people tough.
They do and they seem to catch fire in the playoffs.
Odell Beckham is probably the best receiver in the game.
Washington and Philadelphia can make the playoffs too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch a lot of football?
I do, but there aren't any major teams out here.
What football do you watch then?
I watch a lot of college football. This is a college town, after all.
Hmm, I really don't know if I can get into that.
Why not?
Well, I think the skill level is just much better in the NFL.
It definitely is.
Right. And the athletes get paid more money.
They do. So what team do you root for?
Well, I really like the Seahawks.
Why the Seahawks?
I'm from Seattle, so it's a hometown pride sort of thing.
They've also done really well the past few years.
They have. Makes it easy to be a fan!
But you'd still be a fan if they were losing, wouldn't you?
I suppose I'd have to be.
It's hard to stop being a fan when you are one.
Exactly. It's a part of your life.
Can't get away from it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the upcoming season?
I always am.
Who do you think breaks out this year as a quarterback?
Marcus Mariota is my pick.
I will admit I thought coming out of Oregon he would have been a bust.
I think the Titans are glad they didnt trade the pick.
I agree and I think he has turned out to be a nice player
He just has to stay healthy.
Besides him, who else is primed for a huge year?
Not many because this year was not a great year for quarterbacks.
You mean in the draft?
Yeah there was no one who was a game changer.
Do you think Eli Manning is nearing the end?
Yes but he has OBJ to help ease that pain
I agree with you that it could happen.
The NFC East has alot of good quarterback this year.
Kirk Cousins does nothing for me
Theres a reason he keeps getting franchised
I mean yeah he does have alot of good qualities
But he doesnt win games that matter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So where did that guy play in college?
That guy... Yes because we all know who that guy is.
You know the one who scored highest on the Woderlic or whatever
Oh, Harvard. McInally was a punter and wider receiver for the Bengals.
What was his major?
I don't know. But he did graduate with a cum laude
Wow, that's a big deal. He really is a smart guy.
Smarts are needed in sports. A lot of the plays are very tricky and need smarts to execute them well. That's why NFL cares.
it makes you wonder how Claiborne can function at the level though
Maybe he just didn't care for the test much.
oh,. so like, he just didn't care and didn't even try hard?
Yeah, who knows.
I think I did hear that he said something like oh I blew that test off or something
Oh yeah. he said, "Nothing on that test came with football"
Hahaha. That's funny.
Well, he's an average player.
So maybe Wonderlic does predict performance.
Well, Frank Gore has the second lowest score at 6. he was a leading rusher for the 49ers for years.
Huh, he had 9 seasons with 1000 yards rushing.
That's whole lotta running with da ball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who will be the worst teams in the NFL in 2017?
I think the Browns will be bad... again.
Yes, that' a pretty safe bet.
I also think that the Jets will continue to be mediocre.
Do you think that the Chargers will bounce back?
Perhaps, but they need to overhaul their roster.
We will see, what about the Bears?
The Bears will get marginally better, but who knows.
I really hope that the 49ers return to dominance.
They have been garbage since Harbaugh was forced out.
Yeah, I'm not sure what happened there.
Bad management is what happened there.
At least he is successful at Michigan - he was a hell of an NFL coach.
They went to the Superbowl a few years after he joined the league.
Yes, that goes to show how great he is.
I think the 49ers will continue to be bad until they get a new staff.
They need a total rehaul of their culture.
The recent retirings definitely did not help.
That was unfortunate for fans, but good for those players.
I loved them - but we will see come this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL player?
Tough to say, current or all time?
Current first.
Wow that's really tough. I would have to say Odell Beckham.
Not a bad choice I suppose.
Why who would you pick?
Im joining the AP train.
Adrian Peterson? What has he done recently?
Just you wait and see.
We've all been waiting for a few years now, he hasn't been the same since the scandal.
He hasn't been on the right team either.
You think he is now?
I think the Saints are a better place for him to showcase his talents.
Maybe, but he is never going to be the same he used to be.
You don't know that, you only like Beckham because he's popular now.
That's not true, I like Beckham because he makes incredible plays look easy.
Almost none of those look easy.
The way he catches those balls they sure do.
At least Peterson is a tough guy who can take a hit.
Oh would you stop it, Beckham can take a hit too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Manning brothers?
I think they are a little overrated, actually.
What? I think they are both great players.
Don't get me wrong, they are, but like I said....they aren't the best.
Yeah, I agree there are better players then them.
I can't even remember their names, Peyton and....
Eli. Eli is the younger one.
Gotcha, I feel like they've been a part of the NFL forever.
They really have, I'm surprised they haven't retired yet.
Peyton is a part of the Patriots, right?
Yep, not sure what team Eli is on though.
They probably aren't on the same team, I'm assuming?
Probably not, conflict of interest maybe.
Well, all I'm saying is I'm sure they'll retire soon.
I feel like they'll play until they can't even walk.
How many superbowls have they been both in, do you think?
Oh, too many to count.
Well I know the Patriots just were in the Superbowl.
Yeah, and lost, if I remember correctly.
You remembered correctly indeed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are your opinions on legal steroid use for NFL players?
Heck, no. Why should that be allowed?
Because it would make the game more exciting.
I think that would be so wrong. I don't think athletes should be allowed to cheat like that.
But if it's legal, how would it be cheating? Everybody would be allowed to use it.
What about the players that don't want to use it?
Well, then that's their choice. They don't have to use it?
But that would make the playing field really dangerous for those who have no desire to use steroids.
Then they should consider using it. I think the game would be more exciting for fans to watch since there'd be better athletic peformances.
I think there already is great ahtleticism in football. We don't need to add steroids to the mix.
To me, there shouldn't be limitations to how the sport should progress. If athletes want to use steroids they should use it.
Like I said, it would be unfair to those who don't want to risk the dangers of steroids.
Personally, I think sports are more exciting when athletes are using steroids. Look at the home run derby between McGuire and Sosa years ago.
To me, if they have to use steroids to put on a show, then there's really nothing great about it.
I think you're being a little too judgemental about steroids. It isn't as dangerous as you think.
Even if what you say is true, just the fact that it's even a little dangerous is something some players don't want to deal with. And they shouldn't have to.
I just think the NFL is too soft these days. I want to see some hard hits again.
I think that has more to do with the rules than the lack of steroids.
Yeah, maybe. Maybe I just want to watch some old style football again.
That could be it. Plus, you never know which players just haven't gotten cauging using illegal substances, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following Christian Hackenberg since he's gone to the NFL?
Well, there isn't much to follow. He didn't even dress for games last year.
I guess I mean all the stories about him.
A few here and there. He was such a highly rated college prospect but it's looking like he may never play an NFL game.
Well, the Jets quarterback situation is pretty terrible so maybe he will have a shot.
I don't know. I used to think it was just his footwork that was bad, but I guess he has major accuracy issues too.
Neither of which do well in the NFL.
No, not at all. Maybe he'd do better as a Texan.
Why is that?
Well, Bill O'Brien was his college coach during his freshman year and that was the best year he had.
I don't know if O'Brien wants to risk another quarterback situation like he had before.
Oh, you mean the issues they had with Brian Hoyer?
No, he was just always hurt I think. I'm talking about Brock Osweiler.
Oh that's right. One good year for the Broncos and then he turned out terrible for Houston.
He really did. It is interesting how that can happen with some of these guys.
I'll be interested to see if Dak Prescott can be as good in his second season as he was as a rookie.
I think so. He seems like the real deal.
Well, when Tony Romo recognized it and basically stepped aside, I think that was telling.
Yeah. Romo just couldn't get passed all of his injuries.
Well, with the money he was making I'm not sure just how bad I feel for him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been thinking about NFL referees.
Having a pretty exciting day, are you?  I can't even name one.
Nobody can, except for the logo guy.
Jim Tunney?
Yeah, but I think he's retired, but what I wanted to say is they are part time workers--work on Sunday and go back to teaching high school math.
So,there's only one game a week--you want them to to work college, high school, and occasional Pop Warner games?
Very funny, but they could do film study and even promotional events.  As much as the NFL makes, they can afford to pay them for full-time.
O.K. I agree and you probably would get better officiating.
Yes, and the officiating is so crucial--a holding or pass interference call can determine the game.
You're right and speaking of pass interference, the pro rule should be changed.
How so?
Make it like college--a fifteen yard penalty, not spot foul.
Yeah, now there can be a 50 yard penalty on a long pass.  But how do you prevent a defender from tackling a receiver breaking free?
You don't; if it occasionally happens, it's a 15 yard penalty--no one can predict it would have been a touchdown.
You're right, maybe the quarterback doesn't see that receiver.
Or he overthrows him.
O.K--got any other rule changes?
Well, the illegal contact rule is tricky.
Yeah, no touching the receiver after the first five yards--I wish they'd call it consistently.
There you go--that's why you want full-time referees.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the start of the season!
Tell me about it, it feels so long since I've watched football.
Who are you rooting for?
I like the Baltimore Ravens
That's cool do you think they'll win it all this year?
I hope so, but I'm not sure.
What gives you doubts?
We seem to be in the rebuilding process and I'm not sure we're ready to take the prize, but I'm hopeful.
I am personally looking for the Eagles to do good things this year.
What makes you think that'll happen?
It looks like they finally got Wentz some receivers he can utilize.
I think it's going to take longer for them to gel.
I hope not. Wentz certainly has the talent.
I agree, but it's only his second year in the league.
I know, but there have been junior players that have lead teams to greatness in no time.
You're right, I'm just not certain they can make it happen.
Why do you say that?
It takes more than a QB and receivers to make things happen.
I agree our defensive and offensive lines could use some work.
I agree, but I hope your Eagles do well. I'd like to see my Ravens play them in the Super Bowl.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! I haven't seen you in a while!
Yeah, I moved to New York!
Nice! How do you like the New York Giants?
I've actually been able to see them play a few times.
That's pretty awesome.
I agree.
Where did you see them play?
I watched some home games, so they were at the Metlife Stadium.
Is that in New York?
Actually it is in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Why New Jersey?
They share the stadium with New York Jets, so I guess that must be where they agreed to?
You'd really think their stadium would be in New York, though.
For sure. I was surprised, too.
So how has the team been doing lately?
They're ranked third right now.
Behind who?
The Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears.
Clearly you're more up to date on the team than I am.
Clearly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite NFL team?
The Philadelphia Eagles?
Who won the last Superbowl?

Cleveland
Name a team in the NFC East
Dallas Cowboys

XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to make a bet on the upcoming NFL season?
What type of bet?
A bet on the playoff teams, the person who predicts the most correct teams gets fifty dollars.
Sure that sounds fun, I think the Patriots are the obvious pick we will both have.
Yeah, that is a foregone conclusion, they are pretty much guaranteed.
Are you picking your Jaguars to make it?
No, I want to win the money, they are not going to make the playoffs.
I see, head before heart.
Yes, well at least you don't have to worry, I think your Packers are in.
Yeah, I also think they have a good shot at the Super Bowl this year.
They probably do, I think they improved enough in the off season to be a favorite to win it all.
As long as Aaron Rodgers is there they have a shot at it.
He is a game changing type of player.
For sure, he also came up big in the second half of last season.
I can just imagine what he could do with a competent team around him.
Yeah give him a better coach like the Patriots and the Packers have a dynasty.
I do not doubt that at all.
So anyway want to up the bet, lets make it an even one hundred.
Yeah, I can live with that, this season is going to be even better because of the stakes.
I agree, it's been great talking football with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you going to be watching NFL this season?
Yeah, of course I have to see if the Raiders live up to the hype.
What hype do you mean?
Well, I'll be interested to watch Amari Cooper this season.
Even though the team is moving to Las Vegas?
Yeah, even so. I'll still be watching.
Why is that?
Well, they'll be wanting to move on a hot streak so it's important to see that they do.
What do you think about their quarterback?
Oh, I think Dereck Carr will be phenomenal this year.
Do you see anybody exemplary in the backfield?
Yeah I see a few players.
And who might they be?
Khalil Mack for one.
So you're just banking that the lineup they had last year pulls through?
Not just banking on it, counting on it.
I don't see how such a prediction can be made.
Well, without any injuries this season I think they'll be well-placed to make the playoffs.
And what about the fans in Oakland?
They'll have to get used to seeing the Raiders succeed on their way out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any NFL teams you route against?
Of course!
Really? I didn't take you as that much of a hardcore fan.
I'm more of a casual fan: I watch when it's on, but I don't care too much.
So who do you root against?
The Giants, the Jets, the Steelers, and the Cowboys.
Why those?
The Giants and Jets because in every sport I root against New York-based teams. That and I hate Eli Manning.
So why the Steelers? You're from Pennsylvania.
Right, the eastern side. Born a Philly fan.
But they're not even the same conference.
Yeah, but Big Ben is a horrible person who has been involved in accidents and a heck of a lot of sexual assaults.
Yeah, he's sketchy. So why America's team?
Precisely that. The arrogance of calling themselves America's team.
You probably hate the Super Bowl, then right?
How so?
Because the winner is the World Champion.
I HATE THAT SO MUCH.
Haha, I know you would.
American pro sports and arrogance go together so well, don't they. Especially the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Dallas Cowboys?
I like them a lot.
They have had 32 play off appearances.
They used the Cotton Bowl from 1960 - 1971.
Then they used Texas Stadium from 1971 - 2008.
Jerry Jones net worth is $5.2 billion.
When they joined the NFL there was no team south of DC.
During the 1970's they won 105 regular season games.
Danny White was quarter back in 1980.
That was after Rodger Staubach.
The 1982 season was short--player strike.
In the 1990's they got Daryl Johnston.
They got Emmitt Smith also.
I liked Erik Williams.
Darren Woodson was good also.
Michael Irvin was one of the best.
I think Nate Newton was the best.
Remember Jay Novaceck?
Yes, and there was also Charles Haley.
Those were the days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you a Steelers fan?
Not really, I don't mind them but I wouldn't say I'm a fan.
I really like Ben Rothlisberger.
I like Big Ben, too. He's a heck of a quarterback at times.
I guess they resigned Le'Veon Bell to a long contract.
I was hoping he would go somewhere else. They're always hard to beat when he plays well.
I wonder how the Cincinnati Bengals are going to do this year.
Probably the same as every year. Play great during the season, beat teams they shouldn't be able to beat, lose to teams they should be able to beat and then lose in the playoffs.
That's funny. Different year, same story.
Andy Dalton just never gets any better. He looks great and then folds.
I can think of a lot of quarterbacks who are like that.
Yes, like Ryan Fitzpatrick. He looks as good as anyone and then look like a really bad rookie.
Yep, I totally agree with you. I wonder what the Jets are going to do for a quarterback?
I don't know. They have a couple young quarterbacks but I don't know how good they are.
I just looked it up. They have Josh McCown too.
At least he has some experience. That will help.
I'm surprised they didn't go for Colin Kaepernick or Jay Cutler.
Well, I can understand. There's too much baggage with Kaepernick and Jay Cutler is not a team player.
You're probably right. Cutler is going to call games, isn't he?
Yeah, I guess they couldn't resist his great personality.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The football season is coming!  I am so pumped!
I can see that.
This is the time when I get to see my friends and relatives.
You are lucky that many of your friends and relatives like to watch football games.
Even friends and relatives who are not crazy about football games get together on most game days.
My brother is the only relative of mine who likes football.
Perhaps you can bring him to our house next time we throw a football party.
He will like that.
The more the merrier.
You have a nice big backyard.  It is suitable for parties.
I enjoy having football parties.
When I was at your party the last time, your guests seemed to have a great time.
I hope you had a good time too even though you hardly knew anybody else.
I had a great time.  Your friends were very nice and welcoming.
Next time, please bring your brother.
Thank you for the invitation.
I will be going to the first home game at Gillette Stadium with my dad.  I will throw a party at my house for the following game.  We can watch the game on TV.
It sounds like fun.
It will be fun and you are invited.
Thanks again for inviting me and my brother.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, are you excited about the new NFL season? I've had enough of trying to get into soccer, let me tell you...
Yeah, totally! It's the only sport I follow.
I don't blame you, there's way too much to follow otherwise.
What team do you root for?
Well you know I'm a Philly guy, so I'm all about the Eagles!
Yeah, I'm from Seattle so I gotta go for the Seahawks every time.
Woah, I didn't know that!
Yeah, I was in town for when they won the Superbowl in 2013. It was wild!
Yeah, like how?
Oh you know, I was up in the University District so people were practically rioting, but like, in a good way. Tons of great live music and cheering in the streets!
That's awesome, dude. How did you feel about the 2014 season though?
Oh God, don't even talk to me about that one! Superbowl XLIX was a rough one.
Yeah, it was 2005 all over again, you know? Isn't that the last time the Seahawks went to the Superbowl until the 2013 season?
Yup--I don't remember seeing it though, I was a pretty young teenager back then. Pretty sure Seattle wasn't too happy.
Being beat by Denver has to be pretty embarrassing too, right? I mean, you West Coast guys aren't really known for your football...
Hey now, Colorado isn't exactly West Coast! And you always gotta root for the under-dog. I'd do that even if I wasn't a Seahawks man myself...
Fair enough. Who do you think's the best guy on the Seahawks this year? Any favorite picks?
Russell Wilson's always been my man...I don't know too much about any up-and-coming guys this year, though. You?
I think Carson Wentz can beat out Russell Wilson as a quarterback any day, honestly. We don't have to trade around so much when we've got solid talent!
Ha ha, I guess we'll see about that then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My goodness, I cannot wait to see the Packers this season.
Will they win it all this year?
The Super Bowl? Rogers is in his prime, no on else in the NFC can come close to them.
What about the Cowboys?
The Packers beat the Cowboys last year.
I do remember that, yes.
What was the final score of that game?
It was 34 to 31. The kicker hit a last-second field goal to win the game.
Was that after the timeout.
Yes, yes it was.
That must have hurt Cowboys fans, to come to close and lose.
Yes, it probably did. That's what happens in football.
Absolutely. One team wins, the other loses.
That's what happened there.
Yes, the Packers moved on and the Cowboys did not.
That is an accurate assessment of the situation. Of course the Packers lost next week too.
Yes, they lost to the Falcons.
Who then lost to the Patriots in the Super Bowl.
That is what happened, yes.
Such is the life of the NFL. I don't think any sport is better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch NFL football?
A bit.  Why?
Who do you think the best quarterback is?
Out of any team?
Yeah, any team.
I'd have to say Drew Brees.
Wow.  I just think he's totally overrated.
What!?!  The guy holds tons of records!
I know he does.  I mean, his single season stats aren't on point lately.
He's still pretty awesome.
Seriously?  The Saints haven't done well in a while.
Well, maybe it's more the rest of the team than it is him.
Really?  The guy is getting old.
Look at how old Tom Brady is!
Tom Brady isn't that much older than Brees.
How much older is he?
Maybe two years.
Really?  I though it was more than that.
Probably because Tom Brady has been in the limelight for longer.
That could be it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL running back of all time?
There are so many including Walter Payton and Eric Dickerson but I'd have to go with Barry Sanders.
But he played on such a lousy team and never made it to the Super Bowl.
That's part of what makes him so great.  If Sanders had played behing a decent offensive line the sky would have been the limt.
What do you think made him so good.  He was all that big or fast compared to some others.
That's true but he had the ability to avoid tackles, which is why he never got seriously hurt.
I know what you mean.  I can recall Sanders making some moves that made very good linebackers look silly as they tried to tackle him.
Plus he had a low center of gravity with enormous thighs that made him hard to bring down if you could catch him.
It's such a shame that he left the Lions the way that he did.  Really left a bad taste with the fans.
Well I could kind of see his point.  He looked around and saw the Lions going noplace and still was healthy so figured he'd get out on top.
But he could have broken more records had he stayed just another year or two like Emmett Smith's record.
That was another thing about Barry that I admired.  He did not have a big ego and personal records didn't matter to him.
That's true.  I remember whenever he scored a touchdown - and he scored plenty - he would just casually flip the ball to the ref.
Yeah - no dancing or showing off from him at all.
He figured when he scored a touchdown he was just doing his job, which is refreshing compared to some of the show-offs today.
He was widely respected by the defensive players in the league who went up against him.
That's for sure.  Trying to tackle him was like trying to catch lightning in a bottle.
I remember during his first season during an exhibition game against the New York Giants, their great linebacker Harry Carson predicted that "No. 20 is going to be a great back."
And Carson was a veteran and all-star linebacker who knew what he was talking about when it came to running backs.
That's right. He knew a lot more than any sportswriter or coach or fan because he was out there on the field making the tackles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the Steelers this year?
Oh you know it.  Every year we are contenders for the Super Bowl.
I think the head office had a really strong draft this year.
We got some very good prospects.
What do you think about T.J. Watt as our first round pick?
Well he's J.J. Watts brother so that's not a bad thing.
I couldn't agree more.
He had a really good combine so I think he is a really solid pick.
I can't wait to see the Steelers beat the Ravens this year.
It is a wonderful sight every season when that happens.
I think the Bengals will give a little trouble this year compared to many in the past.
Why do you think that? We have always had there number.
I think they are getting desperate and need to show something or a lot of them are going to be gone.
I still don't think that is going to make them much of contenders this year.
I don't know it could cause some close games.
We had a strong draft and we have mvp caliber players all over the field for us.
So you aren't worried at all?
Not in the least, ever year we are in the hunt.
In Pittsburgh we expect the win the Super Bowl every year.
If you aren't first, your last.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Panthers might pull through again like they did in 2015?
I hope so, but they remind me of when I lived in Michigan. The U of M made it to the Rose Bowl numerous times, but lost.
I sure do like Cam Newton.
So do I it's nice seeing a tall quarterback and he's pretty quick on his feet.
I know this I hope the NE Patriots don't get in the play offs.
Why's that?
Remember how it got boring in basketball for a few years because it was either the Bulls or L.A. that went to the playoffs.
True.
What team would be your 2nd choice?
The Lions of course, but that's just a pipe dream.....
They were in the black & blue division back in the 60's right?
Yeah, now it's the Pink? NO, gray.....LOL
Ouch..........
Actually since I lived in Colorado many years I like the broncos.
I remember when the L.A. Raiders were feared or was that the Oakland Raiders?
I don't think they've moved recently
When's the last time you went to a game?
I haven't, baseball yes but I don't like the cold.
Those Green Bay fans are die-hards.
I think we all are in a way.....GO PANTHERS!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So it is almost football season.
I know cant wait til i have a game every Sunday to watch.
Still hoping the Steelers will go all the way to the Super Bowl.
Definatly theres no better team.
Really what about the New York Giants.
Nothing compared to the Steelers.
Seriously Eli Manning is their secret weapon
Eli Manning has nothing on the Steelers Ben Roethlisenberger
Eli is faster and has a better arm.
No way Ben might be a big guy but he has a cannon and he quick on his feet for such a big guy. Plus he can take a hit
Take a hit thats all he ever does since the Steelers offense is so sad.
New York is supposed to have a good offense They cant catch or protect their quarter back
You just wish the Steelers could be like they were in the 70s and 80s
Still my Steelers have won 6 super bowls compared to New Yorks 4 Super bowls Numbers speak for themselves
Sure 4 were won in the 70s and 80s when the good players and coach were in,  they arent any good now.
Almost all the NFL teams are better then New York maybe they can actually defeat Cleveland.
Oh Man that was mean the Steelers can even defeat the Cleveland Browns.
I think every team can defeat Cleveland.
We need to get together for a few of the games.
Sounds great we can argue the whole time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it football season yet?
Not quite, but I am ready.
Think Dallas will win the division again this year?
No actually, I'm picking another team.
You going with the Giants?
Actually no, I'm betting on the Eagles.
That's a surprise.
I like their chances.
I dunno, it's been a while since they were competitive.
Randall Cunningham days i assume.
Yes, I miss the old Eagles with Jaworski.
He was a gritty quarterback.
Dick Vermeil was a great coach.
He took the Rams all the way.
Wish he had done that here.
He did get the Eagles to the Superbowl.
There were some great player on that team.
I loved Wilbert Montgomery.
I was a big fan of Harold Carmichael.
That was a great receiver.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Arrrgh, I need a metric for predicting these games!!!
There is none. We go back to the human events and its randomness. if it's played by the computers using bad random number generators, then it can be predicted
How is that?
Marsaglia published a paper saying the random numbers fall mainly in the planes in the 60s.
Oh, so if we ARE to uise a poor random number to play football, then you can.. Ok I see it.
Yep. Besides, we don't want to be able to predict football. It's a game. We need that element of surprise, the human victory over the expectation.
Ah the drama of football
Indeed.Without that, there is no rooting for the underdog, and football without the underdog's triumph is just not the same
Unless, we can predict the underdog's triumph.
No.
Yes.
I wonder if Minnesota got any new running backs.
Why? Do they need an RB?
They're the dead last in terms of rushing yards. They averaged 75 yards/game rushing.
That's like half of Cowboys which is 149
Yep. Oh. They picked up Dalvin Cook.
Cook is a beast!
He had over 1700 rushing yards as a senior
Vikings made a good choice.
Yep, maybe they'll get more rushing yards now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think a 2000 yard season from a wide receiver is possible?
No I think thats way too lofty.
Its a passing league now.
But who could get that many receptions?
Odell Beckham could.
Yeah but you would have to average almost 130 yards a game.
You dont think thats hard?
I mean when you break it down like that no its not hard.
So why dont you think more guys do that
Cause getting to 130 is hard enough.
Guys produce like that all the time
Yeah but then they disappear like that
You dont think in todays game Jerry Rice could do that?
He may be able to
So the QB targets him more, it opens up other guys
Yeah but then you have backs tearing it up for 200 yards rushing
Then when they single cover the receiver he gets his
I wish it worked like that
May be we do see it before long
If they extend the season, yeah
XXXXXXXXXXX
Another day passes. Another day less until we finally see some football.
I'm so excited to see what all of the teams will do this season.
I really want to see what these rookie and second year quarterbacks can do this season.
Yeah. Guys like Wentz are definitely going to be an interesting watch.
The eagles look like they may have some pretty good weapons this time around so Wentz should flourish.
Anything is better than Agholor.
Wasn't he a top pick and he has absolutely done nothing for them?
If you look him up on YouTube all you find are lowlights. No highlights whatsoever.
I wonder if it's a mental thing or he just doesn't care to better himself.
Those terrible drops hint at it being mental honestly.
What other quarterbacks are you looking into?
I am intrigued by Goff from the Rams.
I know it has only been a year, but he has me worried.
He definitely didn't show very much last season, although his team wasn't top notch.
Gurley was completely ineffective the entire season.
Yeah a rookie quarterback with no running game is almost a guarantee to set them up for failure.
The old saying always goes a quarterback's best friend is a running game.
Definitely. They don't really have top receivers either.
I know they have Tavon Austin, but that's about it.
He could be great with any other team, but he's not really worthy of that contract with a low offensive talented team like the Rams.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is youtr favorite team?
I am a Cowbiys fan, but I worry they might have a down year.
Why do you believe that?
Their schedue is tougher, and I think other teams will be more fo them.
I wouldn't worry too much. They still have the same personnel.
What's your favorite team.
I have lways been a Saints fan.
They certainly have a soild offense.
Yes, but their defense is equally bad.
How you think they will do this year?
It is hard to say. They have had a lot of personnel changes.
Will their defense better?
It is really a matter of just wait and see.
Well I wish you the best of luck with them. Whao you think will win the Super Bowl.
I honrstly don't think the Patriots will win again, although they will be good. I think it may be some long shot.
For mysel, I think the Panthers will rebound and take it all.
I hope not. Given they are an archrival of the Saints, I can't stand them.
I can understand that.
I am going to need to go. Good luck with the Cowboys.
Thanks. Good luck with the Saints, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Chargers move to Los Angeles?
I hated that decision. The Chargers should be San Diego's football team.
I know it's sad that San Diego doesn't have an NFL team now.
It's just a really bad move. Los Angeles already has the Rams.
I didn't understand the move either. I mean win games, and the seats will get filled.
I know, it's not like the Chargers are like the Cleveland Browns.
Philip Rivers is a future Hall of Fame quarterback he just always comes up short because of the team.
I don't know how they'll be received in LA but I think Philip Rivers will have another good season for the Chargers.
I hope they made some good signings in the offseason.
They made a few but I don't think it'll be enough to contend or compete with the Raiders or the Chiefs.
That AFC West division is looking like a two team race at the moment.
Don't discount the Broncos. They still have a solid defense if not one of the best in the NFL.
I'm not forgetting the Bronco's defense but I just think they're offense is going to look terrible this year.
Yeah there isn't anyway the Denver Broncos can take the AFC West.
They might be able to sneak into a Wild Card spot though don't you think?
I'm not sure, because the Baltimore Ravens, the Cincinnati Bengals, and Pittsburgh Steelers always battle it out for the last Wild Card spots, whoever doesn't win the division.
It'll be tough for sure but I think defense goes a long way and the Broncos at the least have that.
I think that's why the Texans are going to be battling hard for that spot too.
JJ Watts is back so Houston should be a real threat in the AFC.
It'll be interesting to see if the Patriots can keep it going with all the competition this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you want to talk about?
How about football?
That sounds great
Awesome
It was a great season
Last year
It definitely was
Really exciting
Exactly
I cant wait til next year
Me either
Who do you like?
The panthers
They are pretty good
What about you?
Seahawks
Oh thats a good team
I love them
Have you always?
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the greatest Super Bowl of all time?
Easy, Super Bowl XX
Who played in that one?
Oh come on, Da Bears and the Pats!
Oh that's right. That was quite the Bears team.
One of the greatest teams of all time.
I wouldn't go that far.
Oh really, why not?
How many Super Bowls did they win?
Well, just that one, but they still had some characters.
Yeah, Jim McMahon was the biggest character of them all.
Man, that guy was crazy. Played like he didn't care about his body.
Yeah, the also had Sweetness.
Oh yeah, Walter Payton.
I think he was the greatest running back of all time.
Yes, many would agree.
Remember their coach at the time?
Of course, Mike Ditka.
Yeah, he was pure Chicago.
Actually he's from PA.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am so excited about the upcoming NFL season.
Are you rooting for the Patriots?
Yes I am.  I am a loyal fan.
I know you are.  You have been a fan for many many years.
It started when I moved to New England when I was 12.
Didn't you say that your dad is a fan too?
Yes he is.  Whenever possible, we attend the team's home games at Gillette Stadium every year.
Are you a season-ticket holder?
Yes I am.  My father is too.  He is 80 years old now.
I cannot afford to buy season tickets.
Well, the majority of my entertainment budget goes to the Patriots.
I can see that.  You always have their newest T-shirt and cap.
And much more...you should come to my house.
I will bet you have all kinds of souvenirs related to the Patriots.
Yes I do. I am inviting you to come over on September 7.  We can watch the game together on TV.
It is the Patriots against the Chiefs, right?
Yes it is.  I am so excited.
I'll bet.  You seem to look forward to the football season every year.
Yes. Superbowl  is a big holiday for our family.
You are so funny.  Yes, I would love to come to your house on September 7.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Cowboys are going to kill it this year.
Aren't you worried about the Seahawks, the Packers, even the Vikings.
There are some good teams out the in the NFC.
It surely will be exciting to see how the senior league shakes out this year. Dis you know that there used to be a separate league, the AFL.
I do. The Broncos, Patriots, Bills, Chiefs... There are a bunch, they had their own league until 1970.Before that, they were totally separate.
That is why Joe Namath is in the Hall of Fame. He brought respectability to the league. He beat the NFL Colts with his AFL Jets. He even guaranteed the outcome beforehand.
That was ballsy. The Jets were the upstarts, but they kick Baltimore's butts.
It really changed the adversarial dynamics of the league. The AFL gained respectability. They wont Super Bowl IV too.The chiefs Walloped the Vikings!
Then it was time to break bread.They new league would be much more powerful. A new level!
That is obviously how it turned out.Even greater than the league could have hoped.
Football is now king! It hasn't even been close for the last 20 years. Baseball is a distant number 2.
Hey, remember! We are only supposed to talk about pro football. What do you think of the Giants chances in the NFC East?
It all depends if the receivers can play like they did last year....without all the drama!
That stupid cruise down Miami during the playoff layoff was foolish!
Odell Beckham has to grow up and think! He is such an enormous talent.But, he has to grow up.
Would you take him over the Cowboys Dez Bryant?
No.Dez seems to have settled down. There age difference is small.As much as I like Odell's talent, I would keep Dez.
I like that the Cowboys drafted Ryan Switzer. Do you think he will replace Beasley?
I think they should keep both.I thought Cole had his best season last year. Why jettison him?
Well, that is just the scuttlebutt. I heard it through the grapevine!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Peyton Manning the greatest QB ever?
No I think he cant win that one now
Why not?
Not enough Super Bowl wins
So theres a set amount?
To be the greatest ever, yes.
So Brady eclipsed him by 2004?
It looks like that now.
But what about all the yards he racked up?
Just numbers at this point and not enough to grant him the best ever.
He still is a surefire Hall of Famer!
Yeah thats true.
I think his Denver years were alright though
That last year wasnt all that good.
Brady has been doing it consistently.
Right and both lost a year to an injury.
OK So we have to say Brady is the best, right?
Yeah, if you want a QB for one game you want Brady
Strange because Manning could dice you apart.
He could unless it was in a playoff game
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow the NFL coaching staff at all?
I'm really interested in stuff like that. I love the NFL as a whole.
Who do you think are the best coaches right now?
I think it goes without saying that Bill Bellichick holds the number one spot.
Yeah, you can't deny his ability as a head coach.
I don't think people realize the greatness that we're witnessing in his coaching abilities.
For sure. He'll be talked about for years to come.
Did you know he has as many championships as all the currently active coaches combined?
I didn't know that but I can believe it. That's crazy.
He also got hit with the biggest fine in NFL history.
Really? For what?
One of his employees got caught videotaping defensive hand signals from the Jets.
Wow. When did that happen?
It was back in 2007. Some people think they cheat because of that.
Well, I could see why.
A 500,000 dollar fine might make you stop cheating though.
That's true. I still think he's a great coach, though.
True. No one can deny there's talent there.
Do you think they'll go for championship number six this year?
I think it's highly possible. The Patriots are still a very strong team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
What's good
Nothing much
Same same
Bah
Wut man
I wanna go to a game
What game
A football game
Well
Well what
Why don't you go
Because reasons
What reasons
I'm to poor
Your not poor
How so
Seats outside of bleeders are expensive
True they are
Most definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like about the NFL?
The athletisism of course.
Yea same here. I went to a broncos game last year, center line.
Did you get close enough to smell the turf?
I was close enough to smell the players.
Are you going to any games this year?
No, not enough money.
I heard tyrod taylor might be the starting quarterback for the jets in 2018.
He's better then most of them.
I think there first game is against the bills.
That should be interesting.
Why is that?
Watkins, thats why.
No one can catch him.
You have to be able to get it to him first.
Its got to be weird for taylor to play against his last team.
No, players trade teams all the time.
I guess you are right.
Any time a new quarterback joins the team its always a rough start.
Depends on the quarterback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow! Those runners, though!
Yeah, look at that pacing!
Hey look, it's Aaron Rodgers!
Gasps! It really is!
Wave to him!
Hey, Rodgers? What's good?
(Rogers waves back) Wow, he said hi to me!
Nice job!
Thanks, appreciate it!
Now what?
We should probably get some food!
Yes, I'm starving!
What do you wanna get?
Maybe a cheeseburger, a hot dog, some fries and a soda! All sound good?
Yeah, I'll get some nachos, a soda, and corn dogs!
Yeah, that sounds good, too!
Alright, let's chow down!
Hmmm, that's good!
Yup, it is!
Wish we can do things like this all the time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Raiders this year?
I really like their team, they're young and hungry.
I love David Carr, he's a great leader.
I agree with you on Carr, he's got a bright future.
I also love their offensive line.
It's probably the best line in football.
I'm not totally sold on Lynch coming back though. It's tough for a guy to sit out a year and come back.
In his prime he was a fun running back to watch.
I agree, don't you think he's over the hill?
He might be older; however, he's running behind the best line in the league.  He'll have a good year.
What is your prediction for stats for Lynch?
I would say 1,000 yards rushing and 15 touchdowns.
15 touchdowns? I think you're way over - I'm thinking 8 max.
He'll get at least 15, David Carr even said if they're on the 1 yard line he's giving it to Lynch.
It's too bad they are moving to Vegas.  Oakland is one of the toughest places to play.
Yeah, I don't like the move at all.
I bet in 5-years the NFL looks at expansion and Oakland will be on the list.
Yeah, and they'll build a new stadium for them.
Too bad, they won't be called the Raiders though.
Yeah, surprised Oakland didn't fight to keep the Raider name like Cleveland did when the Browns moved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey NFL training camps begin at the end of this month are you excited
Absolutely I can't wait who do you think is going to win it all this year?
I know everyone hates them but I really think the Pats can do it again.
The Pats? No way cheating only gets you so far I like the Cowboys.
Really? What makes you think it's their year?
Their conference record was 13-3 last year they can only get better.
I guess Prescott is kind of like a young Brady or Romo.
Yes that's why I think they'll do it, he's young and strong.
What do you think about the Steelers? My cousin from Pittsburgh has been going off all summer about how they're going to dominate.
Roetglisberger doesn't seem too confident Dobbs might have to fill in.
Oh yeah Dobbs isn't very consistent might not be a great year after all.
You thinking about Super Bowl tickets? Vance has an awesome time there two years ago.
It might be cool to check out the new stadium in Minneapolis but it's going to be freezing.
I know might be worth it though.
Maybe I should plan on it might be worth it if Brady goes again, I'll keep an eye on it.
Really? He'll get hurt or caught doing something illegal again.
Aw come on a lot of players have been accused of much worse and got a slap on the wrist.
Yeah Roger Goodell isn't that consistent with his punishments.
Let's plan on an opening day party.
Definitely let's do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My boy Zeke is going to tear it up this year.
Who's Zeke?
Ezekiel Elliott.
Ah, that Zeke.  Yeah, hard to see him not doing good.
He was a rookie last year and led the league in rushing.
Well, he did play behind a good line.
Yeah, his line is good, but he made tons of plays after contact.
I still think on another team, he maybe breaks 1,000 yards if he's lucky.
You're just a hater.
Not hating, just stating a fact.
That's funny that you think it's a fact when it's unproven.
Just saying, probably a bit overrated.
Okay, so what RB would you take over him?
Le'Veon Bell for one.
Not saying he's not a good player, but he's no Zeke.
Yeah, for one, he's a more patient runner.
Okay, but why else?
He's also a better pass catcher.
But Zeke is younger and more durable.
All it takes is one hit and he's riding pine this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Bart! Are you ready for some football?
Definitely!
Will this be the year that Buffalo finally goes all the way?
The Bills? No, they had their shot...
This is a whole new team compared tot he glory days.  Anything is possible!
Glory days?  Are you still talking about the Jim Kelly era?
Of course! Man, they were so close, so many times!
You mean they choked so many times!
That's not fair! If it weren't for one bad field goal attempt, the Bills would be known as an awesomely dominant, Superbowl champion franchise!
Instead of a perrenial choke artist?
Like you have any right to bad mouth my team!  If memory is correct, I don't think your Philadelphia Eagles are wearing any Superbowl rings!
Thst's the diference between Bills fans and Eagles fans...
How many times we've choked?
No. You Bills fans optimistically rally behind your team and hope for another dream season ending in victory...
Of course! That's what it means to be a fan!
Not an Eagles fans!
What's the diffference between an Eagles fan and a Bills fans?
Bills fans hope for the best, and then are let down at the end of the season.
Fair enough. And Eagles fans?
We expect the Eagles to choke in the end. When it happens, we all say, "I told you so" and get back to the party without skipping a beat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team do you think is going to be the surprise team this year?
There are a lot to choose from but I would have to say Tampa Bay.
They do have a lot of good young players.
Yeah I think Winston is going to be hitting his prime this year.
He has Evans to throw to as well, plus didn't they add a new receiver?
Yeah they got DeSean Jackson this offseason.
That should help Evens get open more for sure.
Plus they drafted OJ Howard, he should be a big target.
They need to find a better running back though.
They still have Doug Martin.
He's suspended for the first four games though.
Yeah but maybe he'll come back rested and ready to go.
Think Houston is going to be a lot better?
If they get good play out of Savage maybe.
They have that great defense and a few big pieces on offense as well.
JJ Watt being back should make that defense even more scary.
Yeah if they can score 20 or more points a game they should be ok.
They are probably going to give the Colts a run for their money.
Don't count out Andrew Luck though, he's been pretty good ever since he got into the league.
He's good for sure but it might not matter if he's being sacked four times a game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about those Jets this year?
Ugh, don't remind me! They look bad!
They ever get their quarterback situation squared away?
Heck no! That offense is going to be putrid!
What a shame, they have a really good defense.
Yeah, they definitely know how to build a defense.
If they even have a mediocre offense, that team's a contender.
Gotta get that Patriots monkey off their back, though.
I think you're gonna have to wait until Brady retires.
Brady's going to die before he retires at this rate.
Ha ha, that may be true.
Plus I think whoever may take over for Brady may be effective in Belichick's scheme.
That's what makes him a great coach, he knows how to play to players strengths.
They get a lot of these guys, and they always seem to work, no matter who they are.
It's really amazing, the guy's a Hall of Fame coach
First ballot, for sure.
At least Buffalo and Miami aren't serious contenders right now.
You might be right about Buffalo, but I dunno about Miami, they just need to get over the hump themselves.
They have a lot of talent!
Yeah, if it wasn't for New England and Brady and Belichick I think the Dolphins are the best team in the AFC East,
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is an inspiring NFL player?
Larry Fitzgerald.
Is he their receiver?
Yes, and one of the best ever
I loved his play against the Packers in the playoffs.
He was really good
He is very hard to tackle
Yes, he has size
I like that he is an all around good player and person
He does have a great attitude.
He is very active in the community
He plays with a lot of heart too
Do you think he should go to the hall of fame?
Yes
I was rooting for him when the Cardinals were in the Super Bowl?
Me too. That was a great game
I am disappointed he could not hold the trophy.
He will one day
Do you think he will be traded?
No chance
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this game is a blowout
Is it?
Yeah Seattle is getting destroyed
Oh no
Huh
I said oh no
But why you say that
Because I like Seattle
Why bro
They are my home team
Ah
Yeah I grew up with them
Sorry to be a fan then
Where you watching the game at
I am in first row at the game
Man you are lucky
I know just saw three touchdowns up close
Living the dream
I sure am
Jealous
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about the Chiefs?
They're okay with the QBs.
What about the WRs?
Victor Cruz is always an option!
Yeah, he is!
Then there's Damarias Thomas!
What about Tight-Ends?
Groncowski?
Not sure what his name is, actually?
Same.
I think it's Gronkowski
Same.
Okay, who else?
A lot of people
Like who?
I wouldn't know!
Any good asians out here in football?
Not really.
What about basketball?
The only asian people I've seen in basketball are Jeremy Lin and Yao Ming
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear How Tom Brady upset the Pittsburgh Penguin fans?
No what did the Patriots quarterback do now.
He posted a picture of himself touching the Stanley cup.
So i assume Steelers fans are thinking he ruined it some how
Yes it was funny reading all the tweets of fans telling him to get his hand off the Pens Stanley Cup.
Well maybe he jinxed himself and the Steelers will defeat the Patriots.
I hope the Steelers make it to the playoff i would love for them to win another ring.
They already have 6 how many more do you want.
As many as we can get. I just dont want the Patriots to tie with use or get more superbowl wins then us.
I dont think anyone wants the Patriots to win much of anything.
I would like to go to the Steelers first home game against the Cleveland browns.
When is that
I am pretty sure it is September 10
Do you know what time it is
It is a noon game against the Browns.
I wouldnt mind seeing it.
I think it is cheaper then normal since it is a preseason game,
We should go see the game together
Ok i would like that lets make plans for it
Ok that sounds like fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite professional sport?
I'd have to say basketball.
Oh, of course, you're a Bay Area guy and the Warriors are doing so great.  What about the 49ers?
Well, yeah I've followed them for years and I do like the NFL.  What about you--what's your favorite?
Football definitely.
You and a lot of people, but what makes it so popular?
Tailgating, ha, ha.
I know you're just kidding, but, even so, most fans don't attend the game.
Well, they're probably tailgating at home.
The 49ers are driving me to drink, but really, what makes the game so popular?
I don't know--I suppose the physicality has something to do with it.
Physicality? Are you trying to get around saying "violence".
O.K. you got me.
But, I'm not that crazy about the violence and I enjoy the game.
Well, I think it's partly the suspense and the excitement that any moment there can be a spectacular play.
I get that--a 50 yard run by a running back breaking multiple tackles, probably outdoes a driving layup.
And the 40 yard bomb and diving catch is more exciting than a three point shot.
And there is a lot of pageantry and tradition in the NFL.
Well, we've made a couple points, but I'm not sure we've explained the popularity.  Maybe we need to be psychologists.
No, we need to be psychologists to explain the popularity of soccer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the Cowboys 2016 draft pick Jaylon Smith before?
The name sounds familiar but I can remember.
He was a stand out linebacker for Notre Dame.
Yeah I know who you are talking about. Didn't something happen to him?
Yes it did. He suffered what many people thought was a career ending injury in his last game as a college player.
Oh yeah. What type of injury was it?
A knee injury. I am not completely sure but I know he had nerve damage so there was a lot of concern about his future.
That sounds bad. Why would the Cowboys draft him?
Well without the injury Jaylon would have probably been drafted in the top five but when the Cowboys second pick came up he was still available and they took a chance.
Yeah! A big chance. That seems like a huge gamble.
The Cowboys had their personal team doctor look at his knee and he was confident it could be repaired.
That sounds promising. So that was two years ago, how is he doing now?
His surgery and rehab went great and he is now practicing with the team!
Sounds good but what is he saying about his knee?
He is saying it feels great. One-hundred percent and he expects to be out on the field this season.
Have you seen him practice? Does he look sluggish?
Not at all. There have been several videos posted online of him working out and practicing and he looks quick.
So it sounds like he will be able to come in and make an impact immediately.
The Cowboys need a pass rusher badly and Jaylon look like he might fit the bill perfectly.
I hope so. If this gamble pays off and the Cowboys end up with a top ten pass rusher it would be one of the biggest draft steals ever.

Hello Broseph

What are the chances the Cowboys make the super bowl?
I think if their offensive line is as good as last year they have a very good chance.
Will the Falcons be as good as last year?
Personally I thought last year was their best chance, I dont think Matt Ryan will have the same numbers as last year.
Will the Vikings make it to the super bowl and win it in their own city?
They have a good enough defense.  Unfortunately their offensive line hasnt improved much from last year it seems like.
Will Kirk Cousins have a good year?
No I think he is quite overrated and wont earn a large contract.
What do you think of LA having 2 teams?
LA couldnt support one team that long ago.  Not sure why they would have 2 all of a sudden.
Can the Jaguars finally put together a good season?
I think they have some good pieces but not sure they are ready to take the next step.
Who is your favorite player in the NFL?
My favorite player is Duke Johnson for the browns.  Hes a very electric player out of the backfield.
Will Teddy Bridgewater play this year?
I hope so.  Hes really fun to watch but I think theyll keep him out just to be safe so he doesnt get injured.
Are you excited for the season to begin?
Yes! I miss watching football on Sundays.
Will the Ravens make the playoffs this year?
I doubt it.  Not sure Joe Flaco can carry them that far without a solid defense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to be watching the big game between the Vikings and Packers?
Of course, I never miss it
Who are you rooting for?
The Packers
Do you wear one of those foam cheese hats?
Yes, my kids got it for me for my birthday. Who are you rooting for?
The Vikings
Have you always been for them?
Yes, I grew up in Minnesota and as a kid I would go to some of their initial practices in my hometown of Mankato
That would've been really neat to see them practice
It was a lot of fun, those practices were pretty informal being so early in the season
Did you get many autographs?
Yeah, a couple years I got a number of pages full of autographs of some of the great Vikings like Alan page and Carl Eller
Those were the great times, back when the Met Stadium was still open, nothing like them playing football in the open in the middle of winter
Yeah, totally agree. It really lost something when they built the dome, it just wasn't the same
The new Vikings stadium seems to be pretty popular
That's what I hear, but my friends are I haven't been to it yet, so I can only go by what I see on TV
They're playing in Green Bay this week, so it will definitely be in an open stadium, have you heard what the weather is going to be like?
It's supposed to be -10° and snowing, chances for a heavy snowstorm
Great! It will be just like the old days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm looking forward to Sunday. It's time to renew the rivalry with Tom Brady.
It sure is time. It's good to have tom Brady back!
That's very true now that the NFL's two best quarterbacks get to go head to head.
They are not the two best quaterbacks this year. Maybe in 2006 they were hot.
That's funny being that your team couldn't even beat Seattle.
No, says the guy who's team got screwed by replacement referees.
That's classic coming from a guy who's team is twelth in the league with quarterback ratings.
My guy at least won a Super Bowl in the past five years.
They had to do something to make up for getting discount double slammed.
Your jealousy and your teams inadequacy is so obvoius.
Who's jealousy? You can't keep up with a conversation about elite quarterbacks.
You can't honestly consider Flacco elite.
How on earth is he not an eilte quarterback?
Manning, Brady, and Rodgers, those are the elite three.
Maybe if your head they are the top three. Regardless, Joe Flacco is still top tier.
Okay, believe what you want.
Well, why don't you think Joe Flacco's top tier?
Joe Flacco sucks. There's no way he has earned a place in quarterback history.
The same can be said about Rodgers.
Now there is a biasis opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can recall seeing the December 1967 NFL Championship game on tv when I was 4 years old.
Oh my gosh! That was the "Ice Bowl", the Cowboys against the Packers.
Yes, in Green Bay. Minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit! Then it dropped to minus 20...
That's considered to be one of the greatest games in football history. Lucky seeing that!
I remember wondering why people were sitting there on stone benches in Lambeau Field, trying to stay warm.
Right. Fifty-one thousand people! They could have been home in Milwaukee or where ever watching on tv.
Vince Lombardi was the coach, Bart Starr the Quarterback...
A lot of the Green Bay Packers had a hard time getting to the game. Their cars wouldn't start!
Oh, that's right. I think it was the a Linebacker who had to hitch a ride to get to the game on time.
And the Referees wore ear muffs! The opening whistle actually stuck to the Ref's lips!
Right. They had to use voice commands for the rest of the game.
Shame no regular person had a video recorder back then. No full copy of the tv broadcast is known to exist.
What? You're kidding me! How stupid.
Only the Cowboy's radio broadcast, and the Green Bay radio recording.
I remember Don Meredith, the Cowboy's Quarterback, handing off the ball in the fourth quarter, and the RUNNING BACK making the pass!
Yes, a 50-yard pass to make the score 17-14 for the Cowboys.
I remember Packers slipping on the ice near the 1-yard line! They said one player actually scored, but the Ref didn't see it.
Some players on the COWBOYS years later said they thought that Anderson scored a touchdown.
And Bart Starr ran the ball in himself, making the score 20-17 for the Packers, 13 seconds left.
Game ended 21-17. Bart Starr didn't even tell his own players that he was going to try running it in. Only Lombardi knew!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Minnesota Vikings?
I think they are a decent team. Not great but decent.
What makes you think that?
They lost Teddy Bridgewater to that nasty injury. No one knows if he will play again.
Yeah that was a bad situation, they do have Sam Bradford.
Bradford didn't do too bad last year given he didn't have an offseason to prepare.
Adrian Peterson is also gone, which is a bummer.
They did get Latavius Murray in Free Agency so they should be fine. AP was old.
They also drafted Dalvin Cook, so I agree their RB's will be just fine.
They do have a great defense, that secondary has become very solid.
Harrison Smith may be the best safety in the game
True, and Xavier Rhodes is becoming a shut down corner.
What you think their record will be this season?
I am thinking 9-7
Playoffs or no playoffs?
Wildcard playoff spot by the tip of their tongue. First round elimination
Who you think will win that divison?
Packers are still the team to beat while Aaron Rodgers is the QB.
I think that also, Bears, and Lions are still rebuilding.
The Lions yes, I have no idea what the Bears are doing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you ever heard of the superbowl curse?
no, but i doubt it's real.
listen, it's definetely real, or else it wouldn't be a curse.
so what does it entail?
well, there's several parts to the curse.
the first i'm guessing is people who have ever won?
yep, teams that continously get to the superbowl but always lose.
well, i know the vikings have never won.
yep, and neither have tons of others.
well, they should try harder.
ha ha, well the other part of the curse is that people usually lose on their home field.
what do you mean?
basically, if a team plays the superbowl in their home area they are garunteed to lose.
interesting, like what teams?
okay, i remember the falcons definetely being one.
okay, so one team out of 32.
and the 49's! you dont remember when they lost?
i do, but they lost in their state?
yes, i'm telling you!
i don't know how much i believe this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the NFL in the offseason?
A little. Mainly just until the draft.
The draft had a few surprises.
Some, but I'd say the biggest surprise was Mitchell Trubisky going so high!
I know. I would've thought Deshaun Watson would've been ahead of him for sure.
I know. Watson was the third quarterback chosen.
I didn't expect that at all. I was also a little surprised by Reuben Foster.
Why is that?
Well, he's a great talent obviously, but he left the combine because he got into a fight!
That's right. I forgot about that. Well, sometimes teams are willing to take a chance to get a great player.
That's part of the reason we get such bad role models in sports.
Unfortunately it's about the money usually.
I know, but it seems like if a guy can't even handle a combine he's just going to be a problem.
Well, I think we kind of saw that with Colin Kapernick. He wasn't doing anything bad per se, but he didn't make life easier for his team.
I know. And now he isn't being picked up because of it.
I don't know if that's the whole reason. He really hasn't been that impressive as a quarterback.
True, but combine that with the fact that any team that takes him is going to have to deal with political issues and it doesn't bode well for him.
You are right. At least it hasn't so far.
It'll be interesting to see if he gets back in if someone gets hurt.
I'm not sure which team would be willing to give him a try.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
What do you think of something?
Think of what?
Their new player
What team
The raiders
Oh their lineup is whack
You think it's bad
Yeah it's awful
How so
Their defense is pathetic
Well that I true
It's just sad
True to much power
Exactly
And not enough cover
Pretty much
Their reasons for loss
Precisely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which team in the NFC East do you think will be the most improved?
The Eagles with their 2nd year QB and offseason additions.
Which team in the East you think will be worse than last year?
The Cowboys, I dont see them winning 13 games again.
You think Carson Wentz is going to help the eagles make the playoffs this year?
Yeah as long as he can stay healthy and the weapons around him are decent.
What about Dak Prescott? You think he will be as efficient as last season?
I think so, they wont be as good because people will have scouted for him but he should be good.
I think Elliott is going to dominate again, that offensive line is great.
I agree, that OLine is nasty and will continue to pave the way for Zeke.
Who is going to be better, Wentz or Prescott?
Wentz easily. He has more athleticism.
But what about last season? Wentz had more interceptions than touchdowns
When you have a makeshift OLine for most of the season and Dak has the best, you cant compare them just yet.
I can see where you coming from, the numbers are hard to miss though. Dak was better.
Yeah he was better but he also had better talent around him.
Dez and Zeke were really good so I guess what your saying makes some sense.
It will change this year, the eagles went out and got some weapons.
Maybe we will see some more identical stats this year based on that.
I sure hope so. Eagles fans sure are hoping that as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how many eagles games are you going to this season?
what?
i thought you were an eagles fan?
i am. i don't be going to no games though.
how you a fan and don't go to the games?
man, i be watching on my seventy-two inch television.
i know that's right.
and i'm gone be right in front of my tube when they beat the crap out of washington week one.
wow. y'all got a division game right out the gate?
yeah. that ain't about nothing.
didn't washington beat ya'll twice last season?
yep. that means we owe them a double ass-kicking.
i know that's right.
who you like this season?
i'm riding with tampa bay. i think they win their division.
the saints and falcons might have something to say about that.
man, the falcons gone be garbage this year.
what about cam newton and them?
last year showed their true colors...PINK.
soft as cotton candy huh?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many teams are there in the NFL?
I think there's 32.
Wow, so many!
Not really, I would think there would be more.
Right, cause there's so many people in the United States.
Yep, like 318 million or so.
How many people are on each team?
I have no idea, maybe like 30?
Yeah, and then gotta add assistants and water boys and such.
Sure, so more like 50.
Still, that's a lot of people.
Yeah, I think most of the teams are pretty spread out in the U.S.
Probably, there's probably a lot in the north though.
Specifically north east, I would assume.
Yeah, I wonder where the NFL was formed?
I believe Ohio, if I'm not mistaken.
So yeah, northern teams would be popular.
Mhm, I think southern teams are popular too.
Some states don't even have a football team!
I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw highlights from Superbowl XVI.
Who played in that one?
San Francisco 49ers and the Cincinnati Bengals.
Where was it played?
The Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.
Who were the quarterbacks?
Joe Montana for the 49ers and Ken Anderson for the Bengals.
Who were the broadcasters?
Pat Summerall and John Madden.
Who scored first?
49ers, 7-0 after one.
What was the score at the half?
20-0, 49ers.
Who did the halftime show?
Up with People, Motown tribute.
How did the third quarter go?
Cincinnati scored a touchdown, making it 20-7.
What happened in the rest of the game?
Cincinnati scored two touchdowns but the 49ers scored two field goals, making it 26-21.
Too bad.  I liked the Bengals' uniforms.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
Fun stuff!
Yea I love watching it
Me too!
Do you go to many games?
Nah, not really
Why not?
I just can't get tickets
Too expensive?
Nah, I work during a lot of the games
Oh, that sucks!
Yea I really want to go
You should take a day off soemtime
I'd like to but I just keep asking but no luck!
Aw man, your boss seems terrible!
Nah, it's just the business I'm in
Some day hopefully
Let me know if you get one off!
I will man
Good plan!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the NFC this year?
I'm thinking it's going to be the  Cowboys.
Why the Cowboys?
They have a great offensive line, Elliot is a beast and Dak will mature another year.
You forgot to mention their defense, they've made some improvements on that side too.
Yeah, Cowboys all the way in my opinion.
I happen to think the Falcons are going to win the NFC.
How come?
Even though they lost the Super Bowl last year, they will be hungry to get back.
I disagree with you, they lost Kyle Shanahan. It's going to hurt their offense more than you think.
Yeah, but they didn't lose any other players and they still have Matt Ryan.
I agree Matty Ice is a great quarterback.
Ryan is the best quarterback in the NFC behind Brees and Rodgers.
As long as Ryan doesn't get hurt, the Falcons will win at least 10 games.
You also forgot that they have Julio Jones!
Julio is the best receiver in the league.
In addition, they have the best 1-2 combo at running back with Freeman and Coleman.
Yeah, I overlooked them.  If you can run the ball it opens up everything on offense.
I'm thinking Falcons and Cowboys in the NFC title game this year.
Wait, what about Green Bay!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot wait to see how the Cowboys do next year.
Yes that was amazing last year.
Yes they played one of their rivals, Green Bay.
Yes that was a close one.
It was so close, those losses hurt the most.
Are the Cowboys your favorite team.
Yes they still are.
Wow you should be happy they made the playoffs, that is an accomplishment.
Yes that is something positive.
They fought hard.
It was a devastating loss.
It always is.
I think they will make the necessary adjustments and come back stronger next year.
Yes I agree.
Their offensive line is amazing.
Yes they are super solid.
They can build a team around their O-Line.
Yes I agree.
It will be exciting to see what the skill positions can do with the increased time the O-Line gives them to make plays next year.
Yes it will be exciting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is an interesting fact about your team that most people don't know?
Buffalo changed to their iconic red helmets not only because they were badass, but because quarterback Joe Ferguson was color blind. So with four teams in the AFC East having white helmets at the time (Pats, Dolphins, Bills, Colts), Ferguson was struggling to separate receivers from defenders.
Which player do you believe was the biggest playoffs underperformer?
Marvin Harrison was a complete ghost in the Playoffs. He'd be my pick for biggest Playoff underperformer.
When Will Samaje Perine Take Over As The Lead RB For The Redskins?
I really hope he wins out. No disrespect for Fat Rob, i like him too and believe he has starter ability; but Perine was my favourite back going into this past draft so i really want him to succeed.
Who was your favorite team to watch of all time?
The Tim Tebow phenomenon was a wild ride!
Who were the biggest preseason underdogs to win the super bowl?
1999 Rams were 300/1 underdogs.
Adam Vinatieri ages like a fine wine
He's one of the very rare HoF kickers.
Your favorite team relocates with a division rival. Are you still a fan?
Las Vegas Chargers has a nice ring to it.
What do you think are the biggest rivalries outside of their division but within their same conference?
Packers and Seahawks, easily
How many gadget/trick plays had your teams offense run in 2016-17?
uhhh, does an interception off a foot count as a gadget play?
Which great teams are forgotten because they were overshadowed by really epic teams?
1999 Jaguars - went 14-2 with both losses coming against the titans. blew out dan marino's dolphins 62-7 in the first round of the playoffs only to lose to the titans for a third time
XXXXXXXXXXX
So then the wonderlic test is kinda useless
Uh... why?
Because people who score very high like Fitzpartick isn't all that good. And Gore who scored the second lowest is very good
Or, you're not using the test results correctly.
How so?
Well, the NFl separates the positions and averages the scores out by the positions
Oh. Then what happens?
Well you get an average score for the each positions.
Are the QBs highest?
Well, Offensive tackles score the highest.
That's so weird.
How so?
Tackles don't really need high IQs
Oh contraire.They DO need more intelligence than other positions. They have to make tackle, blocking decision.
There you go again with decision.
Well, the decisions are pretty difficult to make under stress and ina blink of a second, if you miss the block, the ball carrier goes down
And the play is over...
Exactly. What's really surprising is that running backs have the lowest scores.
Haha, well That DOES NOT suprise me.
How so?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to Romo anyway?
He retired
He has the 4th highest passer ratings. It's kinda sad that he didn't have any superbowl wins
Like we talked about, winning the Superbowl isn't all skills, but also depend a lot on luck.
Even going to the Superbowl depends on luck. Who's healthy, playing well, etc
And each game depends on the play calls too.
Yep.
Romo's going to be a color analysts for the CBS anyway. He's getting 1.5 mill talking about the sports he loves
That's a great job.
How do they calculate that paser rating anyway?
Huh. No idea. I reckon there's division involved
Ya think? Let me see here. Oh it's a weighted average
What does that mean?
That means a certain nunmbers are averaged andthen weighted by multiplying a factor.
But there are 4 categories, completion/attepmts, yards/attempts, TDs/attepmts, and interceptions/attempts
yeas, and each categoriy is mutiplied by a factor, albeit each by different factors.
Where did they get the factors?
You know, I have no idea on that one. But the goal is to get each number to be, at maximum, 2.375 and then those categories are then added and weighted again
This is too confusing. I think QBR from ESPN is much better
But you don't even know how they calculate it. You just like it because it's from ESPN. They've never made the details public, until they do, i trust the passer rating from NFL
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the NFC East this year?
The Eagles are being favored but I think it is wide open
Why do you think that the Eagles are so highly favored?
They done real good in free agency in the offseason
Who were some of the free agents that they signed?
LaGarrette Blount, Alshon Jeffrey, Torrey Smith, Chris Long, and they got Nick Foles back
Nick Foles! Their old quarterback
Yes. He went to Kansas City for a year. He was a casualty of the old Chip Kelly system
Still. The NFC East is packed across the board. It should be a wide open race.
The Redskins done good this offseason. The Cowboys offense is going to be good and Eli and Giants are always around.
Who were some of the free agents the Redskins accquired?
They got Terrelle Pryor and DJ Swearinger
Terrelle Pryor is going to be an elite WR in this league
He had a breakout year last year for sure
He should even do better in Washington with Kirk Cousins at quarterback
I could easily see him getting 1,200 to 1,300 yards receiving and 10 plus TD receptions
DJ Swearinger is a good player as well
He will certainly solidify the Redskins defensive backfield
The 2017 season in the NFC East should certainly be another tight one
It certainly looks like it could be
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you hoping to see some quality football this year?
I most certainly am.  Football season is about the only time I watch television anymore.
Are you rooting for any specific teams?
Of course, but mostly I just want to enjoy some great competition.
Don't leave me hanging, which team?
I like the Seahawks, but I won't be disappointed if a number of teams are successful this year.
So you're more of a fan of the sport than a specific team?
Sure.  I really like physical competition and the nature of football creates a lot of physical engagement, suspense, drama, and glory.
So what do you like about the Seahawks then?
I like their style of play.
You mean running the football?
Yes, I think running the football is one of the most effective strategies when combined with a strong defense.
And having that amazing stadium certainly helps that defense.
It does and it's also an amazing experience to be in that stadium when it's loud.
I know.  I've been to one of their games and even though it was preseason I was thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere.
Seattle really is a football city.
That's probably why their attempts to bring back a basketball team have failed.
It doesn't help when those teams have historically under performed.
Hopefully Seattle will have a good, injury free season.
And some better offensive linemen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite NFL player of all time?
I have to say its Brett Favre.
Why is that?
Because he didnt quit until he was old, the dude is an inspiration.
My favorite player of all time is Peyton Manning.
He's a solid choice.
It was so awesome to see him win a Super Bowl on the way out.
Yeah that was a fairytale ending for him, I have to admit.
I'm also glad he retired when he did though, I dont think he would have survived another season.
I think that is how Tom Brady will go out.
Winning a Super Bowl?
No, playing one season too many and getting some horrific injury.
Oh yeah I can see that, him at age 45 getting flattened by some linebacker and breaking everything.
Well, that would be fine, I really dislike Tom Brady.
I think nearly everyone does, except for people in Boston.
Who do you think will be the best quarterback this year?
I dont know, there are a lot of great quarterbacks in the league, I think Marcus Mariota could have a great year if he says healthy.
What about Dak Prescott?
That guy is a flash in the pan, he's going to end up like Colin Kapernick who was worthless once defenses figured him out.
Yeah good point, he's had some good games but I think you might be right about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the Cowboys this offseason?
I have been a little whats going on?
Man, they  have lost 4 due to being arrested or suspended!
THe most recent is Wilson!  He was at a 4th tailgate party and tried to run over a lady.
Yea I heard about that!  And he pulled his shotgun on some guy?
Thats what I heard too!  That could lead to some serious issues.
I also heard that Dak was using a machine to sign all his memorbilia.
Really? So, what, he is not signing himself or what?
Yea so they are saying it is an autopen and maybe he didn't know it was going on? So I guess representatives were doing it and he didn't know it was going on.
That is crazy!  I am sure he pays someone to watch out for stuff like that!
I can not wait to see him and Zeke at camp this year!
I think this is gonna be our year!
I think if we can get through all these troubles we stand a good chance.
I think if we can get thru the Eagles and the entire East we will kill those North guys.
The Patriots still showing to be on top.
Nah, they have an older team at this point.  Past their prime.
Its gonna be a fun season thats for sure.
We got alot of new blood in the draft that is for sure.
I hope we can have a smoother summer and get these Cowboys on the right track.
Jones will get them in shape quickly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the NFL season starts on September 7th this year?
That is coming up quick. Who is your favorite team?
I'm a big Tennessee Titans fan since I live in Nashville.
Are you going to any of the games?
I am going to try to get tickets to the first home game.
When is the first home game?
It is Sunday, September 10th at Noon.
Who are they playing?
The Titans are playing the Oakland Raiders.
That should be a good game. What's the name of your stadium?
It is Nissan Stadium.
I think I passed by there once.
You probably did because it's in downtown Nashville.
Oh, right. When's the second home game?
It is on September 24 against the Seahawks.
I'd rather see the Titans play the Colts. When is that game?
They play the Colts on October 16th.
That would be a nice time for me to visit Nashville.
Yes, I'll try to get us some tickets to the Titans/Colts game.
That would be great. I would love to go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, I cannot wait until the start of the NFL season.
Tell me about it.
Yup, our Packers are going to dominate, I can feel it.
Right on, we're going for it all.
Aaron Rodgers MVP, he is going to come in with a vengeance.
Yes, all that criticism last year, he has something to prove and it will be great for our team.
Yes, we will at least win 14 games, maybe even undefeated this season.
Well I do not know about undefeated, but I can see 14 wins happening.
Come on man 16-0 and undefeated postseason.
Well I am worried about the Patriots, Seahawks and Raiders this season.
Yes, they will be good, but we will be better.
That optimism, I hope you are right.
I am, Brady is older, Wilson isn't near the passer Rodgers is and Carr was lucky less season.
Maybe, all I know is in Rodgers we trust.
Yes, but now we have a team that is ready to compete.
How do you think the offensive line will do this season?
I think they are going to get Rodgers time, he's going to get good looks.
I hope so, Rodgers with time is unstoppable.
Exactly, I think he will have a career year.
Well let's go out an win it all then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well, it's getting close to pro football season.
Yeah, it's almost time for training camps.
Do your 49ers still have theirs at Sierra College?
No, they have it in Santa Clara.
That must be better for the players--Sacramento area is so hot this time of year.
Yes, I imagine.
It used to be thought that hot weather was good for you to get in shape.
Yeah, I think they've gotten over that theory.
The players are more valued than they used to be in the good old days.
Not a good idea to dehydrate your multi-millionaires ha, ha.
Have you been to the new 49er stadium?
Levi's Stadium, no they made it too expensive.
You could go to an exhibition game--a lot of season ticketholders will give those games away.
Yeah, but those games aren't much fun, and the crowd is unruly.
Yeah, a stadium full of people who don't usually go to the games.
It's a burn that season ticketholders have to pay full price for those games.
For sure; oh I must correct myself--ownership calls those games preseason games, not exhibitions.
Well, pretty boring whatever you call them.
Have you ever been a season ticketholder?
Shared tickets with a group back in the glory days.  As I remember, we'd each get two tickets to two games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think will be the biggest Cinderella team this year in the NFL?
I'm gonna go with the Rams winning the NFC North division!
Wow, that is a very bold prediction.
Here is my other prediction. Brock Osweiler will start at quarterback for the Browns.
You must be a comedian. Brock is the absolute worst quarterback I have ever seen.
He at least has some experience, so there's some hope. Maybe a new team will suit him better.
But the Browns man. They are not a great team.
I know, but they are a young team and hungry. You never know.
Alright. My prediction is that Brady retires this season after winning the Superbowl
No way, The man says he wants to play until he is mid-40s.
Well, when you have six rings, that might be untouchable. Plus his wife is worried about him.
I don't think so. He's still playing at a high level. And if they win, he has to try for the three-peat.
Maybe you're right. That would be a crazy goal that he would like to achieve.
Him and Bill Belichick you know! No one has done that before.
How crazy would it be if they went 19-0 this year to win the superbowl and then next year, get the threepeat.
No one, and I mean no one can ever touch their legacies ever!
I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. Imagine watching that play out.
It would be historic. Any NFL fan would have to appreciate it.
I can't wait for the season to start already!
I know, I got a new big screen TV just to watch the games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the new jerseys that Nike makes?
I think I preferred the old ones.
I don't know, there isn't much of a difference.
The Nike ones have those awful gloss stripes around the collar.
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.
I prefer the old jerseys because they looked cleaner.
Personally, I wish there was just more differences when it came to jerseys when it switches brands.
I thought the old ones were fine. I don't know why they changed them
I think it's because Nike offered more money to sponsor the NFL.
Oh, that's right.
It makes sense, considering that Nike is the biggest sports company in the world.
That kind of makes it even worse. Shouldn't they then know how to make a good jersey.
I think the quality of the jerseys are top quality.
I mean, in terms of how the jerseys look.
Some people do like them. Some don't.
I'm one of those that don't.
Personally, I was never going to buy one anyway, so it doesn't matter.
I did buy one, and I can tell you that they aren't designed that great.
If they perform well on the field, that's the only design players care about.
Well, that's something I'll never find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who do you think will make the NFL Superbowl 2018?
I actually believe it will be the Seahawks and Panthers.
So, you think the Patriots won by chance last year?
No.The Patriots did not play a great team in the Superbowl.
You don't believe The Falcons was a great team?
The Falcons was a good team but not great, they always die in the second half of a game.
Are you a Seahawks fan?
Not really, I like there Quarter back Russell Wilson.
Do you think Russell Wilson is a better quarterback than Cam Newton?
They are both great players but Russell Wilson has a slight edge over Cam.
Speaking of quarterbacks what is your opinion of Matt Ryan?
Matt Ryan is improving his game every year, if he stays on that track he will be the next great quarterback of all time.
Okay. How would you rate The Redskins quarterback Cousins?
Cousins is good but he needs more help from his teammates.
Now that the the Redskins just added Doug Williams as Vice President of personnel do you believe he can acquire better players to help Cousins?
Actually we will have to wait and see if he does.
Do you agree with the new contract amount for Kirk Cousins?
It is a large amount he needs to totally improve his game.
Should the Redskins change their team name?
I am just curious as to way it has taken this long for people to acknowledge it's an offence word for many.
XXXXXXXXXXX
No, I mean if Cook was in a different team he wouldn;t have ranked that high.
Well, I don't know about that. Cooks has a pretty good YAC at 15
YAC is yards after catch?
Yes. 15 yards after catch is right up there with the top receivers
His target/reception is pretty low though. 78 out of 117 targets. That's like 66%
yeah, but that's not really all on him. it also depends on the defense covering the receiver.
TY Hilton's is even worse, at 58%. Yet he's the no 1 receiver in the league
Well, again the target/reception doesn't really tell you much about the receiver.
Jordy Nelson's is about 63% yet he has the most TDs last year at 14
That's because how the Packers likes to score. And Nelson is Rodgers' favorite target for the end zone.
You know what's funny?
What?
The Patriots's no 1 receiver isn't even in the top 10.
Oh, yeah. And they still won the superbowl. Hahaha.
And their RBs aren't that great.
LeGarrette Blount is a 8th ranked RB. pat's running game is on point
The Pats use him to punch in for the TD.
He does have 18 TDs, more than any other RBs.
Does he have really that many?
Yep, the second is David Johnson at 16 TDs. and Then Zeke Elliot at 15
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how do you feel about the world of sports these days?
I mainly just watch the NFL for the most part.
Do you have a particular team that you cheer for?
Yes, I am a huge Tampa Bay Buccaneers fan.
I thought you were! How have they been doing?
They had a pretty good year last year, finishing second in the NFC South.
Was that good enough to earn them a playoff birth?
No, but it was pretty good when you consider those nine wins were more than they had in the previous two seasons combined.
That is true. It is all a matter of perspective I guess.
My hope is that they can take it a step further this upcoming year and get in the playoffs.
They sure did not seem to give Lovie Smith much of a chance to be successful there.
Yea, he was fired rather quickly I thought. Although Dirk Koetter seems to have been a great replacement.
How do you feel about the quarterback position?
I think Jameis Winston is going to be a huge star!
You really think that he has what it takes?
Absolutely! I wanted him ever since the first time I watched him play at Florida State.
I saw him play against Auburn and win a national championship; he seemed to have star potential.
I think in a few years he will be considered among the best quarterbacks in the entire league.
Does he have any play makers around him?
Mike Evans is really good, and this year they signed DeSean Jackson as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey football season is coming up, are you excited?
Yes I love the NFL
Who is your favorite team?
I like the Chiefs but thats only because I grew up in Kansas City.
Yeah im that way with the patriots since i grew up in Boston.  Id rather they win but im not super upset if they lose.
You have Tom Brady though, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time so that has to feel good!
Yeah, its nice but hes not everything.  Its the rest of the team that help make them good.
I think its interesting how the NFL is so focused on quarterback play and passing now.
Yeah i agree, back in the 80s and 90s it was good to have a strong running game, but now theres something like 13 quarterbacks who threw for over 4000 yards last season.
Yeah, look at Eli Manning, hes thrown for over 4k for the last 4 years and has two MVPs and two rings and people still disregard him..
Yeah theres just so much quality in the new guys like dak prescott.
I agree, dallas is going to be set if Dak can keep up with his current play.
Id rather have a good quarter back like rogers or stafford than none at all i suppose.
Thats for sure.  I feel bad for the teams like the browns who always are trying to find a new player.
Speaking of the browns, how do you think that RGIII will do with them.
I think he will fail just like he has in the past, hes just too frail to play in the NFL.
I think you might be right.  Kind of like Tony Romo, so much talent but just incident prone.
Yeah then theres guys like peyton manning who has his neck bones fused back together and somehow can come back to win a superbowl
Yeah, peyton is certainly an inspirational story.
Im glad he was able to get another ring.   I loved him with the colts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think the Patriots can repeat this year?
No way! Tom Brady is getting too old, he's going to break down eventually.
They say that every year and it never happens, now he's got more weapons
But what Aaron Rodgers and the Packers? Talk about weapons
Brady now has Brandin Cooks, that's going to a really hard combo to stop.
Fine, my dark horse though are the Ravens
Really?? Joe Flacco? No way
They've got Jeremy Maclin now, finally a good reciever for him to throw to, plus a bunch of other targets
Nah, bet the Ravens go 8-8, miss the playoffs
But that Baltimore defense is intense. Although they have to get by the Steelers twice
Yeah Antonio Brown is dangerous. Who do you have for the worst team?
Cleveland Browns, like every year
I was thinking the same thing. Whose the team that comes out of nowhere to almost win it all?
The Oakland Raiders
Yeah! Derek Carr and that huge contract? Why not
Yeah finally a good team from California
I mean Los Angeles now has the Rams and Chargers
Yeah but neither of them will do anything, plus the 49ers are terrible
Yes San Francisco is the second worst team in the NFL
They should resign Colin Kapernick
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best quarterback in the league today?
Tom Brady is the best.
Overall as far as historical accomplishment I agree.  But I mean who will be this year.
Brady is older now his performance might go down now.
So who do you think will be tops this year?
Maybe Aaron Rogers?
I think he will have a good year again as usual.
Matt Ryan is a good quarterback.
Yes, I don't know who will be in the top three now that some of the better ones are getting older are retiring.
Russel Wilson from Seattle.
Russel is good but he doesn't have a very top tier quarterback feel to me.
He is a smart runner.
What about Drew Brees from New Orleans?
I always liked Drew's game quick release and accurate passer.
Like some of the better ones he is also getting older.
What about Big Ben in Pittsburgh?
He's good but maybe in the top ten not top five.
Andrew Luck from Indianapolis is good and what about Cam Newon?
Cam is too much of a show off to me.
I tend to dislike these kind of players too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, where are you going to see the game?
I am going to the game.
Really, where did are your seats?
20 yard line, not bad.
Why do you like the dolphins so much?
Its my home town team, and because of ace venture.
You know they haven't been good since the 70's, right.
It doesn't matter, team spirit.
Do you like any other teams?
I like the lions.
Is that an NFL team?
I really don't like you right now.
Falcons, Broncos?
I like them, I like everyone in the AFC East.
Did you get me a ticket?
Of course I got you a ticket.
When do we leave?
We are in the car already.
You told me we were going to the doctors.
Yup, I am a liar. Told you, I am a dolphins fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate this down time we are in for sports right now!
I know what you mean,unless you are a baseball fan it really stinks at the moment.
At least we don't have to wait to much longer and the NFL will be here.
That is what I keep telling myself!
Who do you think we will be the best teams this year?
I feel that the Patriots and Cowboys will be the teams to beat this year.
The Cowboys? They have not sniffed the Superbowl in years.
That does not mean they can't get to it this year!
So is that your Superbowl prediction then?
Yes, It will be the Dallas Cowboys vs the New England Patriots.
I am going to record you saying that so you can not deny it later on in the season.
I am pretty confident in that pick actually.
The patriots I can understand; but not the Cowboys!
I do not see why, they are actually a very talented team.
Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith are not walking through that door!
Who do you think will be in the Superbowl this season?
I think it will be the Pitsburgh Steelers taking on the Green Bay Packers.
I like that prediction; although I do not think the Steelers will be all that great this year.
They are a consistent franchise and I respect that.
I guess we will see which one of us has the better predictions when the season rolls around!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, what happened between the Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee Titans last night?
The Vikings were able to pull out the win.
Oh really. What was the final score?
The vikings won the game 25 to 16.
Who was Minnesota led by in passing yards?
The quarterback, Shaun Hill threw for 236 yards.
How many did Mariota pass for on the Titans?
Mariota threw for 271 yards.
Also, did Mariota have any interceptions?
Yes, he had 1 interception.
I figured that. How many rushing yards did Adrian Peterson get?
He only had 31 rushing yards.
So, the Titans shut out Peterson but still lost the game.
Yea, I was shocked that happened.
Who was Minnesota's top receiver for the game?
The top receiver was Stefon Diggs with 103 receiving yards.
Who was Tennessee's top receiver?
Tajae Sharpe led the Titans, but he only had 76 receiving yards.
Okay, I think I have a better understanding of why Tennessee lost the game.
Yes, it was interesting. I'm waiting to see what they do next week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't believe the pAnthers picked up McCaffrey.
How so? Panthers is a running team.
That's why. They have already pretty good running game, what they shoould've done is a picked up a good WR.
Well Panther's running game is largely driven by Jonathan Stewart and Cam Newton
Yeah, Cam's the second in their team in terms of running yards
And that's not really a good thing, because the QB can get hurt running. They need another RB
They have other RBs,. Whitaker, Artis-Payne, etc. Don't need another RB
Yeah, but they're not as good as McCaffrey. He's a beast
He is good. i wished they picked up another WR or a TE
Another TE on top of Olsen? Olsen is already no 3 TE in the league
Who's no 1? Gronk?
No, Surprisingly, Travis Kelce
Oh yeah, Alex Smith does love his TEs.
And to think the beginning of the season last year, we were all like "OMG, KC Chiefs running game is stacked!"
Haha, Charcandrick West was such a disappointment.
Anyway, another WR for Panthers is kinda redundant at this time. Between Olsen, Benjamin and Ginn Jr, they have over 2700 yards
How does that comp[are to other teams?
Like in terms of passing yards? The team that passes the most is New Orleans Saints. Brees loves to throw. They had over 5000 yards passing last year
That's close to double that of panthers
Well passing between the top 3 of Pather's receiving core. Pathers had over 3600 yards passing last year
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the last NFL season?
In general I think it was pretty disappointing, especially the playoffs
I agree; there should be more variation in the teams making the playoffs
The regular season wasn't all that great, either, for just about any team
Yeah, unless you're a Patriots fan, and even then you get four games without Brady
Not that that made much of a difference for their win percentage
And you really can't argue with the end result, even if you're a fan
Patriots fans will always find something to complain about, even after a historic win that shatters about ten different streaks
I guess there's no satisfying some NFL fans
I really enjoy the sport in general, but seeing the same teams win and same teams lose every year is tiring
It was strange seeing the Bengals miss the playoffs for the first time in several years
I would have been more surprised to see them win a playoff game, to be honest
The AFC North ended in bitter disappointment, with the Ravens outshined by the Steelers, and then the Steelers getting crushed by the Pats
You really can't depend on the Steelers when it really matters
I think if the Steelers are going to knock the Ravens out of the playoffs, the least they can do is put up a fight against the Patriots
The Patriots rivals seem to be just about everyone else at this point
I think the rest of the league will loosen up once Brady and Belichick are gone
Which, with any luck, will be very soon
And with Ben Roethlisberger nearing retirement, it will be harder for the Steelers to make repeat appearances
It's about time for some parity in the AFC already!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the Cowboys win their second Super Bowl?
Back in 1978...for the 1977 season
Oh wow, that was a while back.
Yeah it was a number of years ago.
Who was the coach back then?
Tom Landry
Oh yeah, he was with them for awhile.
Sure was.
And the QB was Roger Staubach?
Sure was. Great QB.
Who did they play back then?
The Denver Broncos
Oh, the Broncos first Super Bowl?
Yes, one of many.
Yeah, they lost a lot early on.
That they did.
Did they have any famous players on the team.
No hall of famers, but had their famous Orange Crush Defense.
I guess it didn't do too much crushing in the Super Bowl
No they did not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Derek Carr was worth all the money the Raiders gave him?
I think they overpaid.
Carr seems to be headed to be a top quarterback in the league.
He is okay.  I don't know if he is really elite yet.
The Raiders are clearly better with him running the show.
They have made lots of changes, but yes, he has been okay back there.
I just don't know if I am sold on him.
It just seems like more hype than proof at this point.
With the big deal, he is going to have high expectations.
If they don't advance deep into the playoffs, people will start turning on him.
Carr has lots of more options to help him out now.
It just adds more expectation.  If he doesn't deliver a superbowl win, the fans are going to turn on him.
Even if they don't win a superbowl, the level of play of the raiders is much better than the past.
Carr is getting the tools and now he is going to have to make something happen.
His stats should get better with all the new additions on offense.
The raiders look good on paper, but you never know when they get on the field.
Carr staying healthy is going to be in everybody's mind.
He is not going to have much room for let downs after getting the big contract.
Yeah, people are going to be looking at him as an elite qb now.
Even if he falls off, he will still have the fat paycheck.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like football?
Who me?
Yes you, who else?
Of course I like football.
Do you like the game, or the social aspect?
I think I use it as a crutch?
A crutch?
An emotional crutch. I might have a problem.
Oh my, I wasn't ready to get serious.
I drink too much.
Don't say that!
Its not even about the game anymore.
Don't be daft you love football, of course its about the game!
I don't think so, its just about sitting around and forgetting my problems these days.
I can't believe it, I'm so sorry.
Don't be, you helped me admit it.
I wasn't trying to turn this into an intervention.
Well, you succeeded.
I guess I'm happy to help.
This was a real emotional touchdown.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you hear about Monday Night Football?
No, what?
Hank Jr. is back!
Awesome, maybe the NFL will end the PC crap.
Madden and hank Jr., that's football to me.
I think we're getting old...lol.
Man, this time of the year I begin itching for some football.
I know what y ou mean,  that first pre-season game is almost as exciting as the superbowl to me.
How are your Bears going to do?
Honestly, I'll be surprised if we make the playoffs.
There's always some team that comes out of nowhere and surprised.
Maybe Cleveland?
The Browns?  Ha! not a chance.
I heard that Johnny Football was looking for another chance.
I'd sign Tebow before giving Johnny another chance.
Tebow is playing baseball these days.
Who do you think improves the most this year?
Maybe Washington?  They're due. So much wasted talent.
I think it will be a breakthrough year for the Titans.
Maybe, but they need better blocking. No run game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How will the Raiders do this year?
They should win their division this year. Got better on defense and they got Lynch
You mean Gareon Conley? Is he out of trouble?
Don't haven't heard nothing about that yet.
Hope he is OK...
Yeah, but he needs to be in jail if that is true
I don't think he did that. Will give him the benefit of the doubt.
Yeah. He's pretty good though. At least he was at Ohio State
Messed up that they are moving to Vegas
It is what it is...business as usual
They would have to play at night, or in a dome
I personally think the town is not gonna support them
Why do you think that?
Too many distractions...know what I mean?
They have to offer more than casinos though
Don't know if that's enough though
We'll see. If the teams is any good, that will be a pretty hopping town.
Maybe...we'll see
So are they good enough to beat KC?
They'll catch them this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot wait for preseaon football to start!
It will be here in less than a month.
I know, who do you like this year?
You know me, I am a Patriot's fan all the way.
Ok besides them then.
I think the Titans have a lot of new talent, should be interesting to watch.
I think so too, I have been by some of the open practices, and it looks like they have a lot of great chemistery.
How important is that really to the game?
I think it is very important, as important as skills.
What part of the team intrigues you?
For the Titans, it would be their offense.
Why the offense?
Last season, their defense was virtually impregnatable, but the offense could never seem to connect.
That is true, their quarterback always seems to lose his arm mid third quarter.
I agree, and with the new running back, I think his energy is going to inspire the whole team to work harder.
Titans have not historically had a strong ground game.
Exactly, Fisher was all about the air game, like he had a few picks that were the entire show.
That is no way to run a team.
I think their chances are good this year of at least a playoff.
I do too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to football season?
Definitely!  I'm a huge fan
Me too.  Which team(s) do you root for?
I'm from Tampa so I like the Bucs. What about you?
Nice.  I like the Falcons, the Patriots, the Seahawks...
Wow, you follow a lot of teams.
Yeah, I'm really into it.
Do you do fantasy football as well?
Sometimes.
Yeah me too but I'm more into just watching games, following my team, etc.
So are you a fan of Jameis Winston?
Yeah, I went to Florida State so I followed him through his college career as well.
Cool.  He definitely went through some controversy during college but he's done well in Tampa.
Yeah, I agree. Who are some of your favorite players?
I'm a huge fan of Tom Brady, I know a lot of people are over him but I think he's great.
Yeah, I get that.  He is a great football player.
Definitely, there's something to be said about all those Superbowl wins!
Yeah.  I love Peyton Manning.  I know he's retired now but he was an awesome player.
Him and Eli both.  I was sad to see Peyton retire.
Yeah, but it's fun to see him in all those Nationwide commercials!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the San Francisco 49ers this season?
I think they are going to be bad.
And why do you think they will be bad?
Lots of reasons Most importantly Jed York the owner has no clue what he is doing?
Why do you think he has no clue?
Because he thinks he is Eddie DeBartolo is Uncle that led them to fame in the 1980's
Yeah, I agree. They are in a major rebuild.
What do you think is most important to do to rebuild the franchise?
Many things exclusive of him selling the team. That will not happen.
Please give me some examples.
Well first off, he should never have fired Jim Harbaugh.
Why is that?
Harbaugh is a proven winner. Sure some people are hard to get along with but that is true of any business.
So are you saying he should of sucked it up and kept Harbaugh?
Exactly. His ego got in the way of winning and screed the pooch.
What else contributed to their demise?
Well, trading Alex Smith and hanging their hat on Colin Kaepernick. Anybody with brains new Kap did not have the brains for the position.
What do you mean the brains?
I mean football I.Q. he had the arm and the speed but could not go through his progressions.
I agree. That was a poor decision not to mention York meddling when he had no experience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Less than one month from opening kick-off. You pumped?
Dude, I'm totally pumped. What do we have? Chiefs Patriots? That's going to be good.
Agreed. Sounds weird, but I feel like football season helps signal the arrival of fall. Changing seasons. All that.
True. True. Even though it can still be hot as all get out.
New England early September. That should be nice.
Easy living. Who do you think'll win?
Win? Man. Definitely the Patriots. I'm more interested in the spread and the over-under.
You wager?
Funny thing is, no, not really. But I do like to know the lines. Seems like the over-under regularly comes down to the final few plays of the game.
I know, right? Bookies are smart.
Very smart.
Speaking of gambling, you think Oakland will be okay in Vegas?
Raiders' move? Oh yeah. No problems. You can bet anywhere. Any time.
I'm with you on that. It'll be cool to see Mayweather's tickets, though. 500k here. Another 200 there.
Right? No. The Raiders will be good. What a great location to see a game. Afterwards, you hit the strip. Shows. Food. That is all good.
It'll definitely be the hot ticket in the NFL for a minute.
True. The England play seems pretty cool, too.
Yup. I just wish they didn't send scrubs most of the time. I almost feel guilty to the British people.
Hysterical. But yeah. There's that.
Still, pretty cool. Though the games start way too early.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite NFL player?
My favorite player? Hmm. I'm not sure I have a favorite player.
No one at all?
Well, I usually think in terms of teams.
So what teams do you like?
I like the Ravens a lot. They were very popular where I grew up.
Hmm. That makes sense.
What about you?
What about me?
What teams do you like?
I like the Steelers a lot.
Didn't you grow up in California?
Yeah, but my Grandpa was from Pittsburg, and we used to watch games together.
That sounds like a really nice memory.
It is! I really enjoyed those days.
What about players? Do you have a favorite?
I was actually asking because I'm not sure if I do!
No one at all?
If I had to pick, maybe Ben Roethlisberger.
That's a good choice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The first NFL preseason game is going to be in less than a month!
Wow, I can't believe it's that time of year again.
It seems just a few weeks ago that the Falcons lost to the Patriots in that epic comeback.
I think both teams will do well this season. Pretty much all of the players from last year are intact.
Matt Ryan will be a man on a mission this year...if he's healthy.
The Cowboys should get far too. Prescott will be more mature and just as athletic as last year.
Yeah, the Cowboys should win the NFC East without a doubt.
I think some other teams that were good the past few years will be going downhill though....The Packers and the Saints won't make the playoffs.
Yeah, both Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees are getting old.
I am looking forward to what Derek Carr is going to do in Oakland. If he didn't get injured late in the season, they could have gone deep into the playoffs last year.
Yeah, the AFC is going to be pretty competitve, with 5 mediocre teams battling it out.
Who do you think will make it to the SuperBowl this year?
I think both the Patriots and the Falcons can return to the Super Bowl again, although Patriots and Cowboys is also probable.
Patriots and Cowboys would be a really good game to watch.  All of the good teams are heavily dependent on their quarterbacks being healthy, though.
Tom Brady always has a great offensive line protecting him. That's why he's still able to play so well. He's going to be 40 this year!
Yikes. He's one sack and one bad injury away from retirement then.
A lot of teams have no hope from the beginning this season, because they don't have a quarterback!
Yeah, Cleveland again, and the Jets!  Both of these teams will be lucky if they win 5 games the entire season.
It's surprising no one signed Colin Kapernick.
Well, he has major image issues outside his playing ability. I don't think teams would want to deal with that when they are having a losing record.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the upcoming NFL season?
Like you wouldn't believe.
I know.  I really enjoy watching games.
It is nice they are on so many days now.
I know.
It seems not long ago it was just Sunday and Monday.
It was.
Now they have Thursday and sometimes even Saturday.
Not to mention the games overseas.
That is right.
Then you have Sunday morning football.
I think it is a good thing.
I do to.
Some people complain about the schedule.
I know.  I don't understand that.
I don't either.
I really enjoy watching Thursday football.
Why is that?
Because I work Monday through Thursday so it is my first night off.
That must be nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Derek Carr deserve his deal?
The Raiders will be loving that deal sooner than later.
How so?
Once Wentz and Prescott have to get paid itll look like a steal
That could be said for any quarterback though.
Like Brady?
Or even Brees and Roethlisberger.
Thats strange.
The market has set out a specific number for a franchise QB.
Yeah you dont see most of them hit free agency
Not at all, you see Mike Glennon and Josh McCown but thats because they are backups only.
I cant believe Chicago gave that money to Glennon.
Yeah its funny money you pay in free agency when you cant draft well.
They took Trubisky for some odd reason.
They throw a ton of QB slop against a wall to see what sticks
Is Cutler still with them
No they cut him obviously
Did he sign with anyone?
No his career is all but over
He made alot of money for doing very little
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the NFL expand ever again?
No I think they have a good thing going with the franchises they have.
I think they could go global.
I see London as a huge hurdle.
Whys that?
The currency exchange, the 6 hour time difference just to name a couple.
They play more games there this year than they ever have.
I know and I am sure theres a lot of grumblings from players about it.
You almost always do have to take a bye when you get back
Right and imagine having to take a bye on week 2
Or if you are a division opponent
Yeah so you are put at a disadvantage.
Exactly and players wont want to live that far overseas
How about in Mexico
I think the problem there is fans like soccer more than football
They always sell out the stadiums there
Yeah for one or two games a year
True but they have shown they have an appetite for it
That would be a better location than London
But Trump might put a hold on those plans
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who won the game?
The Sharks!
I knew they would.
Yes, by a landslide!
They've got strong players.
Absolutely.
John Forte is thier best lineman.
Oh ok. Peter Crunks is too.
Yeah, he's good but slow.
No! Not my Peter!
Yes, he can barely hit a good touchdown!
Well, his last season wasn't his best!
John Forte is like a tank.
He's alright.
Who would win in a race?
I'd say Crunks.
No way!
Way!
Forte would run him over.
In his dreams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your team for the upcoming football season?
You know I'm 49ers all day, man!
Well, that's a shame. Their offseason looked terrible!
Not as bad as the Jets, however.
That is true. Their offseason was probably the worst in history, and that's in a world where the 49ers still exist!
At least the 49ers have an established team, however. The Jets can't seem to ever get it together.
That is true. What do you think of the division this year?
Seahawks are our biggest threat, I think. Cardinals and Rams are worst than they were last year, I hope.
You don't think David Johnson is a threat!? You're crazy!
He is, but Palmer is so old.
But still great. He just needs some better offensive weapons to throw to.
And don't even get me started on the Rams.
Where are they now anyway? Los Angeles.
Yes, unfortunately. LA didn't even truly want a team!
I did hear that. But yeah, I think that the Seahawks are the biggest threat in that division.
I'm glad you agree. If we can get one up on them, we can make a move for the one-seed.
That's a lofty goal, however. They picked up Lacy.
You mean Feast Mode? He can't run anymore!
You won't be saying that when the 49ers play the 'Hawks!
We'll see soon enough. Preseason is very close!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for football season?
I have been ready a long time for football season actually!
I know what you mean, life is very bring without the NFL!
Have you had the chance to go to any Carolina Panthers games the last couple of seasons?
I have went to a couple, but not as many as I would like.
Me either! I am wanting to go a few times this upcoming season though.
That should be fun, what kind of team do you think we will have this year?
It is hard to tell judging on the past two seasons.
I know, the year before last was awesome. However, last year was a major let down.
It sure was!  I am still scratching me head about last season.
Me and you both. Hopefully Ron Rivera will figure things out though.
I am kind of concerned about Cam Newton myself.
Yea, he did not quite seem like himself last year for whatever reason.
Hopefully he will go back to playing like he was when he took us to the Superbowl!
I think he will, I am more concerned with how the defense performed last year.
The front office made some great moves in re-loading our front line this off season. So I am hoping that works.
Me to, I am glad we were able to resign Mario Addison as well.
Yea that was very big! He is a nice asset to our defense in my opinion.
Plus we still have Luke Kuechly, and that is the most important thing!
Yea, I think he is one of the best linebackers in the entire league.

I am getting excited about football season.
You're getting excited about football?  It is the beginning of July.
Rookie camp starts in two weeks.
Rookie camp?  Come on man, that's not that exciting.
It is to me. I can't help but think of all the effort that these guys put out to get to that spot and I get excited for them.
You're a good fan. Any predictions for this year?
I predict the Patriots do not win the Super Bowl.
Oh really, so who is going to win?
The Pittsburgh Steelers, that's who!
And why is that?
Because they have more talent on offense than anybody.  Roethlisberger, AB, LeVeon and now Martavis is back.
Yeah the offense is strong but I think defense wins football games.
The defense will be better too.
Why?
Because Cam Heyward and Bud Dupree are both injury free.
That's really the key isn't it.  I mean, staying healthy that is.
That is the most important thing of all.  I can't even begin to tell you how many games have turned on injuries.
Games have turned and unfortunately, so have careers.
Man, I know, it is the worst part of the game.
Always terrible to see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there, I'm pretty excited for the football season to start, are you?
Absolutely!  I'm getting ready to start draft for my fantasy football league.
Oh really?  You have a football league?
Absolutely!  You want to join?
Most definitely, last year in my other league I very mistakenly put my faith in some of the bears players like alshon jeffrey, I'd love a chance at redemption
Oh yeah, the bears have been absolutely terrible as of late.
Yeah I'm hoping with the dump of Jay Cutler that the bears can actually improve.  Who knows, maybe they'll have a shot of making a comeback like the Cubs.
I don't know, I think it's going to take a while for the bears to rebuild their dynasty.
You know who I miss?  Urlacher, that guy was the heart and soul of that team.
Yeah the defense and the o-line has been horrible.
It's not small wonder Cutler was perpetually sacked, man couldn't get rid of the ball.
So who are going to be your top picks this year for the draft?
Oh definitely members of the patriots if I can, like brady, gronkowski, edelman.
Yeah the patriots are killing it...but do you think that the broncos can come back without manning behind the helm?
They have a lot of talent in their wide receivers...but you have to have a high quality QB at the helm.
And decent running backs, last year I had todd gurley as one of my first picks, dude hardly got me ANYTHING!
I think Matt Ryan could be strong at the helm for the falcons.
It depends on if he can continue his hot streak of if he slowly peters out like Manning did.
Yeah...I'm still bitter about his abysmal performance.
Well here's to kicking off "any given Sunday"!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the 49ers this season?
That's a tough question.     Division-wise, not much.
What makes you say that?
Well, they came in last place in the NFC West last season.
I understand that, but didn't they improve?
Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch know what they are doing, yes.
So how will that knowledge show up?
Well, they will win more than two games!
What is your prediction on wins?
It is early, but 8 wins (a 0.500 season) would be a challenge.
Where would that leave them in the division.
Still last, probably.
Which team do you expect to win?
I think Seattle is a lock.
What about the rest.
The Cardinals and Rams may keep San Francisco in the picture.
That's difficult to hear.
Actually its a good thing, as the 49ers are improving quickly and may have a shot in a couple of years
I guess that is reason for optimism.
True, but there are always the Patriots as most likely AFC opponent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Are you ready for football to start up again?
I can't wait... espcially because I playing in a few fantasy football leauges this year!
I love fantasy football but I never seem to do very well in it.
It's part luck and part knowing who the elite players are.
It makes sense that the more knowledgable one is the better they will do
Yeah, if we're not in the same leauge I will help you make some choices as to what players to draft if you'd like?
That would probably be very helpful as I tend to always pick my favorite players but not necesarily the best players.
I follow a lot of teams pretty closely and always pick players based on their abilities... not whether I like them or not.
Speaking of players... who is your favorite player?
Mine is Drew Brees... what about yourself?
I am a big fan of Carson Wentz. I am excitied for what he can do for the Philadelphia Eagles this year.
I think he's an exciting player that could have a long career.
Yeah. I just don't think we will ever see someone as elite as Tom Brady has been ever again
I can't stand him because he is so skilled and I'm sick of him being so good!
Yeah, he's definitely overstayed his welcome. He should retire while he is a champion.
I agree, but I also wouldn't be surprised for them to have a chance at winning it all again this year.
I really just don't want the Patriots or the Cowboys to have any success this year.
I think it's going to be a bounce back year for a lot of teams that didn't fair to well last year.
I hope so. I'd like to see new teams emerge as contenders... that's always exciting to watch.
We'll wait and see... I just can't wait for football to be back!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the PITTSBURGH STEELERS.
They are one of the best.
They began in 1933.
They play at Hienz Field.
They train in the town of Latrobe.
They used to be an AFC Central team.
Now they are AFC north.
They have 3 uniform styles.
They are black, gold white combination.
The Rooney Family owns the team.
They are Irish.
They have owned the team since it started.
Art Rooney founded the team.
The team used to be called the Pirates.
They have the most SUPER BOWL wins.
I think they won six.
They have 30 playoff appearances.
That is like half of all the SUPER BOWLS.
They are the oldest franchise in the AFC.
They used to not win a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the Super Bowl this season?
I don't know. That's a good question. I can definitely say that it won't be the Patriots again!
Why not? They still have Tom Brady as quarterback.
I think there are a lot of other good up and coming teams this season.
I guess you are right. I think the Cowboys look promising.
I agree! I think Dak Prescott is going to have a great season this year.
I'm more excited about watching Ezekiel Elliot. I think he might break the all time rushing record one day.
I agree, he is a great player. But one thing about the Cowboys is that their defense isn't very good.
You're right about that too. What team do you think will have a good defense this season?
The Steelers, of course, but they always have a good defense.
They drafted TJ Watt. Do you think he will be anything like his brother?
I heard he was even better, but only time will tell I suppose. I'm not sure about the Steelers offense though.
Don't you think Roethlisberger can win again this season?
He has won some pretty impossible games, but overall he is inconsistent.
Do you think the Steelers can win their division again?
I think they can as long as they can beat the Ravens, and as long as they can still get two free wins with the Browns.
I think this is the year for the Browns. They made a great draft choice with Myles Garrett.
I'm actually surprised they went with a defensive end and not another quarterback.
Well, that's probably because they already have a locker room of quarterbacks.
That is really funny, but I think you're right. But I agree, I think they will definitely win more than one game this season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the game this Sunday?
Yeah, for sure. I'm a huge Broncos fan.
Oh haha. They're playing the Browns, so I'm going to be rooting for them.
Well, we can still be friends. The Browns will never win.
Yes, some say that the Browns will win the Superbowl when hell freezes over.
They keep firing all their coaches, that's why.
Yes, they do need to find a good coach and stick with him.
And they have some crazy players too. At least there is nothing as bad as Jim Tressel's scandal at the college level.
Right, just rivalries.
Other divisions have rivalries too, though.
I'll stick with the Browns, though.
Whatever floats your boat. When was the last time they even won the Superbowl?
Not even answering that. Maybe it's because they don't have any good players like the Mannings.
Peyton Manning's not so hot now..
He was good for the longest time.
Yes, Peyton Manning and Brett Farve are some of the best career players.
Brett Farve did NOT know when to retire.
Wonder how he could throw if he was still playing now.
Pretty badly. Still, the Vikings aren't doing well nowadays.
Perhaps they'll beat the Broncos today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
CB's in the league took a bit of a hit last year.
What do you mean exactly?
Just seems like some depth at the position is missing.
I think there's a lot of good CB's playing.
Not saying they're not good players, but not really a top ten player right now.
You mean like a Deion of old?
Well, there will never be another Deion.  I would take a Revis.
So any shutdown corner really.
Yeah.  Patrick Peterson was probably the best last year.
He's always been really good for the Cards.
Good, but not great.  You wouldn't vote him into the hall.
Didn't that one guy play well too?
One guy?  Wow, that's helpful.
The guy that plays for the Chiefs.
Oh, Marcus Peters.  Yeah, he's coming up quick.
He was a great draft pick by Andy Reid.
I should probably include Sherman too.
Overrated in my opinion.
Maybe, but he's a great player.
He
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there are any teams that were as good as the Patriots are nowadays?
There were quite a few great teams in the past, but none of them has lasted as long as the Patriots' dynasty.
Did any teams come close?
The Steelers and the Cowboys probably came the closest.
What did they do? Did they win a lot of Super Bowls?
Back then it was a little harder to win it every year or every other year. The schedules were a little tougher and medical technology wasn't as good.
Then why do you say they were so good if they didn't win it every year?
Because they could have won it all every year without injuries and such. The Steelers won the Super Bowl 4 times within a 6 year period.
That's pretty good. How about the Cowboys?
The Cowboys were one of those teams that was good every year, year in and year out, for decades. In fact, I think two of the Steelers' victories came against the Cowboys.
Were there any other teams like that?
The Vikings were great every year, but they always lost when they made it to the Super Bowl. They won it one year, but lost all the rest.
Anyone else?
Sure. Green Bay was a solid dynasty rivaling the Patriots, but they were on the decline by the time the Super Bowl became a 'thing.'
Then why do you say they were great?
Well, before the Super Bowl there was the league championships, and Green Bay was always winning their league championship. It culminated with Green Bay winning the first two Super Bowls and then they went into decline.
Is that it? Were there any other great teams besides the Steelers, Cowboys, Viking, and Packers?
There were the Rams.
What did they do?
They were one of those 'almost' teams that constantly dominated their division, had a great defense, terrorized everyone, but always managed to lose in the playoffs. In fact, they never made it to the Super Bowl until XIV, when they lost to that great Steelers team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
TIm!  Are you coming over to watch the game tonight?
I can't, I'm sorry Bob.  I've got the kids unexpectedly.  Homework and such.
Lets do it at your place then!
I could probably do that, they both love the Raiders too.
Ew more Raiders fans.
Broncos fans are any better?
We are!  Gonna take that division title tonight and kick the raiders to the curb.
We still have a chance at the wild card!
So you admit Broncos are superior?
Laughs.  No!
But you just admitted they were gonna lose.
We're down most our front line because of injury.  Yes I think the broncos will take this one.
They are on quite the winning streak.
Yup, reminds me of Elways days behind the reigns.
He was king.
that i'll agree with.
He just had this presence about him.
Yup, He knew he was the man.
So what time you want me there with wings?
WINGS?  About 6.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, Paulito, do you plan on going to any NFL games this year?
I'm not sure, but I sure hope to.
You travel a lot for work, have you been able to visit any stadiums when you travel?
Yes, I have been to games in Denver, Arizona, Dallas and Houston.
Wow, that's pretty good.  I have only been to a couple of games in Dallas.
Dallas has my favorite stadium, I love all of the technology that's there.
Yeah, I really enjoy it too, but I would like to visit an outdoor, cold weather stadium as well.
Wow, do you think it would be fun to watch the game in the cold?
Sure, it would be even better if it were snowing!
I don't know if I could handle it, I am to much of a Southerner.
Ha, I know what you mean, but I think the atmosphere would be amazing.
I can't argue with that.  Which stadium would you like to visit?
I think Chicago and Green Bay would be a lot of fun.
Those are two classic stadiums...Soldier Field and Lambeau Field.
Yeah.  I think a game in New York would be fun too, though I think I would enjoy Buffalo more than NYC.
I agree there, I'm not a fan of either NYC team, but I could handle watching the Bills play.
Same here.  I think it would be fun to tour all of the NFL stadiums.
Yeah, that sounds awesome.
There is so much history in those stadiums.
We should plan a five year expedition to visit them all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever go to an NFL gsme?
Yup.
Where?
Orchard Park.  Bills stadium.
What was that like?
Not as good as you might think.
Well, I was only about 12 yers old, and I was a Colts fan at the time.
Colts fan? So you went to Bills stadium as a Colts fan?
You got it!  My Dad took me to the game.
Why were you a Colts fan?  Didn't you live in Bills country?
I sure did, but I was just a child.  I picked the Colts as my team because I liked the horseshoe emblem.
That was it?
That was it.  I knew nothing about the Colts or the Bills.
What happened at the game?
Upstate New York in winter.  My Dad and I sat in freezing rain for three hours, watching two teams I knew nothing about, wearing a Colts poncho, while sitting in a sea of Bills ponchos.
Who won?
I don't remember. I just know who lost.
Who?
My father. You see, he endured the rain, and the sleet, and the jeering fans, and the nosebleed seats, and the high prices, and the frustrating parking, and the miserable game, only to hear his 12-year-old boy--15-minutes intot he game-- say, "Dad, when can we leave?"
Did your Dad ever speak to you again?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's see, remember when the Packers were in the last Super Bowl
Yes, it was Super Bowl XLV (or 45, I think). Played Feb 6 2011.
Yes, and the Packers won, correct?
Yes they did, score was 31 to 25, it was a close game
Yes and remember when Troy Palamalu did all those hair commercials. Women would kill for hair like that.
Oh yes, I do remember that. Wasn't it for head and shoulders.
yes I do remember it was. We were all comparing his hair to Clay Matthews, but I think Tory won hands down.
I agree. That was some year.
Yes, I remember all the parody songs they came up with. Some were pretty funny.
Yup, I remember the parody of Black and Yellow for the Steelers.
I remember that one also. You know, I can't remember who did the half time show
I believe it was the Black Eyed Peas
Oh yes, I love them, I'll have to you tube it to remember.
Speaking of super bowls, we went to Lambeau Field and bought a DVD of the Ice Bowl game between Packers and Cowboys.
Really, would love to borrow it some time
Sure, but we haven't even watched it yet.
Lombardi, the King of all coaches.
you got that right "Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing"
He was a hero.
Yes he was
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like there are so many people in the NFL who need to retire.
Really, what is the cutoff age again?
I don't think there's an official cut off age, but so many players are pushing 40.
40 year olds still got it, though.
Yeah, but you know that over time they just lose stamina and agility and such.
What is the youngest you can be in the NFL, again?
Probably 18, I really doubt 18 year olds get drafted though.
There's probably really young players on teams.
Yeah, but they don't play much I assume.
I wonder how the oldest player in the NFL is.
I don't know if he's officially retired yet, but Bret Farve was definetely the oldest for a while.
Yes, I remember him! A defense, right?
I thought he was a quaterback.
Either way, you are right in that he is older now.
Yeah, I know for a fact he is over 40.
He must have been in the NFL forever.
Yep, good player though.
Eventually your time is up though.
Yeah, like I said it's time for him to stop.
They all retire eventually.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi Jerome, who is your favorite NFL player of all time?
Of all time?  Well, I would have to say that my favorite is Bill Bates.
I have never heard of Bill Bates, tell me about him.
He was a player for the Dallas Cowboys.
Interesting.  What position did he play?
He played safety and played on special teams.
Was he a star?
I wouldn't say that he was a star, but he always played his hardest.
That's cool.
Yeah, he was known for his gritty play and his hard hits.
Awesome, when did he play.
He played during the 80s and 90s.
Was he ever in the Pro Bowl?
Yeah, I think he was in it once.  He was the first ever special team pro bowl selection, if I am remembering correctly.
Nice!  What number did he wear?
He was number 40.  I have a jersey of his.
That's really cool, it sounds like you are really a fan of his.
I really am.  I would love to meet him.
That would be cool, what would you say to him?
I
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are we going out tonight? Trivia perhaps?
That sounds good. They have a NFL trivia night at one of our local hangouts.
Oh yeah we could give them a run for their prizes and cash!
Let's practice a little with a few fun ones you have stashed.
Who used to stuff his shoes with tootsie rolls in socks because he said it made him run fast?
That would be Darrell Green, one of the fastest men in the history of the NFL
Nice! NFL moved the Superbowl XXVII from Arizona to California in protest of Arizona’s refusal to celebrate Martin Luther King Day
That's not right.Why in the world would Arizona do that and risk the revenue loss and upset fans for disrespecting MLK.
What does Steve Smith of the Ravens do after every game?
Oh I know this one. He leaves his  cleats on the field to raise awareness about homeless people without shoes
Here's an overachiever for you. here was a Supreme Court Justice, Byron White who was also an NFL player (3x all-pro). In addition to that he was also an WWII vet (2 bronze star medals), a Rhodes Scholar, and a member of the College Football Hall of Fame
Who did he play with?
Detroit Lions and I think first he played with the Pirates. I will have to check that one for sure.
Hey I have one for you. What happens if a NFL player gives a fan the game ball?
They are fined $5000.
Heck that's chump change for most of those players.
How long do you think an actual NFL game is in regular time?
I know that a lot of other stuff goes on but I am guessing 1 hour maybe.
This will blow your mind. A Football Match Lasts Only About 11 Minutes!
No way! What a rip off!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Detroit Lions get a new quarterback?
No they still have the same one.
What his name?
Their quarterback is Matthew Stafford
Oh that is right.
He is good.
Who are their other players?
Eric abron is the tight end.
I have never heard of him.
He is a really good value to the team.
What are the teams colors?
It is like a teal blue.
I like that color.
I do too.
I think all the football colors are good.
I do too I just do not like the throwback uniforms.
Really? I like them.
Some of them are ackward.
Yeah but it is cool when they wear them.
I agree

Man summers are so boring !!  I can not wait until football season
I hear you brother  . I ll gladly trade mowing the lawn for sitting at the bar drinking beer watching games
Who is going to win the NFC . Oh nevermind I know who you got
Of course Dallas all the way baby  . No one can stop Dak  and  Zeke
Dak Prescott is so overated it is ridiculous  . Ezekiel Elliott  is the real deal though. Jerry Jones will never win again . He has the Switzer curse going
hahaha   in 1996 The  Cowboys won the Super Bowl in spite of Switzer not because of him .
Sorry dude you guys aren t even going to win the division  . it is the Giants year
Talk about over rated  The Manning family and especially Eli are the definition
He will have 1 last great year  . Hear me now believe me later
Mannings last great year will be his first . What a bum
All right  All right I can see this is going nowhere . You think anyone can beatthe Patriots in the AFC ?
Its going to be tough because the AFC Championship game always  ends in Foxboro  but yes Brady is too old
I agree  I dont think  Coach Belichik is hungry anymore either . He is hollywood now
If the kid out of Clemson is even halfway good the Texans will go to the Super Bowl . QB play was Houston's only weakness
always goes back to coaching O" Brien is a lousy coach . He will screw Watson up  and he won t get the Texans out of the 1st round
You know nothing about football  !!  Alright genius  ell me who is going to win the AFC
You ll laugh but if it happens  Im going to be very rich  . odds will be like 20 to 1 at least
oooo  I am intrigued . I always love a live under dog . Who ya got ?
The Jacksonville Jaguars  . it will be the Tom Coughlin Bowl  remember he coached the Giants . Best coach in football and Leonard Fournette will be the best running back since Walter Payton
You need a  refund on that crystal ball  . iwill repeat myself when i can stop laughing .  You know nothing  about football  !!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think this upcoming NFL season will be good?
Absolutely! I think this season is going to be the best yet.
Who do you think may have a good season with the NFL this year?
Statistically, the patriots are strong.
This season I am going to stay strong with my favorite team in the NFL, the Steelers!
The Steelers do seem to have a good line up.
Do you like the new rule changes in the NFL this season?
Yes, I think the newer rules will make the players safer and the game more interesting.
I really am tired of seeing the Patriots in the super bowl.
I am too. I think everyone is, except maybe Patriots fans.
I do not care for the seahawks either. How about you?
No, another team I am tired of seeing. As well as the Cowboys.
Oh Yeah! The cowboys are terrible but they used to be a great team. Do you think?
They have bad management and a bad coach.
I agree, I am a Steeler fan though so I am a bit biased. Steelers have a great team.
Steelers are good, but i am a ravens fan. They are pretty strong too.
Over all this NFL season with the changes should be more interesting.
I think so too, I just hope they get the players out that continously cause issues.
Yeah, Some of them are gonna cause a player to get hurt badly.
I agree though, This will be a memorable NFL season
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
I am always ready for some NFL football.
I hear you. I have been watching replays in the off season.
Me too.
Except the Superbowl. I can't bare that one again.
Oh, no. Me either. But we are starting fresh in just a few weeks.
That goodness.
I know. There is going to be a target on Atlanta's back though.
For sure. They are going to have to prove themselves all over again.
I know. We don't want them to look like a big joke.
I think we have a shot.
I do too. I just don't want that kind of let down again.
True fans will stick through it all though.
I am not going anywhere.
I know. I may get mad, but I am not bailing.
Me either. I will always be an Atlanta Falcons fan.
Yes, and I will breed my children to be too.
I already started that. My kids watch all the time.
Well, I don't have kids yet.
Oh, yeah. It fun to watch football with the little ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like about football?
NFL or college football?
NFL
Oh, good, because I prefer professional football to college football.
Why?
I don't know.  Calliber of play I suppose.
Is that it?
No. I guess it is also because I like getting to know the players and cheering for the same ones year after year.
Yeah, but so many of them move from team to team. Doesn't that bother you?
It used to bother me, but not anymore.  I watch many different teams,  and it is a delightful surprise when I find a player that I once liked on one team make a place for himself on a new team.
I guess it is like that in life...
You can say that again!  I have had four different jobs in 10 years.
Really?  Why?
The first company closed down, the second job was temporary, the third job was with a state agency that ran out of money, and the foruth was a start-up made out of others that had lost jobs in the horrible Obama economy.
Sounds rough.
Well, I learned something new at each company, met new friends, and stayed alive.
Are you employed now?
I'm trying to get a job with an NFL franchise.
You are too old to be a player!
True, and I was never good enough for the NFL, but I would wash towels just to be associated with my favorite franchise!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How can you be a Patriot fan?
Come on, they have created a dynasty!
Yeah but at what cost?
Don't be a hater
Well then don't support cheaters
Cheaters?! They just have a lot of great players, that's why they beat your team.
Bill Belichick literally said, " if you're not cheating you're not really trying" so don't pretend they don't cheat.
Hey, the get rings.
Yes but we'll never know if they would have won them without cheating.
Brady, Gronk, stats don't lie, they are stacked with phenomenal players
I agree, I'll never doubt that, but we can't know just how good because of the cheating that they were caught doing and confessed to. There is probably more we'll never even know about
They probably would have still won all of those Super Bowls
I think so too. But we'll never KNOW. worse yet is that Brady, Belichick, the whole Patriots team will never know,
I guess you're right, that would drive me crazy to not know without a shadow of a doubt that I was the best team, player of all time.
Right, people will always dispute that and with just cause.
Man that's got to stink, because they are all so good
I agree, but you know what? It's not just a stain on the patriots organization
No one else was implicated in the cheating
No, but the NFL didn't really punish them justly so a lot of people have lost interest and respect for the game
You have a point. It's the fight among America
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you watch football?
Oh yes, I love Manchester United.
No, I mean American football, not soccer.
Oh, well we call our game "football" in England, not "soccer."
Well do you want me to explain American football to you?
Okay, go ahead.
Well, despite the name "football" only the punter and kicker really kick the ball.
Whats the difference between the punter and the kicker?
Well the kicker kicks field goals and the punter punts the ball to the other team.
What is a field goal?
When a team kicks the ball through the big yellow uprights they get three points.
I see. Why does the punter punt the ball to the other team?
Well if the team with the ball doesn't advance it 10 yards in 3 tries they can either punt it to the other team or try again to get the needed yardage.
So why don't they try again every time instead of punting?
If they don't make it on the fourth try the other team gets better field position.
What's field position?
That is a measure of how close a team is to the end zone.
What is the end zone?
That's the other way to score, if you bring the ball to the end zone it's a touchdown worth 6 points.
That seems a lot more complicated than our football!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Saints roster for training camp?
Yeah, It looks good, I think Brees is going to have a great year.
They are in a tough division though.
Not really, the NFC isn't looking all that strong this year.
Who do you think is going to win the NFC South?
The Saints, probably, but its going to be a tight one.
What about the NFC North?
Green Bay has got that division locked up for sure.
Yeah, Rodgers is no joke, he's easily the best quarterback in that division,
Don't count out Detroit though.
Who do you have winning the Super Bowl?
I really like Denver this year.
I think Kansas City is a better team.
Maybe, but they just don't have the depth to take them into the post-season.
Don't count out Pittsburg.
No Doubt, they are always late playoff contenders.
Who do you have winning the NFC?
I'm sticking with New Orleans, my man.
I think it's going to be Washington.... everyone is going to sleep on them and they are going to catch fire late.
No way, not out of that division. Dallas wont let them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you ready for the falcon game?
Yeah i can't wait.
Do you know who they are up against?
I think the NE Pats.
The patriots?
Yeah you think they will win?
I'm not sure what do you think?
Maybe who knows.
I do like tom brady
Oh yeah, i saw a video on him on youtube
What was it about?
How far he can throw a ball.
Really how far was it
I think it was like 250 yards
Wow he must have a cannon arm.
Yeah he's a very good QB.
However i'm going with the falcons
I'm going with the pats.
We will see who will win
I guess we will.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were the Cleveland Indians once an NFL team?
Yes, there were several teams with that name in the early days of the NFL.
How did that come to be?
The baseball team named the Cleveland Indians started in 1915. The football team wanted to keep the tradition alive.
So, they named their football team similarly?
Yes, but that's not the only reason.
Why else?
Many early professional football players were Native Americans.
Why was that?
I'm not sure. But, it probably relates to the fact that Jim Thorpe was from the Sac and Fox Nation.
Wow, that's interesting!
Yes, and at one point, Thorpe had an NFL team comprised entirely of Native Americans.
What team was that?
They were called the Oorang Indians.
Where were they based?
It was in LaRue, Ohio.
Where's that?
It's near Marion, Ohio. Marion is in between Toledo and Cleveland.
I never heard of it!
Yes, it's the smallest town to ever have an NFL franchise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Patriots are going to be the best team again this year!
i have to agree with you, nobody is better than Tom Brady.
I love their additions this offseason.
I think the best pick-up was Brandon Cooks.
Cooks gives them an added speed dimension they haven't had since Randy Moss.
People also forget they are getting Gronk back.
Unbelievable, that they were able to win the Super Bowl without Gronk.
It's almost like they're adding the best tight end in the league as a free agent.  He missed most of the year last year.
I love watching Gronk play - he's unstoppable.
A total mismatch at tight end.
We're forgetting they haven't lost anyone good and they upgraded at running back.
I agree, Gillisee is an upgrade over Blount.
Gillisee is a well rounded player, he can catch, he's big and he can block.
You forgot, a healthy Dion Lewis is a mismatch at times.
I also like Burkhead.
I'd be willing to be that they will move him all over the formation.
They are so loaded on offense, they're 3rd stringers would start for most teams.
Possible they go 16-0 this year.
We forgot to mention Belicheck.
The greats coach in NFL history.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow the National Football League?
Yes, I do. Do you?
Yes, I do. What's your favorite team?
I like the Arizona Cardinals.
I like the Seattle Seahawks.
I enjoy the rivalry between the two teams.
I do as well. They tied last year.
Yes, they did. I enjoyed that game very much.
It was a game of incompetence.
I agree, but it was still a good game.
The first ended in a tie.
Yes, and the Cardinals won the second.
Do you think the Cardinals will win the West this year?
I don't know. It's Larry's last year.
Who is Larry?
Larry Fitzpatrick. The wide receiver.
He's a Hall-Of-Fame player.
Yes, I believe so.
Do you think they will do well for his last year?
I hope so, yes. They should.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, how are your Broncos going to do this season?
I think Lynch is ready to step up, man.
Is he even the starter, officially?
No, but he's been looking good in camp.
Gotcha. That defense is still gonna be sick, I'm sure.
No doubt. Von Miller is all you need.
Super Bowl MVP, man. His performance was sick!
One of the best I've ever seen. That strip sack to end the game... wow.
That was amazing. What do you think of Siemean?
I think he's a good back-up QB.
What makes you think that Lynch is better than him?
I don't know. Just something about the way his mechanics are.
Just a gut feeling? I bet Matt Ryan had a gut feeling in last year's Super Bowl too.
Boy, was that an embarrassment. I still think the Packers would have beat both of them.
I guess we'll never know, considering Rodgers is always being beat in the playoffs.
He needs a better defense. It's just like with Brees.
Yeah, Brees' talent going to waste for the last half a decade has been criminal.
Yeah, ever since their Super Bowl win, it's been downhill.
True. But I'll catch you next month at a bar for the first preseason game.
Sounds good, man. Broncos going for that second ring in three years!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever gone to an NFL game?
I haven't. Have you?
Yes. I love going to live games.
Would you say it's fun for people who don't know a lot about football?
I think the exciting atmosphere makes it fun for anyone.
I always wondered how the kids would like it.
I see kids getting very involved. I think it depends how far away they are.
True. I feel like if the seats were too far they would be bored.
NFL games are a great family event, though. It's fun to paint your faces and get into it.
Are the tickets expensive?
It varies greatly.
Depending on where you sit?
That and other factors. Playoff games and the Super Bowl are more expensive.
I've always wanted to see a Super Bowl live.
Yeah, those tickets are very expensive and highly sought after.
I've always liked the Chargers. Maybe I will look into buying some tickets soon.
You should. If you buy some early season tickets it won't be expensive.
That way I'll be more likely to get some good seats, also.
Yes. The Chargers are looking like they'll do better this year, too.
That's awesome to hear about my favorite team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like best about the NFL?
I like playing games with the local newspaper to guess the winner of the games.
That sounds like fun.
It's like fantasy football, but with the local paper.
How do you win?
You guess which teams will win.
Does the person with the highest score win a prize.
Yep, a few dollars and a lot of pride.
How do you know who to predict.
I watch a lot of NFL games on TV and get the gist of things.
Who is your team?
The Broncos are my team.
Who is their prospect this year?
Garrett Bolles is looking good for them.
What team does he come from?
He is a recruit out of Utah.
What position does he play?
He is an outstanding blocker.
That will sure help the Broncos.
Absolutely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there's a certain age where footballer's are just too old to play?
Unfortunately yes, because as you age, you tend to suffer injuries more.
I read about an ex NFL player who is 48 and attempting a comeback in football.
Why would someone want to play when they are past their prime?
His name is Todd Marinovich, he played for the LA Avengers over a decade ago.
Why did he leave football in the first place?
He's had substance abuse problems all his life.
Drugs really ruin an athlete's career.
He originally signed with the Raiders, but was cut before starting from failing drug tests.
I don't know why athletes do drugs when they know how strict the testing is.
He was arrested just last year over a public scene where he had drugs.
So what makes him think he should try and play football?
He says he's clean now, and since recovery has changed his life, he thinks it would have that same positive effect on his football playing.
Where is he going to play football?
He's competing for a job with the SoCal Coyotes. They are part of the World Developmental Football League.
He has to compete for a job huh? I bet there will be a lot of younger less riskier competitors.
It said he will be drug tested every week.
Maybe so, but the long term affects of being a drug user are hard on the body.
He supposedly does talks at schools and stuff about how dangerous drugs are.
I'd be more likely to listen to someone though that has been clean a long time, rahter than someone who used a long time and has only been clean a year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whos the fastest player in the NFL?
Darrell Green.
Is he faster then Randy Moss?
I think so.
Did you hear Todd Marinovich is trying to make a comeback?
No, isn't he isn 50's?
48, but close enough.
Why don't players just stay retired?
Would you walk away from a job where you make millions to throw and catch a ball?
Good point, but I mean they go through a lot of pain.
They certainly do.
I wonder how good of shape they have to stay in.
Probably really good shape.
Well, I can barely stay in shape, anyways.
Its been sixteen years since he played for the avengers.
Thats what I mean.
Didn't he get in trouble for marijuana?
Yes, but so did michael phelps.
Good point.
I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I suppose you're counting down the minutes until the new NFL season, am I right?
You bet! I can't wait.
Do you think the same old team will rise to the top? The Tom Brady team?
It;s a pretty good bet. He is a great player.
A great player that cheats.
He doesn't cheat.
Deflategate anyone?
They didn't prove it.
Oh please, he cheated. They all do.
What do you know about it?
I know that Brady is married to Giselle, that Ben Afflec seems to be in love with him, and that people cheat to get ahead.
Well, I can't argue with that logic.
You got that right!
I'm sure they even cheated at the very first Olympics games back in ancient Greece.
Probably. They found loaded dice on an acrhiological dig in the Holy Land. People always cheat.
I wouldn't doubt it.
Thing is, a skilled player is a skilled player even without cheating. So the NFL should really crack down.
Other than testing there's not much they can do.
They'd stop cheating so much if every time they were caught the indvidual player and the entire team had not be fined but have $5,000,000 per year taken out of their salaries in perpetuity.
That might just do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Matt Stafford is my favorite quarterback in the NFL, he just knows how to win games.
It's been a long time since a Detroit Lions fan could say that about their quarterback. Stafford definitely has been looking really good.
Did you watch the games last year against Green Bay as well as the final stretch of the games to end the season?
Yeah I did, Stafford was awesome in those games. He basically willed them to those wins.
He needs more offensive weapons though.
You don't like their current wide receivers or running backs?
I'm okay with them because they're still young and growing. Another year of experience and this season we'll see if they truly are game changers.
They're offensive line is really good! One of the best in the NFL in my opinion.
I agree the Lions have a really good offensive line. That's why Stafford gets to do what he does so well because of the time he gets from his offensive line.
Darius Slay looks good for them too and he's coming back stronger than before I heard.
Darius is one of the games best cornerbacks. I always feel confident when he's on the opponents best wide receivers. I know he challenged Julio Jones well when they matched up and he's such a game changer forcing turnovers in the secondary too.
I really like him and think the Lions really did well finding him.
Marvin Jones and Golden Tate are returning so that's promising for me. I thought they did really good as the Lions main wide receivers.
Golden Tate was always dependable in Seattle for the Seahawks. I'm glad to see him get to be the main guy over there in Detroit.
Yeah he's been terrific for Stafford. He's always getting open or he'll come back to help Stafford on broken plays.
I've seen him bail the Lions out of so many broken offensive plays.
Marvin Jones really spaces and spreads the field so Golden Tate gets a lot of room to operate underneath.
People are sleeping on Eric Ebron. When he was healthy he was one of the best tight ends in the league.
I hope he can stay healthy this season. It'll help out the Lions a lot.
I can see the Lions probably going 10-6 this season and fighting for that playoff spot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey when does the NFL pre-season start this year?
I don't know, but I know it's in August.
Let me see if I will be able to find out the exact date; hold on. It starts up with the Hall of Fame game on August 3rd.
Oh, okay. Who is playing that game?
Looks like the Cowboys will be playing Arizona.
Ok. Hey, remember the Hall of Fame game between the Packers and Colts was canceled last year?
Yes, I do remember, it was supposedly because of field conditions.
Yeah, that was the reason. Hopefully that doesn't happen again.
Right. Who you going for this year?
I have to stick with Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Do you really think they have a chance for the superbowl?
Nothing is impossible, they just signed Sean Renfree as their quarterback.
Alright. Didn't he play for the Atlanta Falcons.
Yes, he was drafted by the Falcons in the 2013 NFL draft out of Duke.
Okay, well, we will have to see if he can make it happen.
Like I said anything is possible; who you rooting for?
Green Bay Packers.
No way.
Yes way. I am a loyal fan regardless of my team's performance.
That's cool. Well good luck and our teams will be seeing each other on Dec. 3rd at 1:00 pm. ET
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you want to talk about?
How about the nfl?
Sounds good to me
I love football
Me too
Its definitely the best sport
I agree
Who do you like
I like the titans
They are pretty good
What about you
The steelers
Oh, i like them too
They are a great team
They are
And the have good players
Absolutely
Good talking to you
You too
Thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think it's just a matter of time the NFL will have women coaching their teams.
Yeah, I think it could happen any day now.
Why do you say that? You heard something I haven't?
No but they're allowing women reporters in the locker rooms so its-
I think the reporters in the locker room thing is about marketing more than its about NFL football.
There are many more women sports newscasters than ever so its just a matter-
Again, I don't think the NFL-
But there are women coaches in the NBA right?
You mean the WNBA don't you?
If women can coach NBA or WNBA then they coach NFL teams.
I believe its gonna happen but first you'll hear about a women's investment group owning a NFL team.
So it won't be about NFL football? It'll be about money and investments?
It'll be about women participating in NFL's business decisions and that will bring about remale coaching change.
I wonder why it has not happen yet?
NFL is an old boy's club and traditions are hard to break.
That's why I know it'll happen soon the NF-
Is still dominated by men who resist change.
You know if more male coaches in the NFL would open themselves up to change-
women would takeover the one place men can go and still bond.
You, like the NFl need much helpt and much prayer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Bills firing Rex Ryan?
I don't think he got a fair shot at the tem.
Well he shouldn't have shot his mouth off on a playoff promise.
Yeah but he only had two seasons.
I agree two seasons is a short time but he has had other problems.
What do you mean?
Well he allowed way too many touchdowns.
His defense was his downfall.
Do you think the Bills will have a better season.
Well I think they might but again, it is a rebuilding process all over again.
How many games do you think they will win?
I say they win the first game and then lose the next two.
But do you think the new coach will allow two consecutive losses?
Well it would be a tough loss but I think they lose the next two by 10.
And the first score.
They will win by only 7.
So one touchdown for the win.
Yes or a field goal.
I think they will win by 21.
They don't have a chance to win the first game by three touchdowns.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seahawks and Chargers going head to head beginning of Pre-Season.
I saw that. Interesting.
You think it will be a good game?
Well, they both have strong stats nd bot teams pretty much have the same players.
Yup.
An no injuries on either team, the camps look good.
So a game worth watching?
I'm not a fan of either but if they broadcast it after the Tampa/Miami game i'd watch it.
Right on!
I think there will be a little sizzle to that game.
Titans and Jets on Week 1.
Yes, i think the Titans will dominate that game.
You think?
Yes. Titans are looking good in camp play. The Jets..... not so much.
Ah, you have been catching some of the camp play?
Yes, NFL Network is desperate for programming so they will show anything.
HA! So true! Last week they did the Top 10 Players shoes!
That's a riot. Very funny.
You'll know which teams will be performing if they do OT in Pre-Season.
For sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite NFL team these days?
You know I love my Cincinnati Bengals!
I know, that makes me feel sorry for you!
Whatever, I think we have a very bright future ahead of us!
Not until management finally decides to fire Marvin Lewis you don't.
I do not think that is fair, he has gotten us to the playoffs year after year.
That s true, however, he is 0-7 when he gets to the playoffs!
Trust me, I know all about his lack of playoff success.
I feel like getting to the playoffs is a nice accomplishment; but at some point you have to win a couple, right?
I know, I just feel like at some point he will break through and make a nice run.
Well, he has had very talented teams over the years and still come up empty in the playoff win column.
I feel like some of the blame has to fall on the quarterback position as well.
I am not sure about that, Andy Dalton is actually pretty good.
He is, but I feel like he could be more consistent throughout the season.
He played his college football at TCU and even won a Rose Bowl.
What does that have to do with anything?
It just shows that he can lead a winning program to great post season success.
I get what you are saying, hopefully he can rack up some playoff wins before his career is over.
Well, he has got one of the best receivers in the game to help him along.
That is true! I think we will be be much better in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Marshawn coming back to play for the Raiders?
I think it's great. Really. Beast mode. I think it's good for the NFL.
Agreed. I just hope he still has his legs. You know, folks saying he's getting older.
Yeah. I can understand that. I guess we'll see. I'm thinking it's good he got a few years rest. Maybe he's still got some juice in him.
Beast mode! I'm just pumped. I think he adds a level of fun to the game that before the NFL has tried to stop.
Yeah. Agreed. I'm just worried things might get out of hand in Oakland.
Oh. I know, right? Those are some sick fans. Still, it's gotta be good for the community. Folks seeing that he came from the city. All that.
Yup. My only real beef with Oakland is that stadium. Man, that place is a dump.
True. It's unfortunate. Even worse. Now they'll be leaving for Vegas. Who can really blame them, though. It's a true dump.
Yeah. You think players will get into trouble in Vegas? I mean, with betting and the lifestyle and all that?
No. Not really anything more than the usual. I bet they'll have some good parties, though. Maybe some better stories about going out to the club.
Ha! Agreed. I think it'll be alright, too.
Hopefully Carr is healthy this year. Just a shame about the injury.
I know. It's too bad. But yeah, things are looking good for the Silver and Black.
Raider Nation!
Ha! A true fan, ay? That's cool. I just want to see them compete. Play hard. All that.
Not me. I want them to push farther than last year at least. It ended up a disappointing season.
I disagree. I think it just show how important it is to have depth. Obvious example, look at Dallas.
True, true. Dak was just ridiculous.
Yup. But I mean, that's why I think it's just key to have depth. Even at QB.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Bo, did you by chance record that football game from a few days ago.
Oh yeah, was it the Saints game?
It was indeed, them vs. the Colts I believe.
I got it, I am actually glad you asked me to record it.
Why is that bro?
It was an excellent game, the Saints have a great squad.
Oh definitely, I root for them every time out.
What is that young running back's name who is an absolute play maker?
There are a few, but maybe Hightower?
Oh yeah Hightower is incredible!
He definitely goes on runs when he wants to.
Him and the quarterback seem to have good synergy.
I can't disagree, you definitely did enjoy the game.
I did, and can you remind me of the quarterback's name.
Drew Brees, he will go down as an all time great.
Oh surely, I remember when the Saints weren't that great but that has all changed.
They are definitely a formidable squad now.
We see eye to eye, come through and we can watch the game.
You wouldn't mind watching it again?
Not at all, I'm a Saints fan now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Oh my God, I am getting so excited about the Saints season.
Me too. But I'm looking at everything with cautious optimism.
I totally get it. I am too. When you finished 7-9 the past three seasons, you can't overly excited.
Unfortunately, I do tend to get overly excited, and it seems to always lead to disappointment
I think we were spoiled when we won the Super Bowl.
Yeah, we got used to winning. And we expected it to be that way every year from that point on.
We did have a couple of good seasons after that but then things started going south.
Well, we did have a lot of injuries.
True. But all teams have injuries. I'm sure the Patriots have injuries every year, but they seem to have people that can step right in and play.
I'm really excited to see Adrian Peterson in action.
Me too. I think he and Mark Ingram make a great pair. I just hope they can both stay healthy.
And let's not forget Drew Brees. I honestly have so much confidence in him. He's getting older, sure, but I still think he has a few years before he calls it quits.
This will be an interesting year for both he and Sean Payton. If we have another losing season, Payton's gone.
What about Brees? Won't he be a free agent?
I think so. I would not be surprised if we draft a quarterback in the 2018 draft, and not just a back-up.
Drew's heir apparent?
Yeah, and the day Drew is no longer with the Saints is the day is go into a very deep depression.
I think this whole city will go into a deep depression.
Well, we can't think about that now. We have to think about the upcoming season. And that first game against the Vikings. Oh my God, we have got to win that first game.
I know. And can you imagine the hype, with AP returning to Minnesota. Plus it's Monday Night Football. I can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of players entering the NFL
what do you mean?
like, do you think they are as good as the people already drafted?
probably not, to be honest, but that's not really their fault.
yeah, people who are drafted are relatively young, aren't they?
yeah, i think a lot are between 18 and 25.
some are even drafted out of high school.
yeah, but not a lot, only the best.
yep, why do you think they draft so young?
probably to keep people around the longest.
yeah, and the fact that younger people are more agile and quick.
not all the time, though, some older players are still better than the young ones.
like who?
you know, the legends - brady, farve, etc.
i feel like some people in the NFL have a natural knack at it, though.
that's because they do, everyone has a natural talent somewhere.
and for some it's football!
yeah, except they still have to retire eventually.
well i'm interested to see who gets drafted next.
me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will go far this year and make it to the Super Bowl.
Well of course the Patriots.
I think the Seahawks will.
I do too.
I also think the Giants.
Yeah they are good.
I think the Steelers will make it in.
They are good.
Who else do you think?
I think the Atlanta Falcons may go all the way.
What about the Cowboys?
They had an awesome team last year.
I think they can maybe win it.
If Andrew Luck is healthy the colts may go far.
Hopefully they deserve a break.
I agree. They need to do better.
I think that the panthers will do better.
I hope so they let me down last year.
Me too.
We shall see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What position in an NFL team do you think is the best?
Uu that's a hard question. Hmm the QuarterBack?
Well Quarter Back couldn't work without a Receiver.
That's true, and we can't forget about the Running Games.
What about the Defensive players?
Yeah, they are very important.
The big guys on the line are the one that make a lot of the big play.
Yeah, interceptions and sacks.
The special team are also important.
Haha you can't forget about the kicker and the punter.
And the long snapper.
Haha, he is always the one people make fun of, but no one can do their jobs.
Did you know that the tight end is the worst paying position in the game.
Really, that's surprising. What about Gonk?
Well, he's an outlier.
Yeah well, they are still a team.
Yeah and no one can work alone.
Yeah but they still do need a leader.
So then I vote for the Coach!
Haha, that's correct!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't wait for this season!
I know, right?
What do you think the Falcons will do?
Tough to say, that was a brutal loss.
You think they'll be impacted by the Super Bowl loss?
I don't see how they are not.
What about the Patriots?
They're getting old but you can't count them out.
You think this will be Brady's last season?
Not sure but I would not be shocked.
You like any sleeper teams this year?
I don't think you can ever sleep on the Giants.
That's true, Eli still has some left and the addition of Marshall will help.
I just wonder if OBJ will mesh with Marshall.
Yeah, he is a bit of a prima donna.
Big time prima donna.
Alright, final prediction for the Super Bowl?
I like the Steelers and the Giants.
Hmm, interesting, well I can't wait.
Yep, September can't come soon enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The only thing I don't like about summer, no NFL.
I agree. So what team will you go with after Oakland moves to Vegas?
That's going to be really horrible. I've been an Oakland fan my whole life. I guess a Vegas Raiders fan.
Is that the name they will be using?
I'm not sure. I don't think they have released the name details yet, but they usually keep the team name and just change the city.
True. When are they actually supposed to start playing there?
Not until 2020. It takes awhile to build a stadium.
That's really not that long though considering all of the work.
I'm curious how they plan to play in that heat.
I assume they will have an enclosed dome like the Arizona Cardinals do.
You're probably right. No one could play in that heat without having serious problems.
It would give them a great home advantage like Minnesota has for weather though.
That and Green Bay. I don't know how they stand to be in that cold weather anymore than the heat.
They get used to it like Denver player do with the thinner air because of altitude.
I don't think I would want to go all the way to Vegas to see games though.
It's not that far away is it?
It's a pretty good trip by car but there are short flights from Los Angeles to Vegas all day that aren't too expensive.
There were so many teams in California though that it's probably better for the team that they got out.
True, and they will be the only team in Nevada so hopefully they will get a better fan following.
Derek Carr made out better by staying with them because his taxes on his pay will be much lower.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are we going to see in the Super Bowl this year?
Patriots of course!
I don't know there are a lot of teams that loaded up in the off season.
Brady and Belichick are a winning formula.
Brady isn't a spring Chicken, getting closer to 40 every year.
So is every other quarter back in the league. Belichick has a plan. He's the greatest coach in the history of the sport.
You mean his plan to cheat?
All the teams cheat. It's part of a winning strategy.
They may all cheat but New England is the only one that's been caught multiple times.
When you win everyone wants to find something wrong with you.
So you think they are going 16 and 0 I assume?
I don't know about a sweep but 14 or 15.
Who do you think is going to give them trouble this year aside from Atlanta?
Maybe the Steelers, Kansas City?
Pittsburgh's defense is the real deal, and I think Brady is going to have a tough time with them.
I'd be surprised if we win that game, but Im not really to worried about anyone else.
So maybe 13 and 0 because you're not winning against Atlanta, and if you're worried about the Cheifs you've got to factor in that possibility.
I won't lie Atlanta is a better team, but they don't have Brady and Belichick leading the charge.
You realize they're just people, not magic in any way.
You're wrong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are going to be the worst teams in the NFL this year?
I think the Bears will be a poor team.
Surely you can think of other bad teams!
Yes, I also think the Ravens will have a down year.
Why do you think that?
They haven't been great recently, and have a tough division in the AFC.
How do you think the 49ers will do?
I think that they will have a rough season.
Why do you think that?
Ever since Harbaugh left, they have been in shambles.
What do you think about their recently retired players??
A shame, but I can understand why it happened.
Yeah, football is a brutal sport, especially in the NFL.
This is true, as brain injuries seem to be the focus now.
And rightfully so! We have a long way to go.
Hopefully NFL head gear and awareness will keep increasing.
So who are your picks for the super bowl?
I think Seattle and New England will be there again.
Good choices, but almost too typical.
Yes, that would be almost too easy of a road in the NFL.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team in the AFC do you think can beat the Patriots and stop them from another ring?
I think there are two that have a really good chance, Pittsburgh and Oakland.
Those two have the talent to top the AFC, but it also depends on the health of the team and how their meetings during the regular season go.
I know that Roethlisberger is nearing the end of his career because of health reasons, but he is definitely a quarterback who can take Tom Brady.
If he gets on the same page as Antonio Brown, it's touchdowns for days.
Add in their explosive running game with Bell and it's near impossible to stop them once the offense starts clicking.
It's more of the defense that I worry about with Pittsburgh, while I see so many pieces coming together for Oakland.
If Pittsburgh's offense scores a bunch of points, it doesn't really matter how their defense is, much like how the Saints are successful.
Yes, but Oakland is more of a complete package with their young QB talent, dynamic receivers and running back, as well as hungry defense.
I do think Khalil Mack should be a player that Tom Brady worries about because he is younger and more athletic than Tom, a combination that's hard to avoid when dodging sacks.
It's interesting though to see the coaches of those three AFC teams though because they all have a lot of experience.
I'm just not sure that Tomlinson or Del Rio have what it takes to out coach Belichick.
They both have a talented roster though and enough experience playing against Belichick that it may be easier to game plan.
The only thing predictable about Belichick is that he will do whatever it takes to win.
I really noticed that last preseason and beginning of the season when Tom was suspended, both backup quarterbacks executed well against some tough teams.
This is probably why Jimmy Garoppolo's trade stock is so high, even with limited professional tape.
No matter who is at quarterback, the Patriots are tough to beat with Belichick calling the shots.
Their roster also improved this year because Belichick had several good hits during both free agency and the NFL draft.
My guess is that Pittsburgh and Oakland picked up a few good guys that will address their problems and only make them more of a contender.
I would still guess that Patriots make it to the Super Bowl, unless Oakland or Pittsburgh can bring their roster to the next level.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Dallas Cowboys?
No, not at all.
I don't get why they are always talked about.
I get it, but I don't like it.
What's the reason why they are always in the national media?
Well they are called America's Team, but it's really just about money.
Ah, so they are the team that the league wants to push on people.
Exactly, and their fan base is somewhat large, so it makes sense to give them a lot of attention.
Yeah, I heard that their ticket and merchandise sales are high compared to small market teams.
That may be true, but they haven't fielded a championship team in a long time.
So they are mostly hype?
Yes, and that's what makes people mad about all the media coverage they get.
So it's all style, and no substance.
Yes, but I guess that's half of the reason why anyone gets attention in this world.
So do the Cowboys have any good players?
Their running back Ezekiel Elliott is good, but he was only a rookie last year.
How's their quarterback situation?
Dak Prescott had a solid year last season too, but he was a rookie just like Elliott.
So it's anybody's guess if they can continue their success this year?
That's the question, and usually players have a sophomore slump in their second season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like fantasy football
oh yeah
me too
i won my league last year
me too
my team was stacked
who'd did you have
leveon bell was one of my rb
he was awesome last year
had david johnson too
wow
told you my team was stacked
fantasy football is so much fun
i know right
makes you more interested in the game
sure does
gets you to pay attention to MORE games
otherwise you wouldnt pay attention to them as much
i would still
yeah me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Vikings will be giving away free tickets to the first ones to arrive to the stadium next week
Really? You don't have to be in any contests?
Nope. Free tickets to the first to show up
I have to work all next week, and really I'm not a Vikings fan
That's a shame - you should try to get  the day off
It's not worth all that
They may be a better team this year !
Why is that?
Better draft choices maybe.
Name a few of them
Dalvin Cook is really a good runningback
Yeah good choice
Pat Elflein
Yeah he's very large and 6'3" 103 lbs wonderful for their defense
Ben Gedeon was their 14th pick
Yep. Another tall, stocky one great linebacker
Rodney Adams was their 27th pick
Good wide receiver.
In all they had a pretty good draft.
Hey I may go stand in line waiting for free tickets after all !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch the NFL?
Of course I do.
What's your favorite team?
The colts, I miss Peyton.
Peyton Manning?
Yeah, he built that team I came to love.
Doesn't he still play?
I think so, for the broncos.
Still love the team.
Whose your quarterback now?
Andrew Luck.
He's good, right?
Yes, but he's no Manning.
Maybe one day he will be.
I doubt it Manning was in a league above the rest.
Him and Brady were the best.
I can't agree more.
Why did he leave.
The Colts let him go because he's old and had a neck injury.
That's unfortunate.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best NFL team?
Patriots
What city are they in?
Seriously?
Yes. I do not know.
They are the best team. How do you not know them?
I don't like football
Then why ask?
I am not sure. I just want to know
They are the New England Patriots.
Cool
They won the Super Bowl last year
Who did they play?
The Falcons
Don't the Patriots win a lot?
Yes, they have won a few Super Bowls
That is cool
It is. They have a great team
What is the name of their best player?
Tom Brady
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened during the NFL draft in April this year?
There were some big suprises including some trades up for quarterbacks
What teams were involved?
The Texans, the Chiefs and the Bears all made trades to address quarterback issues.
Who did each team get?
The Chicago Bears got Mitchell Trubisky.
Who did Kansas City obtain?
The Kansas City Chiefs obtained Patrick Mahomes
Who did the Texans obtain?
The Houston Texans obtained Deshaun Watson
Were there any particular unusual trades or records that arose?
Yes in fact it was an NFL record draft for defensive backs.
What happened on the defensive back drafting?
There was an NFL draft record 19 selections made in just the first two rounds of the draft.
Who was the top draft pick ?
The top pick was Myles Garrett drafted by the Cleveland Browns
What position does he play ?
He is a defensive end.
Who was the final draft choice ?
In round 4 with the 253rd pick the Denver Broncos chose Chad Kelly
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's good, man? How are the Chiefs looking this year?
We're looking good, man. We're looking good!
AFC is stacked this year.
Yeah. Pats, Ravens, Chiefs, Steelers...
It's going to be a great year.
NFC is looking decent too.
Oh yeah. I want Brees to win one more.
That defense, man... they're ALWAYS letting him down.
Tell me about it. He's probably, technically, the best QB in the game.
Well... he's no Tom Brady.
That's true. I'm also ready to see Lynch return.
Oh, yeah. That's gonna be sick!
He's gonna be running DOWN people.
No doubt. And then with Carr on the team...
They're looking good, for sure. Hopefully, they can do better than last year.
I think they will. Carr is just maturing.
He reminds me of Cam a lot. I hope he rebounds.
I think he will. He was really hurt a lot last year.
True that. Well, I'll hit you up next month for a preseason game.
Sounds good to me, man. See you then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that the Green Bay Packers picked up Bennett this offseason?
Yeah, I can't believe he left the Patriots though.
I think after he won his ring last year, he was just looking for a new atmosphere to play in.
It's hard to believe he has been with so many teams, I feel like every year it's someone new.
He wasn't exactly a bust in Chicago, but that squad wasn't very good so it didn't really go anywhere.
He was in Carolina too, but not many people remember that.
I had forgotten that he was a Panther for a short time, I just keep thinking about Chicago and New England.
Green Bay will be a change for him, but he will be going from one great quarterback to another.
He is so lucky that at the end of his career he will be able to say that he has caught passes from both Brady and Rodgers!
Hopefully, he will have won a superbowl with each, too!
Well, he has a better chance in Green Bay than in Chicago or New York.
I wonder why Seattle didn't take a look at him, playing with his brother would've been fun.
I think that Seattle seems set at tight end, but from a personal standpoint, he would've had fun.
I'm sure Michael would've liked sparring with him at practice!
The way they both have so much passion for the game, it's easy to see why they are both successful.
Yeah, Martellus will add an energy to the Green Bay locker room that will make them stand out.
Kind of like his brother in Seattle, right?
Both guys are so passionate, but in different ways. Martellus is much more playful in his execution.
Probably because he is on offense, rather than defense, so the energy is a bit different.
He does add something interesting to each team he has played on, so we will have to see how Green Bay uses him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's going on in the NFL?
It seems to be the same every summer, guys see these NBA contracts and all of a sudden they think that their underpaid.
I know right? When does it stop?
It is always the same type guys too, the free agents or the rookies that just signed big contracts saying they could have gotten more if they played basketball.
I think they should just go play basketball.  They thought making a 53 man roster was hard.  Try 15.
Makes me feel like they don't want to share with their teammates.
Makes me wonder if there is a point where you don't think about money and what that dollar amoutn is.
I have seen guys get guaranteed rookie contracts of more than ten million a year think that they are underpaid. And they haven't even played a single down.
Really is hard to believe.
Basic differences don't seem to mean anything. I mean 15 players versus 53, 82 games vs. 16.  What don't they understand?
Exactly, there are just more opportunities for a team to make money during a long basketball season and less people to share it with.
But that NBA money sure is unbelievable.
I know.  Those guys are killing it. But the NFL players get paid pretty well compared to how it used to be.
I know Jim Thorpe used to play for $250 a game.
I lot of guys that got drafted in the early years never even signed.
Your'e right. I know of a number one pick that took a job selling foam rubber instead of playing football.
Could you imagine that today?
Yeah I can just hear some saying "No, thanks for the offer but I would rather go work at the plant."
Not going to happen.
Definitely not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who for you is the most disappointing QB ever?
Ever? Greatest rolls off the brain easy, but most disappointing? That one's tough.
I would have to say that Johnny Manziel by the Browns is mine.
I nearly forgot he played for them. I'm going to say Jay Cutler.
Cutler took the bears to the playoffs, why him?
I would say its more like the Bears took him to the playoffs...
Lol, I can see that. But why Cutler?
It's just that he seems to struggle when the stakes are high, he throws Ints and fumbles, like he forgot how to play..
Yeah, I like the Lions,but Stafford has some games like that too.
Ok, what about Mark Sanchez?
Oh yeah, he's a lot like Cutler, but with him it feels like overconfidence gets him more.
Yeah, the team, whether its the Jets or the Eagles, get rolling and it is fumble or interception time for him.
Yeah, I see him miss the Safety on deep throws all the time. Cutler is more inconsistent, but usually he misses a Blitz and goes down.
That was a problem for Kaepernick too at times. He wants to rush or holds it too long trying to make a play happen.
That's a big peeve of mine, so many times the plays that just wreck the game for the team are those "make a play" ones.
I know, you need to be able to say when a play has failed and throw it away and regroup.
To me, that's the mark of  a great vs. bad qb. Saying "nope, not gonna happen today" when they need to.
I agree, I also think the greats are good at shaking off the mistakes.
No doubt! Sanchez threw an INT or Cutler would and then the next set would be another turnover.
I know, but with Manning, he'd look awful for 3 downs, and then when the ball is back in his hands it's like it never happened.
XXXXXXXXXXX
are you ready for the new season to start
season of what
nfl, it is only a few months away
oh right, i am still watching baseball
i am tired of that, bring on the football
what are your chances
with the cardinals, i dont know
do you feel better than last year
i felt good last year and see what happened
it is a new year
yeah but we did not improve enough
but palmer is still there
year, and larry
it seems like the last year
last year of what
to win
this is a good chance before they leave
i hope they at least make the playoffs
they need to
this new year starts again
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is going to win it all this year?
I would say the Patriots are still contenders.
Really? I think the Falcons have an even better chance this year.
But can they hold a big super bowl lead?
That remains to be seen.
I thikn the VIkings could be around in a major way this year.
Yea, Bradford knows the team and Cook/Murray can run
And they can play defense, unlike the rest of the north
If they dont fall apart midway through the year
5-0 to 5-5 doesnt come easily
Yea, that was a bad turn of events
Nothing they could do about it
How about the seahawks?
They werent as good last year, they will get worse this year
How about the SAints
Adrian wont have that much of an impact, he's old
Well, we wont be bored
when is the fantasy draft?
next month, post preseason
looking forward to it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your team this year?
I like the Giants this year.
Going all the way to the Super Bowl?
Oh no, maybe Dallas, then.
That Dak Prescott sure is something.
Don't forget about Ezekiel Elliot!
But how could they let Tony Romo go?
That's all he had in him.
I guess that's true.
Who else made moves this off-season?
The Raiders are literally moving in a couple of years.
Oh, that's right! Las Vegas!
Would that be good for the team?
I can't say, but it seems to be good for business.
Just when you think Oakland is the new hot spot for sports, huh?
Well they got couple of years and also Marshawn Lynch!
Oh man! They're a must-watch now.
They also paying their quarterback $125million for 5 years.
Wow! Las Vegas!
Las Vegas indeed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Colts?
I think they're an above average team.
I think they're better than that.
Maybe, I think they're still too young.
That's a good point.
I think they can grow though.
Do you think they could ever be a superbowl team?
Definitely maybe in another five years.
Think it will really take that long?
I do, they're young and inexperienced.
Can't Andrew Luck just carry the team?
He's not experienced enough to do that yet.
Do you think Luck could be as good as manning?
I don't think so Manning is just too good.
Do you think he could be as good as say Favre?
yes in skill, for sure.
Do you think he could break any records.
Anything is possible.
I like him and hope he grows.
I agree a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like watching the NFL?
Yeah I do.
Cool same here.
Do you have a favorite team?
The bills.  How about you?
The Raiders
That's cool.  Where do you watch most games?
I usually watch them at the house.  You?
I like to go out for the games.  Either to a bar or to one of my friends' places.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah it is.  We usually try to do it up big.
Like bbq and all that?
Yeah we'll cook out and have some nice beers for the game.
That sounds great.
Yeah I can't wait for football season to start up again.
Yeah I feel the same.
Good chatting.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your predictions for this year's football season?
College or pro?
The NFL. Who do you think will win the Super Bowl?
I think it is the NFC's year.
Are you serious? Who in the NFC could actually beat the Patriots?
Oh, so you automatically think the Patiots will be the AFC champion?
Actually, yes I do, but I don't know that there's any NFC contender who could beat the Raiders either.
The Raiders? Didn't they fizzle out last year?
Only after their quarterback broke his leg! Carr was awesome last year.
Ok fine, but that doesn't mean anything for this year.
Except for the fact that the Raiders now have Marshawn Lynch too.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, that also makes them a force!
But I thought you were all about the Patriots?
Well, given the way they traded and drafted, I am. I'm just saying I don't see any NFC contenders that will be better.
I think this is the Eagles year.
The Eagles? You must be joking!
Nope. I think it is there time.
You are delusional! They've never won a Super Bowl and they don't have the personnel to do it this year.
I think now that Wentz has a year under his belt they will surprise everyone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to an NFL game?
No, I haven't. Have you?
Yes, a few. Why haven't you gone?
I hate crowds, I hate drunk rednecks yelling, I hate the lack of space, the body heat...
Geez, quit hating.
...the cheap beer, the anti-craft beer culture, the fact that they get fined when they score a touchdown, the parking...
Okay, I get it.
So what was your experience like?
We had really good seats in the 30 yard line, about halfway in the bottom section.
Great view?
Spectacular!
So, big question: how much were the tickets?
$150 each.
See, that's another reason why I don't go. I like not going bankrupt watching a bunch of spoiled children play a game.
Where do you watch the NFL then?
Rarely will I go to a bar. Usually at my home or a friends'. Small and quiet.
Yeah, the stadiums are nothing like that.
Plus don't they take about an hour to leave?
Depends, but yeah.
I love watching NFL games, but I love peace and quiet more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the first Super Bowl you watched as a kid?
Sure do, Super Bowl XXIV
Who played in that one?
Broncos and 49ers
Who ended up winning.
49ers big time
What was the score?
55-10
55-10!
Yes, it was very embarrassing for the Broncos.
Wow that was a blow-out.
Yeah, Elway was the only hall of famer on the team.
And the 49ers?
They were stacked.
Who were some of their players
Montana, Craig, Lott, Rice, Young, Haley
Wow, that was a stacked team.
It helps when you win Super Bowls.
That it does.
Hard to get elected if you don't win the big one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so ready for football season.
Me too, I hope the Lions can win a playoff game this year.
Well they still have to go through the Packers in their division.
That is the only tough competition in the division.
Maybe, I think the Vikings will give them a run.
Are you kidding, they lost Peterson.
What? I didn't know that.
Yeah, he signed with the Saints.
The Saints!?! That seems like a strange fit.
I agree, he is more of a pound the ball runner, than a pass catcher like they like.
That is part of the fun I like about the NFL.
I like that too, the changes are fun.
Well most changes. I don't like the teams moving.
It is going to be weird to have two teams in L.A.
And one in Las Vegas.
That is going to take some getting used too, but that happens in a year or two.
Man Carr got paid by the Raiders.
Well he had an awesome year last year.
He did, too bad he got hurt.
It would have been nice to see them give the Patriots a run in the playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so sick of the Broncos fans around here.
What makes you despise them?
Perhaps it's the fact that they are just everywhere around these parts.
Probably because you don't have another football team in this market.
They are the closest team, but it's so much more than that.
Okay, well what do you hate in particular?
For one, their colors.
What's wrong with blue and orange?
I see it everywhere.  I can't go anywhere in the winter without seeing Broncos coats!
Seems like a silly reason to hate the team.
What drives me even crazier is their fanbase.
They're no different from everyone else.
Oh, but they are, much more annoying.
In what ways exactly?
For one, all they talk about was their Super Bowl victory.
It was a good win for Manning.
But see, they don't talk about getting spanked by the Seahawks.
And why would they?  That was a horrible Super Bowl to watch.
But they make up a billion excuses why they lost the game and don't just own it.
At least they've made a Super Bowl recently, that's gotta stand for something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well, sometimes in the NFL you just have to start rebuilding.
Yea, I agree, but the Seahawks are definitely not at that point yet.
Yea, I'm just trying to see that its hard to sustain winning without any period of losing.
Yea, you are right, but a few teams have done it.
Yea, well with the salary cap, it puts the pressure on making the most of your money.
Exactly, but two or three bad contracts and your team is in a bad hole.
Yea, that is why it is so important to take advantage of the draft.
Yea, teams that do that end up in bad situations from overspending in free agency.
I agree! Teams like the Redskins do that.
Yea and they haven't experienced much winning, have they?
Not at all. They sometimes have a good year or two, but never sustain anything.
I agree. Then you look at the packers who win year after year.
Yea, because they build the right way.
Yea! Have you ever seen their roster? They were almost all drafted by the team.
That is an incredible accomplishment!
Yea, not many teams can say that.
I agree! Trades and free agency fill needs. Not built teams.
Thats exactly right! The teams who realize that are most successful.
Yea, its not rocket science, but some owners and GM's just like to open up the checkbooks.
Yea, without thinking. Always a wise choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about them carolina panthers ?
Can't wait for the season to get underway !!!
I hope cam newton will be able to do a little bit more than he did last season.
Exactly.....I don't know what got into him last season....maybe he did one too many dabs.
Do you think Tom Brady will retire after this season.
Highly doubt it...he just won the superbowl....he's a freak !
I think Kelvin Benjamin is gonna go off this year
He better,  if not it might be the end of the line,  he has the talent....he just hasn't proved it all the way yet !
Did you ever watch the 85 Bears ?
Sure did,  I was 7 but I remember watching Refrigerator Perry run a yard for a TD !
The panthers have a pretty great,  not just good offensive line this season.
I agree,  Kahil, Oher, and Trai Turner have unlimited talent on the O-Line !
Thomas Davis is a pure beast....you think he'll go off this year ?
More than likely.....I knew since day one he was special.
Have you heard that Jericcho Cotchery is the new WR coach for Carolina ?
WhAAAATTTT ???? Had no idea....he'll be a good one !!!
Coach Rivera has really, truly proven that he's one of the best in the league.
ESPN...has put him in their top 5 head coaches in the league !
Do you think any team will sign Colin Kaepernick before the season starts ?
I highly doubt it....I know I wouldn't....all he is a distraction....look it's 2017....the 60's ended over 50 years ago...stop pretending you're oppressed...america doesn't buy it !
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's only two months away from the start of the season. I can't wait.
Neither can I. The season always comes up so quick.
Which rookies are you looking forward to seeing?
I'm excited to see the new batch of tuning backs most of al.
Yeah I can't wait to see how Fornette and McCaffery do.
Don't forget about Dixon, he should get a lot of playing time too.
Yeah he fell into a good spot with the Bengals. They should be better this year.
There's a lot of teams that could be a lot better. The Raiders are looking like an up and coming team.
Yeah I agreee, if Carr stays healthy they should be a Super Bowl threat.
It would be nice seeing someone other than the Patriots there.
Yeah it seems like they are good every year, but Brady can't be this good forever.
He's probably got a year or two before he starts declining.
When was the last time they didn't win their division?
I can't remember it's been so long. The Jets and Bills are a long ways away but the Dolphins are getting better.
Yeah the Jets are looking like they could be the worst team in the league.
I'd be surprised if they won four games.
They need a QB, they had a long stretch without one.
And they lost their best two receivers!
I can't believe they let Eric Decker go.
Well at least he should have someone better throwing to him now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited like I am for the new NFL season?
Yeah I can't wait - last year will be hard to top though - it was a fantastic season.
You must be a New England Patriots fan huh?
It is one of the teams I watch regularly, I am a Tom Brady fan too
I do admire him, he is a real professional and committed to his craft.
Me too, I can't understand the people who hate on him.
Me neither - as a Broncos fan - I have good reason to hate, but its hard to hate or criticize excellence.
Oh that must be tough - you Broncos fan do have a rivalry with the Patriots.
Yeah, it has been one of those - oh no we play the patriots late again this year - almost every year.
If it's not the playoffs it seems you guys always meet in the late regular season.
Yes, we knock each other out of the playoffs regularly.
Did you guys play them last year in the playoffs.
No we didn't even make the playoffs last year - It was a down year for sure.
That must have been disappointing after a super bowl win huh?
Yeah it was - thats why I could admire Brady so much though this year I guess - he didn't knock us out and go on to win
That is funny, How do you think the Broncos will do this year
At this point - I'm thinking worse than last year
No way really? Not going to make the playoffs?
Anything can happen for sure, but the division looks tough this year.
Yes, the Raiders seem to be everyones favorite
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about football?
I don't really follow it
Oh, come on!
No, really.  I don't follow it
Not even casually?
What do you mean by casually?
I mean you watch the occasional game
You mean just one game a year is casually?
Yea, sure!
Okay I watched the Super Bowl
What did you think of the game?
It was OK
Just OK?
Yea I really didn't understand what was going on
Oh I see.  So you never watch it enough to even understand the rules?
Yea pretty much
Why did you watch it then?
My brother was having a party
Oh so you went?
Yea, I like the pizza
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Andrew Luck will be ready for pre-season?
I'm not too sure, but I hope so.
Do you think we will make the playoffs this year at least?
If they can protect Andrew I think we will win it all.
I don't know about that, Robert Mathis isn't here anymore.
That's true.
We had a good draft though, and got a lot of good guys.
I just hope it's all a good fit.
Do you think T.Y. will have another amazing year?
I hope his season is as amazing as his backpacks are, haha.
Well, i just hope we win 10 games.
We should win more this year, with our new General Manager.
Yeah, that's very true.
I'm so glad we got to keep Chuck though.
This season is going to feel so weird, with a lot of veterans being gone.
Yeah, especially Patt.
I couldn't believe he retired so suddenly.
I couldn't believe it. I thought he was joking.
And to announce it on Twitter too.
I will really miss him. He was the best punter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about steroids in football?
The guys are tested now I do not think it is a problem any more.
You think so? Any other performance enhancing drugs legal?
They have a list guys get suspended all the time for it.
In the old days these guys got treated worse.
More things used to be overlooked.
They would put guys on the field who shouldn't have been.
Yes opiates for pain, cortisone injections anything to get on the field.
Many old players are suffering from it now.
Yes, did you hear the story of Jim McMahon the former bears quarterback?
No what happened?
He has a lot of pain issues now and has to do some special procedure to control pain.
That's a shame I'm concerned about the concussion thing as well.
It's a shame but I think they are doing more now to protect guys.
It is hard to see the damage until many years after most of the time.
Guys have killed themselves because of brain damage.
Lyle Alzado was the worse example of steroid use in the NFL.
He had cancer they blamed it on steroids but no proof that caused it.
It could have been something else?
Maybe it is hard to tell why someone gets cancer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is going to win the NFC West this year?
The Seahawks probably have it locked down, the rest of that division needs a lot of work.
Really? Even the niners? They had a great draft and Kyle Shanahan is going to be a great fit.
Yeah that's true, but nothing will change the fact that they still don't have a quarterback.
I wouldn't be so sure, Hoyer may surprise you.
Ha! That guy is terrible, don't defend him.
Even so, I think the niners will surprise a lot of people. I'm thinking at least 8 wins this year.
Well yeah, they have to play the AFC South so they're bound to win a few of those. I give them 6 wins.
Why only 6?
Because they have to play the rest of the NFC West 6 times and those are basically a guaranteed loss - save the rams maybe.
I dunno man, Lynch is a genius as the GM - and he just started!
Exactly, he just started and has no experience with this. What makes you think he has the right mentality for the job?
Well like I said, they killed it at the draft. I can't believe the Bears traded up for a pick that the niners weren't even going to make.
Haha yeah, I'm not sure what the bears were thinking, but I will admit that the niners did have some good picks.
Oh by the way, did you hear Marshawn wants to go to the Raiders?
Yeah it's a shame, he was such a beast on the Seahawks.
Well he grew up in Oakland so this is going to be a much better fit.
Yeah, I don't care about that though. i just want our running back to return.
Haha yeah, I do miss frank gore. This season will be interesting with hyde.
Hyde gets hurt too much to be a contender, sorry friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the older NFL player?
It's got to be Tom Brady right?
Not even close.
But he's 39 and I think the oldest was Brett Farve and he retired at 40.
You'd think that but he isn't the oldest.
The who is it? He can't be on a ppular team or I'd feel I would know who it is.
Actually he plays for the Colts.
What!? No way.
Yup, it's Adam Vinatieri.
What position does he play I don't know the guy at all.
He's a place kicker.
No wonder I don't know him.
I think play kickers are failry ignored.
Yeah they are I can confirm it. How old is he?
He is 44 years old now.
Wow thats crazy, is he any good? I mean does he still play well.
Yeah well enough to be paid millions to play the game.
Yeah I guess so. I remember when I gave Farve a hard time because of his age.
The guy is proof age is just a number.
No kidding.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think are the top four favorites for the Superbowl?
If I had to pick four I would say #1, obviously the Patriots.
Obvious, but tell me why.
Same amazing squad year, and added Cooks, Gronk back to full health.
I can't disagree with that one, they were dominant last year, and only got better.
Barring Injury, lock for the one seed, and lock for the AFC championship game.
Who is #2?
For #2 I would have to go with the Cowboys, but I am not as strong as this one.
Whys that?
Between the #2 and #6 teams, it iust a lot more close, but I'd go with the Cowboys.
Yea the cowboys were great this year, still have an amazing line, and Prescott and Zeke should only be better.
#3 would be the Falcons, offensively dominant team. Julio, Ryan, great backfield.
I might disagree you with you there and say the PAckers.
The Packers are my #4 team.
Ok I'll take that.
#5 is the Seahawks, the D is still strong, and the offense is improved.
Yea, It seems we both agree that the top half of the NFL is NFC dominant right now.
Absolutely. #6 would even be the Giants after the Marshall pick up, that is really going to provide an open field for both himself, and Odell.
Manning is likely to put up superb fantasy numbers.
I would def. agree with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long has the NFL been in existence?
It has been around since 1920.
Who were the first teams?
There were two and their names were the Decatur Staleys and the Chicago Cardinals.
Are those teams still around today?
Yes, but with different names. Their names today are the Chicago Bears and the Arizona Cardinals.
Have there been other football leagues besides the NFL?
Yes, but the NFL is considered the most competitive.
Who is considered the most famous quarterback of all time in the NFL?
I am not sure, but my vote would go to Fran Tarkenton.
I think Joe Montana would be first on the list.
No way. He might come in behind Peyton Manning.
Who did the quarterback, John Elway, play for?
He played for two teams, but he became famous with the Denver Broncos.
How many players are on an NFL team?
There are 53 players on an NFL team.
What is the average salary of an NFL player?
A new rookie can currently expect to make around 365,000 per year.
How long does the average player stay with the NFL?
The average career time of an NFL player is  about 3.3 years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the worst team in the NFL?
Without a doubt it must be the Cleveland Browns
That's what I was thinking also
They haven't done anything noticeable in years
I remember some seasons where they didn't even win a single game
Just terrible
It must be hard to be a cleveland fan
I know a few, thankfully they have one of the best basketball teams in the NBA
Yeah that must make them feel a little better
I think the jaguars are a close second worse
Yeah I totally agree, they've been about as good as the browns
They are starting to show promise though
Their quarterback is starting to do good
Blake Bortles has a lot of potential
I think that team will improve over the next few years
Yeah but not superbowl material
Hey but you never know, anything could happen
Those two teams are definitely not winning that anytime soon
I have to agree with that for the most part
But I still like to cheer for the underdog
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man every year when the Superbowl ends I get depressed, no NFL football for months
I know, I like MLB and NBA but I still spend most time reading about off season NFL Moves
Who do you think did the best in the draft this year?
I don't know I like Houston picking up DeSean Watson from Clemson and the Browns added a lot of depth too
You planning on going to any games this year?
No I have kids so NFL Sunday ticket at home for me.  Do you get it with your cable package?
Yes I do, I have the NFL channel on all year, annoys the heck out of my wife, LOL
Yeah I watch quite a bit too.  Have you ever been to NFL hall of fame in Canton?
No I havent but I'm dying to go one day.  Favorite team of all time?
Of course the 85 Bears best defense and best coach of all time.
Yeah Maybe maybe, but the Pats under Brady and Belichek are sure giving them a run for their money, maybe surpassed them.
I guess thats true, I just remember watching that Bears team as a kid and it seemed like they could beat anybody
You think any team will pick up Kaepernick?
Probably not.  Sucks for him cause it seems like he still has some good talent but he sorta ruined it for himself with the protest thing
Do you play NFL Madden?
I used to quite a bit, but since I have kids now its a lot tougher but I miss it.  I grew up playing Tecmo Bowl for NES
Do you like the new NFL uniforms?  If you watch classic films they look so modern compared to those old bulky shirts they used to wear
Yeah everything seems so aerodynamic to maximize performance
Okay last question, you go to a game with your buddies, whats the ultimate tailgate meal?
Hmmm great question I'd say cold beer, and brats right off of the grill
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for some football?
HAHA. I got that reference.
Yeah going back to the good old days of football.
Yes, the days that we had John Madden to talk about cankles.
Are you going to be cheering for the Bears this year?
Yes, especially now that they got rid of Jay Cutler.
I know it is about time that they got rid of that dead weight.
He just needed to know when to throw the ball away.
Exactly, that made it so he got picked off way too often and his arm went from an asset to a liability.
He did have a great arm which we could see in some flashes of greatness, but that is all they were flashes.
Yes, and his personality was horrible for the team, fans, and the media.
I know that is why you got the smoking Jay Cutler meme.
I also liked when Martellis Bennett Trashed him on the ESPN interview last year.
That was great, but he not only trashed Jay, but the whole organization.
And it really showed that the whole organization needs a shake up.
I agree starting from the top lets get some new owners in there.
Ownership and do great things for an organization look at the ricketts and the Cubs. Great turn around.
Yes, they should buy the Bears as well and get the McCasky's out of their. They do not care and just know they are going to make money if they win or lose.
You are right I guess this is going to be another year where I probably do not watch football because Da Bears will suck.
You and me both brother. it will be another disappointing year in Chicago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the NFL player complaining about the NFL salaries?
No, what was he complaining about?
He's complaining that NBA stars make more money than NFL stars.
Well, that's like apples and oranges, it's two different things.
True, and the pay structure is different, but it's not like these guys get paid peanuts.
I know what you mean. Actors and athletes make way too much money.
This former player, Terrance Knighton, was complaining because some NBA stars had some big contract signings recently.
Who were the NBA stars?
James Harden from the Houston Rockets signed a contract for 228 million for the next six years.
Wow, that is a LOT of money for playing with a ball.
Yeah, I know, it's crazy. Steph Curry from the Golden State Warriors signed a 5 year contract for 201 million.
So what was Knighton's point about?
He was arguing Aaron Rogers is a more valuable athlete, and should earn more than Harden.
How much does Rogers make?
He's in the middle of a 5 year contract for 110 million.
That's not exactly peanuts.
He also argued Tom Brady should make more than Steph Curry.
I thought Brady was very well paid?
He's on a two year contract for 41 million.
Well that's the same as Curry then. They should all just be grateful they get paid as well as they do for playing a game for a living.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you stoked for the next NFL season!
Yeah dude! Who you think will do good?
I'm feeling the Bucs
Why them?
Man Jamis Winston is freakin up and coming.
True and that O-line though
That and they are surrounding him with talent.
How's the defense?
They are ok I guess but nothing special
Huh that's true
Who you think will break out?
I think Cam and the Panthers are coming back
Why you say that?
Cam was injured a nice chunk of last year
That's true
And they have some good talent around him.
What you think of the Browns?
Man you kidding right?
Yeah everyone knows they'll be terrible
Got that right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Marshawn Lynch is coming back.
Really, I thought he was done for good.
Yeah, I thought he was done too.
He is over 30 years old.
Usually, running backs decline by that age.
What team is he on?
He plays for the Raiders now.
That should be fun to watch.
Yeah, he's from there.
The Raiders made the playoffs last year.
They lost in the first game though.
Their QB Carr got hurt before the game.
Yeah, that was a tough break.
Lynch should take some pressure of Carr.
A good running game is essential.
It keeps the defense guessing.
A running and good passing game should help the raiders.
They also have a good defense.
Khalil Mack was an All-Pro last year.
He's a great player.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the quarterback option is an outdated move in today's NFL?
Yeah, I think the defenses in the league have learned how to defend against.
I kind of disagree. I think it still have its merits.
How so?
I think that quarterbacks with good pocket presence will still be able to use the move to stall defenses.
So only good quarterbacks can use it?
Yeah, I think quarterbacks who can stay in the pocket longer can benefit from it.
What about running quarterbacks?
I don't think they'll be able to manage it. Like you said, defenses are just too fast these days.
I agree. I think quarterbacks who use it to run themselves are going to get buried.
But like I said, good passing quarterbacks can use it to stall defenses.
Which quarterbacks do you think can use it?
Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, etc. those kinds of quarterbacks.
It's so odd how that move became so outdated.
Yeah, I think defenses were just so new to it that they didn't know how to respond.
That's why the NFL is the top of the class when it comes to studying film.
I hope more elite quarterbacks use it though. It's entertaining.
I agree.
I definitely think that a good offensive line helps as well.
Definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think ends up with the worst record this year
Has to be the Browns
No way not again
Could be the Jaguars
I think they have a shot at the division
OK maybe the Bears?
Yeah they have a huge problem at quarterback
I dont like Trubisky at all
Add in that they traded future picks away to move up one spot and thats a recipe for failure.
Yeah I think they are going to go flat this year.
They havent been good in awhile
Yeah that too
Did Cutler sign anywhere
Nope still a free agent
And so is Kapernick right
Yeah
Amazing that Glennon got starter money
And Osweiler is still under contract for starter money
He has been a huge bust
He wasnt that great at Arizona State either
XXXXXXXXXXX
NFL football is pretty unique compared to the sports in the rest of the world, isn't it?
Yes. It has a unique history.
How did America's version of football become what it is today, do you know?
It basically was derived from English sports like Rugby and Soccer.
Why do they call it football in America, when football is actually a completely different game everywhere else?
It's because, when the game was invented, most games at that time were played on horseback, such as Polo. Since it was played on foot they called it football.
Is that the same reason Europeans call soccer football?
Yes, but we call their football soccer to differentiate from our own game played on foot, which we call football.
But it still causes confusion. Do you know any other interesting facts?
The Superbowl is the most watched television event in America.
That's not surprising.
Another interesting fact is that 78% of NFL players go bankrupt within 2 years of retiring from the league.
That's a higher number than I would have guessed.
A little known fact is that the cheerleaders don't make money. They only get a few dollars a game, and they spend more money on hair and makeup than they get paid, so they actually lose money.
That's a real shame. The cheerleaders are the main thing some people enjoy about the game.
The NFL doesn't make as much money as you might guess.
How much do they make?
Well, they pull in 9 billion in total revenue, but the entire profit of the NFL is only 1 billion.
Compared to other types of entertainment that's very unimpressive.
Yes, it is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You think the Falcons will be really good again this year?
I don't know, they still have all the same pieces right?
Oh yeah, Julio Jones and company will be back.
I just feel like they peaked last year, and they won't be able to duplicate that success.
Yeah, I think Matt Ryan led the NFL in fantasy points right?
Is that what we're using to determine how good players are these days?
Well I know it sounds stupid, but fantasy points does kind of sum up a players performance.
Yeah i guess you're right.
I hear ya though, it's tough to repeat a stellar performance like last year.
Honestly I was just surprised they were good all year.
What do you mean?
I just thought that Freeman would get hurt or something, he's so small.
Yeah he is.  I mean Julio cooled off there at the end though.
Yeah that's true, he cooled off but they were still really good.
I think he was on pace to break all kinds of records.
Yeah, he had that one game where he got over 300 receiving yards.
Yeah that was insane, that's so many yards.
At some point, I feel like that's a bad thing though.
Why's that?
Wouldn't you be a little jealous and annoyed if your qb threw to one guy that much, and not you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, so I don't really understand this football stuff at all.
What don't you understand?
Well, I want to be able to enjoy NFL games when we watch them. But I don't get the basic rules.
Like, about what down it is?
Yeah. What's a down?
Oh wow. Okay. Back to basics then.
So what is it?
A down is like a play. If you play four times without getting 10 yards forward, the other team gets the ball.
Okay. That makes sense.
And it resets if you move forward 10 or more yards.
I can understand that.
Anything else?
How do you win?
You score the most points.
How do you score points?
Well, you either get a touchdown, or through a kick.
Which is worth more?
A touchdown.
I guess I've got a lot to figure out.
I bet the NFL sells a rulebook!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I see you're wearing an Arizona Cardinals shirt.  You ready for the season?
I cannot wait!
You think it's going to be Fitzgerald's last year?
I don't know. He seems to be super-human he may last forever. What do you think?
Nobody's super-human. He's getting up there in age.  This may be it for him.
If so, he will be missed. He's so fun to watch.
I know. right?  How great was that Superbowl game?
Such a heartbreaking ending.  We should have won it.
Maybe this will be their year?
That would be awesome, but there are some great teams.  I guess we'll wait and see.
Yeah I hope our defense can step it up.
Nobody's better that Patrick Peterson.
It's awesome to watch him guarding a receiver.  He's on them like glue!
I know!  The QB sometimes just ignores that receiver and throws to someone else.
That makes it tough for the offence to pretty much lose a player for the game.
Yep!  I just hope nobody gets hurt!
That seems to be how the Cardinals roll.
It is.  I tell you we could have won it all 2 years ago if we didn't have all of our defense on injured reserve.
I agree.  Here's hoping we don't have that problem this year.
Fingers crossed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, isn't the preseason coming up?
I guess, if you want to watch third stringers.
I'm feeling good about this year.
At least they don't have to play the AFC West.
They are kind of rough.
Is that quarterback healthy? I heard some stuff.
You can't trust the Internet.
Nobody gets the paper anymore.
They will be ok.
I suppose, but they don't get past the first round.
Hey, in it is in it. They have to get a break sometime.
I hope you're right.
You going to watch it at BW's?
Probably not, it is just too noisy there. Just hang at the house.
Maybe I will come by, man.
Bring the beer this time, fool.
I think they open on the road.
Maybe.
Gosh, is it even on TV? I didn't check.
It usually is if it isn't blacked out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What were the best touchdown dances you have ever seen in NFL history?
Wow, that's a good question. I'm guessing I would have to go back a few years because players can't get too crazy anymore.
Nope. They can't. Chad Johnson really made the NFL crackdown on the extremity of the dances.
Remember the Joe Horn cell phone touchdown celebration?
Yes, that was a Sunday night game, right?
Yes it was. The Saints were atrocious at that time. I believe that was 2003.
That was a ridiculous celebration. Probably one of the most absurd ones I have ever seen.
Absolutely absurd. Another one from the Saints, remember the Leap Frog dance.
That was sometime in the 1990's, right?
I believe it was the early 1990's. I think the Saints were so bad that they even screwed up that celebration.
Wouldn't surprise me. Remember the Chad Johnson golfing celebration?
I do remember that. He got fined for that.
Guess the commissioner didn't like using the pile-on as a prop.
Certainly not. Seems like the wide receivers were always the entertainment divas.
Absolutely. Terrell Owens. He was the diva that got everything started.
His touchdown celebration on the star in Dallas is when things started to accelerate with the celebration stuff.
Seems like it was around that time. Remember his pom-pom cheerleader celebration.
Yes, I definitely remember that. His sharpie autograph celebration was great also.
That guy was definitely a diva.
Chad Johnson definitely followed in his foot steps.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey
What's good
Eh just chilling with a beer
Sounds fun
What bout you
Watching some pre season on NFL
Sounds tight
It is
How's the season looking
It's looking good
You say?
Most definitely is for our boys
Well shoot
What?
I am excited for it
Same bro
It's gonna be a exciting season
For sure
Gotta get tickets too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite football team?
In college or the NFL?
In the NFL.
Oh, the Denver Broncos.
Really?  Why?  You're from South Carolina.
When I was little, I had an aunt who lived in Colorado and she sent me a Broncos shirt as a birthday present.  I didn't know it was a football team but I liked the little horsie.
Really?  That's why you like the team?  Because of a shirt when you were little?
It's true.
You fell for the marketing.
I did.  But, that's why team merchandising is so important.
So, what's your second-favorite team?
Are you kidding?  There's no such thing as a second-favorite team!
But what it if the Broncos are terrible?  Who do you support then?
The Broncos!  They've been terrible before and probably will be again at some point.
The Patriots have never been terrible.
Is this a joke?  Prior to Tom Brady, the Patriots were awful for virtually all of their entire existence.
Really?  I had no idea.  I'm super young.
Obviously.
So who do you support in the Super Bowl if the Broncos aren't in it?
Whichever team I hate the least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you psyched about this coming NFL season?
Oh yeah. Can't wait to see my team in action.
What team is that?
The Bills.
No offense, but I don't see them doing anything this year.
Why is that?
They had 9 losses last year, and pretty much the same for the past years.
Hey nothing is impossible.
Your right. The starting quarterback; Tyrod Taylor could be replaced.
I don't think it's just a quaterback issue.
I'm just saying, he is a major component in the team and has to step up.
On that note, did you hear the Bills picked up Nathan Peterman?
Has he played on any other NFL team?
No, he was recently drafted from a Pittsburgh college.
I wander how his stats are?
From what I see, there is a close chance he can be starter quarterback for the Bills.
Which one would you want to see out on the field as starter quarterback?
I'm sticking with the veteran quarterback.
A true fan of Tyrod Taylor I see.
Yes. Until his career is over with the Bills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the upcoming NFL season?
I am an Arizona fan so I care about the NFC West.
Who won that last year?
The Seahawks won the NFC West in 2016.
How did the Cardinals do?
They under performed and did not even make the playoffs.
What was their main problem.
Surprisingly, place kicking really hurt them.
How did that happen?
They lost at least two games where field goals that should have been made would have won the game for them.
Any other problems?
The defense also did not produce as expected.
What was wrong with them.
They had one great corner and the other one was always vulnerable.
How does the upcoming season look for them?
Hopes are high  because Carson Palmer can still produce and Larry Fitzgerald was as productive as ever last season.
How about the defense?
They lost one good lineman but have shored that position up.
What about corner back?
The added some depth there and should be much better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of Jaylon Smith.
The Cowboys Football Player?
Yes
He's good, he suffered a knee injury while in NOtre Dame though.
Yea, still doing some recovering from it I hear
Yea I heard that too.
Did you know he suffers from drop foot?
No I did not know that.
He has to wear a brace.
Wow, does that affect his playing?
Not really. His contract goes till 2019.
Sohe has a few years to really improve.
Yea he does.
The Cowboys are starting him off as a middle linebacker.
Great! How do they think he will do?
They are starting him off as if he has no injuries.
I hope he doesnt re injure himself.
Yea me too.
The Cowboys are my favorite team.
Yea mine too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you doing fantasy football this season?
I'm not sure, are you running your league?
I think so, its take up time but people do like it.
Yeah, it is fun.
Do you think the Patriots are going to be on top again this season?
I don't know, Brady seems to be still on his game.
I know, I hope someone in the AFC can challenge this season they way the falcons did last season.
I know, I was really pulling for Ryan last year.
Yeah, me too.
I just don't like the Patriots but can't argue with their success.
I know but I still think they cheat some.
It is strange everything that happens in that stadium.
I know, how funny the issues that happen for opposing teams.
I know, strange isn't it.
I do think deflategate was a little ridiculous.
Yeah, me too but if you have a history of cheating, people look really closely.
This is true.
But it was a little ridiculous.
Godell is just such a clown.
I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the NFL to return?
I sure am! I think fans everywhere are ready.
I think you are right about that my friend!
I was just setting here talking to my son about the best defensive ends to ever play.
That sounds like an interesting conversation. There have been some great ones.
No doubt about it, my son feels that Julius Peppers is the best ever.
Peppers was great, but not the best ever in my opinion.
I agree with you! I told him that Lee Roy Selmon was the best to ever do it.
I remember him, he absolutely harassed quarterbacks in his prime.
He sure did! He was a six time pro bowler as well.
Who did he spend the majority of his career with?
He played his career with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
He was awesome, but still not the best.
Who do you think was the best defensive end in NFL history?
The correct answer is a man by the name of Reggie White.
I knew you would say that!  Reggie was awesome for sure.
He was the most dominant football player that I have ever seen.
Do you think he is the best Green Bay Packer of all time as well?
Absolutely! Not even Brett Favre was better!
White was great, but I am gonna stick with Selmon as the best end of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about all the recent new rules protecting quarterbacks in the NFL?
I hate them. It's changing the integrity of the game too much.
Why would you say that? All they are doing is protecting a vulnerable position player.
They're not protecting the quarterback, they're babying him and giving him an unfair advantage.
Oh come on, why would they want to give an unfair advantage to quarterbacks?
It's pretty obvious, I think.  They NFL likes high-scoring games and high-scoring quarterbacks.
So you're saying they do it to improve ratings because fans want to see games that end 38-30?
That's exactly what I'm saying. It's sad.
Ok then, how are the rules giving advantages to quarterbacks?
For one thing, a defensive lineman can no longer rush at the quarterback at full speed for fear he will get a personal foul and maybe even get fined and thrown out of the game.
But that still happens. How do these rules prevent that?
You need to see an interview with Deacon Jones. He'll set you straight.
You mean the guy who played for the Rams? Wasn't he known as a dirty player?
He was a tough player. Of course the guys on the losing end of his rough play are going to call it dirty.
Well, what does he say about all this?
He says we're molly-coddling the quarterbacks. He says they might as well skirts back there because no one is allowed to hit them any more and because of that they have free reign to do anything they want.
So what's wrong with that? Why should they get hit so hard?
Because it's part of the game and football is about intimidation and heart as much as it is about scoring. If you punish an opponent enough, they get scared and they give up.
Why not just make it about who is the better player?
Playing rough IS about who is the better overall player, because it takes into account how much drive and determination you have. If you can take a beating and keep on coming, you are a champion and THAT is what football should be about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite team is the Panthers. What's yours?
Mine is the Seahawks
Who is your favorite player? Mine is Cam Newton
Mine is Earl Thomas
Who do you think will go to the Super Bowl this year? I think it will be the Panthers and the Raiders
I think it might be the Cowboys and the Raiders
Did watch the Super Bowl last year?
Yes and i thought the Falcons played a tough game
Yea i thought they were going to pull it off. How do you like Matt Ryan?
He's a very good QB and they do have a good chance to go to the Super Bowl again this year too.
I had a bg party and a lot of people got mad that they lost. Did you do anything?
I had a party too and the same thing with the people that came to mine.
Who do you think has the best defense? I think the Cowboys have good defense
I think the Seahawks have the best defense in the NFL.
Who do you think is the best QB? i think Cam Newton is.
I would have to agree with you. He is really good
Who has the best offense? I think the Panthers do.
I think that the Falcons do.
Who do you think will be the underdog team that will surprise everyone this year? I think that it will be the Raiders
I think it will be the Chiefs
XXXXXXXXXXX
What team do you think improved the most in the offseason.
The Giants, I think the addition of Marshall opens up their offense.
It sure does, no more double teams on OBJ.
Yep and they picked up a tight end in the draft.
Yeah, but I don't like drafting tight ends in the first round.
Why? It worked for them with Jeremy Shockey.
Yeah, but he was a bit of an outlier.
But guys like him and Gronk have changed the way offenses are run.
That's accurate.
Yeah, Tight ends used to be mostly used for blocking.
Now, I can't think of a team that doesn't use their end of receiving.
Absolutely, just a whole new world.
It's amazing how much the game has changed recently.
Yeah, it used to be that the spread offense was seen as a gimmick.
Yeah, now it seems to be everywhere.
Almost as if the pro-style offense is going away.
I think it'll always be around, but it's definitely losing its influence.
I think a resurgence is possible though.
Well, they say it's all circular.
Who knows, but the spread does make for some exciting and high-scoring games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you got for the Super Bowl this year?
Has to be the Patriots again, but I think the Packers will surge this year.
Really, do you think Rodgers can win another one?
Absolutely, he's got the arm, their team got better on defense during the offseason.
I saw that, they could make a run, but not the Super Bowl.
Well, who do you have?
I think the Patriots as well, but I think the Falcons are good for the repeat.
You know that never happens, repeats of Super Bowls...
Yea, but there is a first time for everything.
You're right, the Super Bowl went into Overtime for the first time ever.
That was an incredible game!
Yea, except I was in Atlanta, and it was really depressing for the fanbase.
Fortunately you are a Dolphins fan.
Fortunately.
What do you think the Dolphins will do this year?
I say 9-10 wins, they could win the division, but they have to beat the Pats twice.
That won't happen, you can't beat the at Gillette.
You're probably right, but I think they are improved from last year, and they added new pieces.
Well for your sake, I hope you are right.
Me too, all I want for Christmas is a Dolphin playoff game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what got you into the NFL?
well, my family is a huge fan of football.
mine too! what team do they support?
they really like the juguars.
the jaguars? really?
yeah, is that bad?
not really, just uncommon.
oh, like not a lot of people like them?
exactly, there's a lot of "minority" teams in the NFL i feel like.
like which ones?
well there's too many to list, but jaguars are one of them.
well what team is your family team?
oh, they love the dolphins.
so you're from miami, i take it?
yep, the whole family is.
isn't it funny how we always support our family's teams?
not really, if i didn't i suppose they'd rip my head off.
true that, football is very important to my family.
yep, and especially the teams they like.
amen to that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't wait for the football season to get here. Summer will not be over soon enough.
I agree. Baseball is fun for a while but the season just drags on.
Yeah. In football, the season is much shorter and much more exciting
So who do you think will be the best team this year.?
Da bears!  I heard mike ditka is coming out of retirement to bring the bears back to the promised land.
Hah ha. Aren't you a comedian. The bears will have to beat he packers first. And we both know that will not happen.
Not necessarily. Aaron Rodgers is getting older. And Mitch trubisky is the real deal.
Are you delirious?  Trubisky was maybe the third best quarterback in the acc last year. And how you think he can win in the NFL?
Certainly. He went to UNC. They develop smart players.
Oh?  You are not smart if you get As in fake classes.
Whatever. You know that you are scared of the bears this year.  Probably worried about the Vikings and the lions too.
You have lost your mind. The packers will dominate the NFC north
They might win a few games at lambeau because the rest of the league is not used to playing in ice.
We will win 7 of 8 at lambeau and win 5 more on the road for a 12 win season. Then it is on to the playoffs.
I will bet you that the packers will not make the playoffs this year. If they do, I will wear a Rodgers jersey for a day.
Ok what size do you wear?  I will be ordering the jersey later today
I wear an extra small. Same as the chance that mike McCarthy survives the season as the coach.
Doesn't matter who the coach is.  Go pack go!
The pack is wack. I hope they get stuck in godforsaken Green Bay.
Not listening to that nonsense. Holler at me when the bears score a touchdown this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite NFL player?
That is a hard choice! I don't really have a favorite player, but I love the Browns.
Oh, you must be a die hard fan! How are they looking for next year?
Well we have a couple of players who seem potentially promising.
Oh, who are they?
Myles Garrett, Jabrill Peppers, and David Njoku are the ones most people are talking about.
Oh, interesting. Who is the quarterback?
DeShone Kizer for now. He is actually from Ohio.
Oh, where in Ohio is he from?
He grew up in Toledo and was really good in high school.
Oh nice, I didn't know that. Where did he play in college.
He played at Notre Dame. Hopefully he will bring us victory!
I hope that he does too! I am more of a Jets fan.
Oh no! They are also a tough team to be a fan of.
Definitely, last year was really rough.
Yeah, wasn't last year really hard for them?
Very bad, we were 5-11 in 2016. But we were 6-10 is 2015 so I'm not sure what really happened.
That is rough. Who are your best players?
Christian Hackenberg and Bryce Petty are the quarterbacks for now. I'm hoping to make it to a game this year.
I'd like to go to a Browns game as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey dude
What's up?
Watching football
who's on?
Jacksonville
Thats horrible
Yeah it is
How can you watch that
nothing else on
bowles is a terrible QB
not really
yeah he is
look who he is on
that's true
put him on another team and maybe he's be better
can't be worse than cutler
i dont know how he's kept a job
money
bears were stupid
for a long time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Doesn't it seem like football just ended and the NFL is already almost back?
Yeah, but I can't wait for training camp.
Oh same, just saying it went so quickly.
Yeah, well, now it seems like the season is year-round with the draft and free agency.
It definitely has changed. Who do you like this year.
I like the Cowboys to take another step forward this year.
Yeah, if Dak and Zeke stay healthy, it's possible.
Only thing that concerns me is their aging o-line, but I still like them.
Do you think they'll miss Romo's leadership?
Not sure, honestly.
I did think it was best for him to retire.
Yeah, he shouldn't risk long-term injury.
Agreed, I look forward to seeing him as an announcer.
Well, anyone will be better than Phil Simms.
Oh for sure. He was terrible at announcing games.
Yep, I think NBS is the best to watch games.
Yeah, Collinsworth is good. I love when my Giants are on NBC.
You like the Giants!?
Yeah, what's wrong with the Giants?
Eh, I just don't like Eli Manning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the AZ Cardinals will do this season
If we can stay healthy and keep Carson upright, we should do OK as the division is pretty weak.
Yeah, the Rams are a dumpster fire and the 49'ers are pretty bad
Yup - it'll come down to Seattle as it does every year.
Crazy news about Marshawn signing / playing with the Raiders huh?
Totally, I liked the Raiders and Carr before, but now think they should take that division down
I expect the Raiders to edge out the Chiefs and Broncos - Chargers are lost
The stuff I read about Chargers and the move to LA was pretty confusing and dysfunctional
I don't know why that owner didn't do more to keep them in SD rather than play 2nd fiddle to the Rams
It's like dumb and dumber
For sure, I don't pretend to know what it's like to have that much money, but seems that they could have stayed and paid about the same as the relocation fee?
These owners are cheap billionaires that want the public to foot the bill for their stadiums.
It is pretty ridiculous and I think the way this all used to work will no longer be viable
Qualcom was a dump, but I wouldn't want to pay more taxes to build them a new stadium.
So the Chargers won 5 games last year - do you think they win less playing in SD for their final year?
Rivers will be Rivers for a few more years, and they do have a strong run game, but what are they playing for?
Yes, unlike the Raiders moving to Las Vegas, there are not a ton of Charger fans outside of SD
Right, Raider fans seem like their are everywhere - like a plague
I'm excited for the season to start and see how it unfolds
Me too, like every year, regardless of the drama - it will be a great season for most of us fans!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude did you watch the super bowl?
uhhh yeah.
It was good wasn't it?
NO
Why not?
I'm a falcons fan.
ooo sorry
it's all good.
Really?
Yeah. Wasn't expecting them to win.
Why not?
Because they're the falcons
well true
At no time did I believe that they were gonna win
I thought they had it
Then you don't know the falcons
I know football
You don't know the falcons
Guess not
Obviously you don't. I do though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best team in the NFC East this upcoming season?
The Eagles!
Are you kidding me? You have to be joking?
I'm just pulling your leg. No way the Eagles even make the playoffs this season.
I wouldn't go that far.
I would. Carson Wentz is a dud. He can not carry that team to a winning record much less the playoffs.
You may be right. He looked inconsistent last season. So who do you really think is the best in the NFC East?
Anyone paying attention knows it's the Cowboys.
The Cowboys? Really? Aren't they all rookies?
Yeah they are a young team but they have some real talent.
I did watch some of there games and have to admit they looked pretty good.
They are trending up and I only expect the team to be better this year!
I would have to agree but what about the Giants?
They are always a threat every season.
Eli Manning is getting old but their offense has the ability to win games.
Dallas really had no answer for them last season and expect more of the same this upcoming season.
Do you think Dallas can beat the Giants at all this upcoming season?
I predict that they will split the games with each team winning one a piece.
Close games?
For sure! There will be no blow outs in either of the two match-ups.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know I wasn't much of a NFL football league fan until I got in the office pool.
You're kidding! Why?
Just never had much interest in watching a bunch of guys chasing a piece of rubber people call a football.
You mean pigskin don't you? (laughs)
Whatever! I spent my Sundays making money by betting on the NFL teams.
If you didn't know or cared to know anything about the NFL, how did you know who or what team to bet on?
I had to learn the colors of the NFL uniforms.
You didn't know the NFL team colors but you bet  on them anyway?
Yes! I had a system and the system used colors.
What color is the New Orleans Saints team?
Black and Gold.
Chicago Bears?
Blue and Orange.
Green Bay Packers?
Green and Gold but everyone knows that don't they?
I guess but remember you didn't until you got in your office pool right?
Right? I didn't know none of the NFL's players or coaches either.
So how could colors help you pick NFL's team winners.
I always bet on the team who's colors were primary colors. I never bet on secondary colored uniforms.
You're kidding right? None of this true right? Well I'll be a monkey's uncle! Get outta here!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Philadelphia Eagle's coach do you like the most?
Well, we had the most success with Andy Reid so I am going to say Reid.
Something about Reid always infuriated me.
But compared to Chip Kelly he was the best.
Don't get me started about Chip.
Just about all the fans dislike Chip by now.
I think he was the worst coach in Philadelphia Eagle's history.
It started out promising, but the guy was just too stubborn in his methods.
I agree he went out and got DeMarco Murray then insisted on sweeping him out.
Every down he just never learned how to use his players.
His blind faith in his system is what killed him.
I am nostalgic for the Buddy Ryan years.
At the time he could be infuriating but it was always interesting.
He had to be the most colorful coach.
He put together some great players.
He was kind of stubborn as well though.
And had a temper.
But the players loved him.
The players would do anything for him.
He knew defense and kind of coached lopsided though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the Raiders ever win a second Super Bowl?
Yes, back in 1981
But for the 1980 season.
Yes that's right.
Who did they play that year?
The Philadelphia Eagles
Oh man, the Eagles first and only Super Bowl.
Well yes their first, but they went to another Super Bowl.
But they've never won one.
That's correct.
Man that's too bad for them.
Depends on whether or not you're an Eagles fan.
Any big players back then.
Raiders had a bunch - Ray Guy, Gene Upshaw, Art Shell
Who was Ray Guy?
Legendary punter
Oh that's right, he's in the Hall of Fame.
Yes, one of the only punters in the hall.
I remember Art Shell as well.
Yes, was their coach as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to this upcoming NFL season?
Are you kidding me, I've been counting down the days.
So have I, I feel it, the Steelers are winning it all this year.
No way, this year belongs to the Broncos, we're gonna make a comeback.
Not without a star quarterback your not.
Doesn't matter our defense will dominate.
It is a passing league now, no way you can score enough.
Well, we're just going to have to see.
My Steelers are built all around this year, we got some great talent.
Well to be honest I think the Steelers aren't going to win more than 9 next season, I just don't see it.
Get ready to be proved wrong, we're going to dominate the league.
Want to make a bet?
Yeah, I am down.
Okay 100 dollars for the team with the most wins, your Steelers versus my Broncos.
Deal, you should just pay up now.
Don't get ahead of yourself, you will regret it.
All good man, I know your nervous.
Yeah, yeah, we'll lets hope both teams do good so we get some good football too.
Of course, but I'm winning that 100 dollars.
Good luck with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yea, both of those teams will probably still be contenders, but maybe other teams will rise.
Yea, how about the Chiefs in the AFC?
I'm not sure what to think about them honestly.
Yea, they seem like they may be one of those teams built to win in the regular season.
Yea, Reid has had some playoff success in the past, but never brought superbowls.
Yea and it seems similar in Kansas City.
They keep fielding great teams, but not winning when it matters most.
Yea and now apparently they feel like they are better off without Jeremy Maclin.
Yea, well they have a balanced attack anyway. Alex Smith isn't gonna win any throwing competitions.
You're right, but the guy sure knows how to win games.
Yea, he is the epitome of what they call a game manager.
I agree! He makes good decisions, gets the ball out of his hands quickly, and finds his playmakers.
He, I think from the time he touches the ball to the time it leaves his hand, he averages the quickest release in the league.
With speedy guys like Tyreek Hill. That is a great quality to have.
Yea, just get him the ball in open space and you may go for six.
Yea, that guy really showed what he can do last year.
Yea, they do have some talent.
They have a couple of running backs that can play too.
Yea, neither are stars, but they work well together.
Yea, we will see if they have enough to get over the top this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Superbowl XXIII on demand.
Who played in that one?
Cincinnati against the San Francisco 49ers.
Where was it played?
Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami.
Who was  the Bengals' quarterback?
Boomer Esiason.
Who were the broadcasters?
Dick Enberg and Merlin Olsen.
Who scored first?
The 49ers on a field goal, 3-0 after the first quarter.
What was the halftime score?
3-3 tie.
Who played at halftime?
They did an Elvis tribute with a Solid Gold dancer.
How did the third quarter go?
Cincinnati scored 10 and the 49ers had a field goal, 13-6.
What happened in the rest of the game?
The 49ers tied, the Bengal scored a field goal, and SF won on a td,  The final score was 20-16.
Too bad for the Bengals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about all the NFL players.
I like pretty much all of them.
Andrew Luck is my favorite.
He is good.
I feel he is underated.
I do too.
He has not had a line that has protected him.
YEah they all are different.
I do have to say that they have had tons of different lines and they have done their best.
yeah they are one of the most teams who went through the most.
Hopefully their new gm will help.
I think he will do good things.
He has spent the whole summer switching things up.
Yeah he is trying hard.
I feel he will do better than the last.
He has replaced many players.
I think he will help them improve.
He is very consistent also.
I cannot wait to watch and see how good they are.
I have a feeling they are going to have a great season.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how ready are you for NFL this year?
I'm always excited to watch football!
Who will you be cheering on this year?
I'm very loyal to the Kansas City Chiefs!
The Chiefs suck. What do you think about them letting Jamaal Charles go?
They couldn't afford to keep him. He only played a few games last season.
Yeah, that knee of his is quite the liability, huh?
Haha, yeah it is. I'm glad Denver signed him though. He is a good player.
Yeah, definitely. Me too.
Who will you be cheering for this season?
I'm going for the raiders!
Oh yeah? They are moving their stadium to vegas, aren't they?
Yes, they are!
Any idea why? I thought that was pretty weird.
They had been trying to find a new stadium in the Bay Area but just didn't have any luck.
Oh wow, their current stadium is pretty old right?
Yeah, it's very old and just doesn't bring in the money it needs to.
Gotch'ya. That sucks that they have to move but, I'm sure it will be worth it!
Yeah, they scored and amazing deal for their new stadium!
That's great for their team!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch Super Bowl VI?
No way, I'm way too young
But did you ever catch it on an old NFL Films tape
No, who played in it?
The Cowboys and Dolphins
Who won that one?
The Cowboys, big time.
Was that the start of the Cowboys' dominance?
Somewhat, it was their first bowl win.
Who was their coach back then?
Tom Landry
Oh yeah, I've heard things about him. Mostly good.
Yeah, he always wore a suit and hat on the sidelines.
Yeah, didn't he coach a long time?
Yes he did, but kind of had a bad ending.
That's too bad.
Yeah, Roger Staubach was the QB of the Boys back then.
Oh yeah, the Navy guy.
Yeah that's him
I heard he was a good playere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the saints will bounce back this year?
It's always possible with drew breese at quarterback.
Yes,he's still a top quarterback.
Yes he is.
Maybe the addition of Adrian Peterson will help him too.
If he has anything left.
I think staying healthy is a question mark for him too.
To many knee injuries.
Yes,and a lot of carries under his belt too.
That's for sure.
They addressed the defense somewhat.
They missed out on Reuben Foster though.
Good move by the 49ers to move up and grab him.
That was a very good move.
They should score a lot as usual with breese at qb and Sean Peyton still the head coach.
The NFC south should be competitive.
I agree.
The saints need to get that home field advantage back.
Yes,they need that dome dominance again.
Yes they do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Free Agency this season has been making many players rich.
Quarterbacks are getting paid.
Lions are going to have to lock up Stafford and give him the richest contract sooner or later.
Carr just got his money, so you know he will get his.
Stafford will get his, but does he deserve it?
He has had some awesome seasons, but the Lions are going to have to overpay for him.
He will get a record breaking deal, then that will be broken by someone else next year.
Rodgers will command a lot more money after seeing Carr get what he got, then Stafford, and you know Cousins is about to get paid.
Some of these contracts are crazy.
Amazing how much they are getting but is what it is.
As a fan I don't mind what they get paid, but it hurts my pockets when I try to go to games.
That is in an issue. Nothing like having to spend 500 dollars to take the family.
One of the reasons I stay home and watch is because it's unaffordable most of the time.
Regardless still love the game.
It does help with Fantasy football as well.
That is what seperates the NFL and most leagues.
16 games, so every game matters in NFL and in Fantasy.
Uh-huh as nothing like trying to follow a 162 game season in MLB.
I guess there is one last thing to say. Are you ready for some football!?!?!
A Monday Night party! Season is just about here and can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, how do you think your Patriots are going to do this year?
Looking good. Brady is coming off one of the best years of his career and now we have Cooks!
Cooks does look like a great addition and adds something to the team. Who do you think will win it all?
I think the Pats are favourites but I have a feeling that the Raiders are going to challenge them in the AFC this year.
With Lynch, Carr and Cooper they arguably might have the best triple player offence in the league.
Brown, Bell and Roethlisburger from the Steelers might argue that!
Yeah thats a good tandom too! Some teams are loaded on offense.
Other aren't, like the Browns!
A Texans reject likely at QB in Osweiler, they look like they're going to have another rough year.
Pryor looked good last season, especially as he used to be a QB and not a WR.
Not good enough that he can win with Brock Osweiler throwing too him though!
With Osweiler gone from the Texans, how do you think Deshawn Watson will fair?
I think he will be difficult to face. Operating that duel threat of the pass and him running. He could be the next Wilson.
I don't think he will be anywhere near the level of Wilson.
Maybe not but he adds an extra dimension to the Texans and gives JJ Watt a better chance of a ring!
Man, JJ Watt is a monster. Think he gets the most sacks this year?
If he can stay healthy without a doubt.
He does struggle to stay fit.
You could say the same about Gronkowski!
Just wait till he lifts the Lombardi Trophy again this year! Just you wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Football is going to be on soon!
Yeah, September maybe.
I think they open against Cleveland.
Sounds like an easy win.
You think so? They just got that new quarterback.
It is still Cleveland, though.
I hope they have a good season.
They have been doing a lot better.
Yeah, I mean they beat Dallas on the road.
Dallas had a good year.
Old Steven A. had to put on a Dallas jersey on his show!
Right! That was hilarious.
That Dak Prescott is pretty good.
Hard to say yet; give him some time.
He sure pushed Philly around.
So does everybody!
No really, they have a good team.
With that offensive line, they should.
It's just like the Jerry Jones days.
You mean when they stole nine players from Minnesota for Herschel Walher? Can't do that again!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ready for the NFL season to start?
Not really, I am not that into football to be honest.
Why?
Because everything about it just seems overrated. Kind of like Soccor.
How do you figure?
Well the season is 16 weeks unless you make the playoffs correct?
17 weeks, with 16 games. Teams get 1 week off during the season.
Ok. Even worse. In that time, they play a total of 16 games? 1 game a week.
Yes, and then they practice the rest of the week.
And during a game they stand around while the clock is running, so in all they play like 20 minutes a game.
There is a strategy to when the clock is running, and how the team is going to handle it.
Ok, sure. But in the NHL 20 minutes is actual game play. The clock stops when the teams are not playing
The NHL and NFL are completely different. The NFL is harder hits and scrums.
Oh please! Players in the NHL are routinely going to the dressing room for stitches during the game.
Try lining up against a 250 pound guy and keeping him away from your quarterback.
How about trying to pass the puck when the other team is planting you into the glass.
That is why they practice daily though. So they can try and figure out every play the other team will use.
NHL usually plays 2 to 3 games a week. Try remembering which city you are in.
Guy, Football is a great sport with lots of excitement.
I am just saying that NHL is better. Football is too slow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch much NFL live?
No, typically I watch on my 60 inch 4k TV at home.
Sweet - do you notice that NFL broadcasts typically show an above field view?
Yeah, it's kind of like a video game - like Madden on Playstation.
Exactly.  I noticed it while watching the Atlanta Falcons play.
Are you a Falcons fan - me too!
Yeah, I used to be a season ticket holder when I lived in Atlanta for 10 years.
Great stadium, and great team - the Falcons.
Indeed they are - too bad they lost  Super Bowl LI to the Patriots.
I know - I really thought they were going to win.
Mercedes-Benz Stadium is a great new venue for the Falcons.
Yeah, I was in Atlanta on business, and I got a tour of the facility.
I just wish the Falcons would win a Super Bowl!
Yeah, they really need to work on their rushing yardage.
I think MVP Matt Ryan is a great quarterback.
Yeah, I hope that he stays with the Falcons.
He also got a relatively high Wonderlic score for a Quarterback.
I read that - a score of 32 is great!
Well, if you are ever interested in seeing a game in Atlanta, let me know!
Will do - go Falcons!
