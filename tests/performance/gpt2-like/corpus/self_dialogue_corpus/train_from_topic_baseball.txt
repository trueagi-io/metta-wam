Did you see the Tigers play the Rangers last night?
Yeah, too bad they lost.
What was the final score? I didn't see the end of the game.
Rangers beat the TIgers 5-3
Too bad they lost!  Don't they play the Rangers again today?
Yes, at 7:15 tonight.
I'll have to watch that game.  I think next week they play the Astros.
I think so too.  So when I was watching the game the tigers only had 2 runs.  When did they get the third?
They didn't get the third run until the 9th inning.
Too bad they didn't pull it together a little sooner. Tigers usually play pretty well, but this season isn't going so good.
I wish I knew what was holding them back.  They have some great players!
Yeah they do.  I'm a big fan of Verlander.
Oh me too!  He's a favorite but I like Cabrera better.
Wouldn't it be great if they got it together and won the world series?
Yeah it would.  When was the last time they held that title?
I think it was back in 1984.
Wow!  That long ago huh?  I think they've held the World Series title only 4 times.
I think they could do it again.  It wasn't that long ago that it looked like a good possibility that they would go far again.
Well, if they are going to get any title, they need to bring a stronger game.
I agree!

The best hotdog ever.
Always.
By the end of the day, the one at the bottom of the pile have been simmering all day
Yep. That's what make them so good
Yellow mustard, please
Same here. I need some onions.
Here.
This is where it's at. A day at a ball park. Watching the game. Hanging with your friends, family, loved one. hated ones. Hey if you love baseball, even though I hate you, I will sit and eat a hotdog with you, y'know what I mean?
Haha. You're an idiot. I wouldn't want to share this with someone I hate. Let's say ISIS, would you eat a hotdog with an ISIS member?
Um They're Muslims. They don't eat pork.
Right, bad example... Ok,. That parking maid handing out tickets. Would you eat this hotdog with her?
I most certainly would. Hell I'll even buy one for her.
You say that now, but we'll see what you say once you see the ticket amount.
Let's get some peanuts and get back, they're starting.
Here we go, the bottom of the 7th. We got this game in the bag
We're behind by 3 points
I know, but these guys don't start playing until the bottom of the 7th. Just you watch.
Hope you're right, I got money riding on this.
How much?
I got 100 on a vegas line. I get 150 if we win. Here we go. I'm so excited.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Pete Rose should be in the hall of fame?
I've thought about this before and decided I don't think he should.
Really, that surprises me. What are your reasons?
Well he bet on baseball while he was still playing. He knew it was wrong and did it anyway.
You really think thats a good enough reason?
I can tell by your tone that you don't agree.
You can't just ignore all the records he set and all the awards he got. He was one of the best.
But he broke the rules. Thats why they suspended him and kicked him out of the sport.
Yeah I get that part. Although he has always maintained that he never bet on games he played in and never purposely tried to lose.
So we are just suppose to take his word for it?
Okay lets say we don't believe that. don't you think he has been punished?
Well yeah but not being in the Hall of Fame is part of that punishment.
You can't just rewrite history. He did what he did and you can't just leave out his contribution to the game.
Yeah so you think we should reward him by putting him in the Hall with all the great players who did not break the rules?
I think a lot of them did. They just didn't get caught.
How do you think it should be handled?
I think you put him in there and tell the whole story. Under his statue or picture or whatever you put all the things he did for the game good and bad.
I can see your point. Just put it all in there how he was suspended and everything.
Yes otherwise it's all just a lie. He is a part of the history of baseball and leaving him out would be a lie.
Do you believe the same for the players that did steroids and got caught?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What park is the best in baseball?
Oriole Park at Camden Yards
That was so old!
Yeah but its what started the way parks are built now
I love Citizens Bank Park
I think its good and has a great skyline view but theres something its missing.
Like what?
Something that sets it apart.
They tried building a wall of ivy
Yeah but thats a random wall in the outfield
How about the sight lines?
They are perfect theres not much outfield seating
Would you rank Yankee Stadium up there?
I dont know if I will ever go to a game there
Whys that
The price of tickets are absurd
Thats new york for ya
Yeah but you want simple people to be able to watch the club
How about Wrigley Field
It will always be historic but its really small inside
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you been following baseball this year?
Yeah, I have a bit. I think the weirdest story was Madison Bumgarner on the Giants getting injured in a dirtbike accident.
Agreed, he's being paid millions of dollars to stay healthy and perform physically. Kind of an idiotic move.
Yeah, totally irresponsible, but they can't really punish him because they need him to be happy with the organization.
You think the Cubs will repeat this year?
Haha, nobody has been able to ask that question for 100 years.
Good point. I think they have as good a shot as anyone.
Yeah, the playoffs are always a toss-up, but if they get there they will be in good shape with their pitching.
I think they probably have the best rotation in the league.
Did you see that 18 inning game the other night between them and the Yankees?
No, it ended way after my bedtime. The Yankees are surprisingly good this year.
I think I actually like some of their players now that A-Rod is gone. I don't have to root against them.
They're still the Yankees.
Haha, true. Their fans can be a bit much.
You been to any games yet?
Not yet, I'll definitely see a few once the weather warms up.
Totally, I love day games in the summer. Nothing better than a sunny afternoon and baseball.
Yeah, it's one of those things that's as enjoyable as when I was a little kid.
It really never gets old. There's some magic to the ballpark.
Let me know when you plan to go, I'd love to get some sun and see some ball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like baseball?
To be honest, not really. What about you?
It's okay. I used to hate it but it's grown on me in recent years.
Oh? Do you prefer watching pro or college baseball more?
Like with most sports I generally prefer watching college.
Men or women?
Well technically women would be softball, but that's a whole different conversation. Usually men but I'll occasionally check out the women's.
What is your favorite team?
OU Sooners of course! University of Oklahoma all the way!
OSU is better... at least in basketball. So why'd you start getting into baseball?
I used to play as a kid, but one day there was literally nothing on television so I watched a little bit of a game and ended up getting really into it.
Didn't you used to play?
Kinda, but not really seriously. It was more of a forced hobby as a child.
Ah yeah. Same thing happened to me - probably why I hate it to this day.
I can see what. Did you play long?
My parents forced me to do it a couple of summers. I wasn't bad at it by any means but it just didn't click with me/my interests.
Same, but I guess there were a few good memories. Probably why I'm starting to get into it - little bit of nostalgia.
The closest I'll get to it is via the Wii and even then...
You'd rather play tennis than baseball.
Absolutely. It's great you're getting into it again, but I just don't think I'll ever be even a casual fan of baseball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard baseball is trying to speed up their games.
I heard that, too. It is about time they did something.
They made several changes recently that have helped. Like automatically throwing out pitches that hit the dirt.
That helped. And I also like that a pitcher can now go to their mouths without stepping off the mound.
The next proposal is to allow an intentional walk without having to throw 4 pitches. I wish they would do that.
No way! They should have to throw the pitches. What if one is a wild pitch?
Wild pitch? That never happens. It would help speed up the game. They should do it.
I still disagree. What baseball should do is prevent batters from getting out of the batter's box between pitches.
I can go along with that. It is just a waste of time and does not help the batter.
I bet that would shave about 20 minutes off each game.
Right. So far, the changes have not amount to a lot of time saving.
Here is another time saver. The catcher can only talk to the pitcher once an inning.
Again, I must agree. Most times the catcher goes out is to confer about the signs, which they should have already gotten straight.
Yeah, professional baseball players should have learned to get their signals straight without having to visit the mound.
Great we have sped the game up! I really hope they continue limiting reviews, or we will end up with 5 hour games!
Right, like in football games where it seems like every play has be reviewed.
I hate that. It really makes watching football painful.
Overall, I give baseball a better grade than the other sports on review.
I agree. Basketball is getting as bad as football.
Baseball is still the best professional sport.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you know what I like? Baseball!
Fooseball?
No! Baseball. You know, Saturday afternoons, hot dogs, programs, all that crap.
I find it boring. Why do the pitchers always spit?
I think they're trying to intimidate the batter. You missed a great Twins game last night.
There are no great Twins games so I doubt it. Did Baby Jesus finally get a hit?
Mauer stuck out. But the pitcher, whatshisname, only threw a 14 hitter game.
Say, that is good for a Twins pitcher. Did anyone get on base?
Dozier got beaned in the head and got a walk.
That's as good as a hit. Anything else exciting?
Actually, yes. A wild pitch hit T.C. Bear and decleated him. I guess he's ok but he'll never be the same bear.
Bummer. Did the Twins charge the mound?
Nope. They just laughed and pointed and spit tobaccy jiuce.
I suppose it's pointless to ask if they won?
Yes, yes it is.
What did you eat?
I wasn't very hungry. I only had a chicken burrito, a burger, two hot dogs, and 7 beers.
Who helped you out of the stadium? Or did you just roll down the steps?
I went with a buddy from worker. He wasn't drinkin'. We had a great time. I don't remember much after the 5th inning, though.
That's the best kind of Twins watching there is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite team?
I really love the Reds.
Me too! It is just a shame that they never make it far in the playoffs.
True. After trading away some key players in the past couple years, I wonder if they will recover.
Not sure, but the Houston Astros look red hot recently.
Jose Altuve has an unbelievable batting average.
He is also a solid infielder!
Yes. Did you see the Astros beat the Yankees on Derek Jeter celebration night?
No. But that is sad. Derek Jeter is a terrific player.
Yeah a real class act. The Yankees have gone downhill since his retirement in 2014.
That's okay with me. I was getting tired of watching them win all the time.
You know who I've been really impressed by? The Cleveland Indians.
Why do you say that?
They made a huge run in the post-season last year. And their roster is not nearly as deep as some of the other teams.
True. I heard they really play as a team. Cleveland must really be excited that their team was a contender for a world series title.
Maybe they will make a run for it again this year. Especially if Francisco Lindor stays hot.
Lindor is from Puerto Rico. I saw the Astros play the Marlins in an international game in Puerto Rico last night.
That's awesome! I did not know they did that.
I guess it was some sort of special occasion. But cool to learn about Puerto Rican baseball history.
I bet there is a rich history there. Yadier Molina for the Cardinals is also from Puerto Rico. Lots of great players are. Probably because of the nice weather!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You going to the Yankees game?
I am not sure yet i do not think they are doing to well this season.
I think their last game was good they won.
How much had they won by in the last game?
They narrowly won it was about 4 points it was pretty tense.
I bet it sounds tense. Have they got any new players recently?
They actually have gotten quite a few new players i think they are gonna go far.
I love them so  i hope they go far this season
Yeah last season was so bad it was not that good.
I hope they got a new pitcher the last guy was awful.
I think their batter was worse he could not hit anything.
Definitely it is like he is nearly blind or something.
And do not get me started on the players they had in the outfield.
Exactly they scrambled around like blind mice and it was sad.
I know they traded a good majority of players
Did they now? That could be interesting
It explains why they are doing better this season.
I bet the decision was made when they did awful last season.
The owner probably wanted to get rid of the bad ones.
I bet it was an embarrassment to the team as a life long fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite home run moment of all-time?
I think Mark McGwire hitting a monster homer off of Randy Johnson, when they were on Seattle and Oakland, respectively.
Don't say "respectively" in real life. That's for an academic paper. Also, the order is wrong. It should be "Oakland and Seattle, respectively," as you introduced McGwire first.
Don't be an idiot. What's your favorite?
Probably when Ken Griffey Jr. was essentially calling his shots in Boston during the home run derby.
I remember that! Wasn't he intentionally hitting home runs into the harder parts of the ball park?
Yeah, maybe he was doing that to be more fair. Or he's a prick and was showing off.
A bit of both, I'd say. He could have easily hit 50 over the pitifully-short right field walls.
I remember I was really proud of myself for calling the derby winner.
How so? Don't be pretentious, though.
My whole family said Sammy Sosa would win, and I called McGwire.
How'd you know?
Well, I remember seeing Sosa during the season and saw his home runs were more line drives, whereas Mark's were skyscrapers. Only one could tame the Big Monster.
That's what she said. Get it?
Seems like you planned that too far ahead. It wasn't very good, sorry. Least favorite home run moment?
Oh that's easy. Jeffrey Maier giving Jeter a homerun over the Orioles. They needed an idiotic, corrupt umpire to miss that call.
I remember that, it was awful. He clearly reached over.
Yours?
I'm a Phillies fan. Joe Carter's World Series walk-off was devastating.
Hahahaha, you're a Phillies fan!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Dodgers game last night?
I heard there was drama
There was a ton of it
What was it based around?
The unwritten rules of baseball
Someone hit someone?
Cody Bellinger hit a homer
So they threw at the next batter?
Yea and then Stanton got thrown at
So did the pitcher get ejected?
The pitcher and the bench coach for the Dodgers
Anyone from the other team?
It was Miami and yes Mattingly did.
What was he pissed about
That the Dodgers had a lead and were swining at 3-0 pitches
See this is what gets me mad about baseball
I agree
You should be able to do what you want when you want
I concur with you again
Until they clean that up this crap is going to coninue
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you think Pete Rose should be banned from the Hall of Fame?
No. I think his accomplishments speak for themselves. But what about his sins?
You mean like gambling on the sport he played for?
Exactly. Do you think that overshadows his accomplishments?
I personally don't, but the majority of other people do.
I dont think its right, I think he should be in.
How would you convince other people to think that way?
Ha! Thats easy. I would prove to them he deserves it.
And how would you do that?
He's an all-time MLB hits leader! How do you not put him in???
Because he disgraced the game by gambling.
Fans like you disgrace the game by disgracing his legacy!
What else has he done?
He's the all-time leader in games played, singles and outs! You cant deny his greatness.
So he's the all-time MLB leader in hits, games played, singles and outs?
Yep.
How do they even make an argument for keeping him out.
Exactly.
What about his gambling?
What about it? He didnt boost his stats or his performance so screw it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hi there.
How are you.
Doing good, you?
Same.
Do you like baseball?
Yeah I like baseball.
Cool, do you have a team?
I like the Braves.  What about you?
I'm a fan of the Angels.
Oh okay, you from out west?
Yeah, I grew up in California, but I'm moved to the east coast.
Must be tough to catch Angels games.
Yeah, but I stream some games.
Oh, like online?
Yeah I have an MLB package deal.
That sounds neat.
Yeah its pretty handy.
Sounds good.
See ya
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite food and drink for a baseball game?
At the stadium, or at home?
Both. Amuse me.
Either way, beer is the go-to.
Duh? Do you know some parks serve wine?
Yeah, I love wine, but outside in 90 degrees during a baseball game out of a plastic cup is an awful idea.
Some parks even have sushi! That's a health hazard right there.
I love the craft foods and beer at ballparks, but they have their issues. Can you imagine eating a $15 lobster mac and cheese and having someone knock it down by accident?
That's why pizza is better. Simple game, simple people, simple food.
Where I disagree is on beer.
Of course you would. How so?
Well, first off, MLB parks shouldn't allow ONE company to sponsor their beer choices. Limited options are always a bad idea.
But, no one wants a 10% double IPA while watching baseball.
Actually, I do. And, all ballparks are surrounded by breweries. Having them on tap is great for everyone.
Sure, but most baseball fans at the games are rednecks who'll never drink the hops.
That's why ballparks need to allow craft beer in cans at the stadium, instead of just on tap. Plus these breweries make pilseners, lagers, and all other redneck styles.
Best food you've ever had at a ballpark?
Done with the beer discussion? Sure...I want to watch the game with a pretzel with cheese. Pizza is too greasy, and with a hot dog you have to walk around with ketchup and mustard on it until you get back to your seats.
I like pizza.
Yeah, but then your hands are greasy. hard to cheer on the team and give out high-fives when your hands are covered in pepperoni juice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Houston Astros are smoking hot right now!
Yeah they have won 9 out of their last 10 games.
The Astros have the best record in baseball.
Yeah they are winning about 70% of their games right now.
I didn't see this coming at all. I figured they would be pretty good, but they are dominating teams
Yeah right now they are 7 1/2 games in front of the Rangers
Yeah they have won 4 straight games.
This could be a championship season for the Astros.
Wouldn't that be crazy. It seems weird that they are a legitimate title contender
Yeah it is a little weird to see them where they are right now.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves. It is still early in the season.
True. You don't want to jump the gun because there are so many games left.
True. But when I look at the American League West, I don't see anyone contesting them.
Me neither. They may coast in the division all year.
Yeah for sure, but their challenge is the Yankees
Yeah the Yankees are their competition this year. To me, they are the frontrunners in the American League
Yeah, but I hate the Yankees, I wouldn't mind the Astros getting to the World Series
Truthfully, anyone but the Yankees!
Yeah maybe the Astros can pull it off. They have to believe in themselves.
That's the key, especially for an organization that's not used to winning.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Cubs repeat this year?
They are having a tough time even staying near 500!
I know but its a long season and wait til it warms up
Joe Maddon usually gets his teams hot when they need to be
He is probably one of the best managers in baseball.
If not the best.
What about the Rangers?
What about them?
Do you think they can go far?
They do this every year.
Have strong regular seasons?
Yeah and then they fumble it come October.
At some point the breaks even out.
Yeah I just think they lack the pitching depth.
Hamels being out is going to hurt them.
Yeah and I dont trust Darvish.
Think he will get hurt?
No just dont know if he has big game moxie
Thats interesting for a take
I know but its a fact as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a baseball fan?
Yes I have been a fan since I was a young boy.
What team is your favorite baseball team?
I have always been a huge fan of the St. Louis Cardinals.
Do you have a favorite baseball player.
Yes I grew up loving Bob Gibson a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals.
Do you get to see many basebal games in person?
Living near Washington DC I get to see either the Baltimore Orioles or the Washington Nationals
Who do you thin is the greatest baseball p-layer of all time.
I would have to say babe Ruth is near the top of moist famous.
I think the baseball season is way too long.
I agree - I think it should be weekends only and maybe 6 months only.
What is the most number of games you have ever been to in a season?
My company had a season pass and I used to go to games with clients 1-2 times a month
What do you think about the whole steroids problem and what it has done to baseball
It is a real shame a game of statistics has basically been ruined - PEDs are evrywhere in the game now in my opinion.
What do you think of the Washingotns Nationals this year?
I think iof they can stay healthy they will have a shot at the playoffs again.
Did you ever play baseball?
I did as a kid I played little league for 5-6 years
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched much baseball yet this season?
No, I've been busy wrapping up the school year.  I'm looking forward to having some time now.
Can you believe that the Twins are leading the AL Central?
I saw that the other day.  How is that possible?
Last year they were so bad.  Guess that left no where to go but up.
Still, it's surprising.  Wonder how long they can hang on.
Who knows?  Nobody in that division is killing it, so they may be ok throughout the summer.
Who's in second place right now?
The Indians and the Tigers are a game back, while the White Sox and the Royals are under .500.
Crazy how the Royals have stumbled so far.  I think everyone expected them to be better.
Yeah, I guess sometimes it's hard to sustain success.
And injuries haven't helped them out much.
True.  Maybe they will get things turned around by the All-Star break and make a push in the second half.
Yeah, maybe.  But on another note, how about those Astros?
No kidding!  They have been on fire so far.  By far the best team in baseball.
It's the pitching.  They have a pretty good rotation.
Their bats aren't bad either.
It would be cool to see them in the World Series.
A Houston/Milwaukee match-up would be an advertiser's nightmare.
But baseball fans would love it!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you even watch basketball?
no, i dont.
i just started to and its pretty interesting.
whats interesting about it?
well the guys butts always look good.
i guess i might give it a watch then.
you wont be disappointed, i promise.
what time does it come on?
i know during the season, its n almost every night.
have you ever seen a live game.
yes, and their stadium is HUGE.
maybe we should go sometime.
tickets aren't that expensive.
how much do they run?
i think we paid like 10 bucks to get in.
that's not too bad.
its the food and drinks that cost the most.
we could sneak snacks in.
who is the local team around us.
the tampa bay devil rays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the baseball season so far?
It's been a little of a surprise, especially with the Cubs struggling.
Yeah, everybody and their brother already placed them in the World Series again this year.
That's true. I got tired of all the bandwagon fans last year.
I've never seen so much Cubs gear in my life as the season went on.
I preferred it when they were the loveable losers like in the past.
That's the way sports and society is now...people jump on the latest trend very quickly.
Do you think they will rebound and end up winning the division?
I hope not. I can't live through another year of all these "fariweather fans."
Hopefully, my Cardinals will beat them out this year.
How long have you liked the Cards?
I grew up in the area, so pretty much all my life.
So, I assume you have been to games before?
My dad's company had season tickets that they shared with employees, so we used to go to 8-10 games per year growing up.
It is probably the best atmosphere in baseball, even when they aren't as good.
Yeah, I plan on going later this summer when the Cubs come to town.
That should be a rowdy atmosphere.
It's going to be great. I'm going to bring my son with me for the 1st time.
That should be a great time. Let me know how it goes and if he enjoys it.
I will. Go Cards!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello.
How are you?
Doing okay.  How are you?
Not bad.  You into baseball?
Yeah you?
Yeah a little bit.
Cool.  Who is your favorite player?
Mike Trout is a great player.
Yeah that he is.
What about you?
I like Julio Teheran.
Oh from the Braves right?
Yeah that's right.
You a Braves fan?
Yeah they are the closest to me.
That's cool.
Is there a team near you?
Not really.
Okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are so many Mets players getting hurt?
Thats something I cant answer
And their pitchers are refusing treatment?
It goes against what teams should do.
I mean are the inmates running things over there?
The team needs to evaluate its training staff.
They are losing young guns too
I think they assume that its just the kinks of being young
Some of them have weird deliveries
And refuse to get MRIs
Yeah thats something they have to figure out
They have been a disappointment so far
I dont know how they have no hitting
Guys were let go that were valuable
Its true and they dont really have a clutch hitter
Why did they bring back Reyes?
Who knows hes a shell of himself
They should sign Utley. He always hits homers into that right field corner
I think his career is over too.
Yeah hes barely hitting one hundred
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see the Yankee game last night
No, did they win?
Yup, 11-7
Nice, whats their record so far?
24 and 14
Wow, they are doing much better than expected,  Who started the game?
Pineda
How'd he do
He went six, gave up four, three earned
Not bad, we'll need him to have a good year.
We'll need more than that
True, How'd Judge do?
He went one for three, no home runs
how many does he have already?
fourteen
wow! and he's still a rookie right?
Yup, he hardly played last year
Wow, this season is shaping up to be better than i thought
It is, keep your eye on them
I will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here's what I'm wondering.. why is Michael Vick been giving a second chance, when someone like Pete Rose can't get the time of day?
Well, those are two different circumstances. Rose bet on baseball knowing that was THE cardinal sin in the game and that it would likely bring on a lifetime ban if he was caught.. then he stoutly lied about it for years
Yeah, sure, but is that worse that what Vick?
Well, plus Vick DID serve a prison sentence, and, cruel as it might sound, there's no rule in football against running a dog fight operation.
Still say it's a crappy situation.
Hey, I'm not saying I endorse what he did by any means, but still... anyway let's change the subject shall we?
Yeah, that sounds good.
So, do you think Donald Brown will make a big impact for the Indianapolis Colts?
I really like him  in the colts offense.. he's like Joseph addai but with fewer miles on him..
You, switching subjects... I think it was a snub to Jamie Moyer to move him to the bull pen when he's been the best pitcher Philly has had in awhile.
I don't know, I mean, I like the guy a lot but but he hasn't been the phils best pitcher of late.
What do you mean?
Well, his era was 3rd worst in the nl when he was sent to the bullpen
I don't know, not sure you could say it's been THAT bad.
I'm sorry, but it has.  I mean, the guy at 46 just is not functioning like he did at 45.  Something about this last year...
He'll always be the best to me though.
I think the next games will be interesting to see what shakes up with the time.
Well, they've been pushing Pedro a lot.
Yeah, I know he got like what, 10 runs last time?
No, 12.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the first traded player this year?
It seems to start earlier but I really have no clue.
The trade deadline has been quiet lately.
I think more teams are filling voids in from the inside
To avoid losing their farm?
The competition level hasnt been to the point where you need to make a splash
So we could see a team just promote from within
I think thats the direction they are going in
Thats interesting
It kills the Yankees philosophy
Well they abandoned that when Steinbrenner died.
DO you think he would sit through an era like this?
No he had no patience for it thats why they havent been good for so long
Did the Orioles window of opportunity close?
It will if they cant resign Machado
What makes you think they wont
The writing is on the wall with him
That they dont like him?
No that the coach is losing the team.
I dont see that at all
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Braves play St. Louis the other day?
I started to but stopped watching after it got to 7 to 0. Did you see the final score?
No, but I saw that it was something ungodly, like 12 to nothing.
I bet you're regretting buying those tickets for you and your dad later this month.
Yeah, I actually had tickets to that blowout they just had but I'm glad I didn't.
Yeah I bet, did you get tickets for parking yet?
No, but I need to. I heard with this new stadium that it's very hard to get parking because they fill up so soon.
Yeah it does, and depending on where you park it can really suck trying to get to the stadium.
Man, the only thing worth watching now is Freeman.
Isn't he like in the top 5 in a few different categories?
Yeah he is and I think they said he's hitting at like .430 or somewhere around that.
Too bad no one else seems to be able to do anything.
It looked like things were starting to get better, especially when they were playing at home but it's just gone downhill.
Yeah you would think that with this move that there would be some motivation to play well but I guess not.
Yeah, kind of ironic that they built this new stadium to be closer to the majority of their fans and yet, they are playing so poorly. If that causes less people to show up it will be kind of funny.
Like they made that move for nothing.
Exactly!
So who are they playing when you go with your Dad?
The Nationals.
Oh good lord that's gonna suck. We're gonna get killed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
This has been an interesting season so far.
I know a lot of surprising teams doing well.
I know! I can't believe how well the Twins are doing!
They're in first place!
So many people picked them to finish last in the division.
I don't think they will be able to keep it up though.
You're probably right. I bet they fade away before August.
How about the Rockies?
They are surprising as well.
I think they might make the playoffs.
They look like they have a good team.
The NL West is always a tough division.
What's wrong with the Cubs?
I don't know. They're not looking like World Series contenders.
They have been disappointing to say the least.
They have so much talent too.
I know. I think they'll figure it out and be a contender.
Who knows? Maybe they're starting another World Series drought.
No way they go that long in between titles again.
I'm sure that's what fans were thinking in 1908 too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who is playing tonight?
It's the Dodgers and giants.
Fyi you want to go to the game?
I can't.
Why not?
I hurt my for last night running.
Did you twist your ankle?
Yeah. Do you want to cone over to watch it on tv?
Sure, we could watch the game and listen to the game on the radio.
Did you have tickets for tonight's game?
No,I thought we could drive up and buy them there.
Let's go, do you know who is pitching?
No, but the game should be really good.
Oh,I think it's para who is pitching. He is undefeated.
I know, plus they are in first place.
I know ,I don't like the giants.
I feel the same.
Are you buying food there?
Yes, better bring a lot of money.
I know, the food is expensive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that the Brewers will be playing the Cubs this afternoon?
Yes, I wonder if the Cubs still have it in them!
You live in Charlotte, so how are the Charlotte Knights been doing this season?
It's been a hard season, but they have won 9 times in May.
If the Cincinnati Reds are the first team of baseball, do they play the first game of the season?
They don't and I think it was the Cardinals were the first to play this year!
I'm a big fan of the LA Dodgers.
My Dad loves them and has been a fan since they were back in Brooklyn.
Do you know anything about the Atlanta Braves?
Yeah, they were amazing in the 1980s when Dale Murphy played with them!
Do you know who is in first place in the 2017 season in MLB?
Right now it looks like the Yankees are leading with 24 wins and 14 loses.
Did you hear about  any signings in the minor league?
Yes, recently the Braves signed James Loney since Freddie Freeman injured his wrist.
It seems like every other day, the Orioles are losing players to injuries!
I know, in the past week, they lost 9 players!
I'm going to Cincinnati and want to catch a Reds game, are they still at Cinergy Field?
No, they have a great new stadium called Great American Ball Park.
Who do you think is the best baseball player?
I'd have to put my money on Mike Trout from the LA Angels!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did we see the window of opporunity close on the Cardinals?
No why would you think that?
Just losing more games now and the hitting isnt there.
Well they have alot of minor league turnover.
Yeah but its a well oiled machined.
I get it but you cant keep producing that kind of talent.
Eventually things even out, theyll be good.
Theyve been good for 20 some years, its probably time they dip.
While this could be true, I dont envision it happening.
Their minor league is so stocked its alarming.
Well thats where I think they are having issues.
What do you mean?
They arent developing guys like they used to.
I just think it takes longer. They need to move on from guys like Wainwright.
I think pitchers last longer they dont need to.
They peddled Garcia at the right time.
He hasnt done much in Atlanta.
Yeah but what they got for him hasnt paid off either.
Well that could take a while.
I dont think so, guys produce immediately nowadays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever played baseball?
I have, when I was a child.
Did you play fast pitch or some other type?
I played T-ball. Did you play T-ball as well?
Yes, I played T-ball. Were you any good?
Definitely not. I hit the ball once or twice.
Do you have any favorite baseball players?
Yes, I like Cal Ripken. He played for the Baltimore Orioles.
I like Cal Ripken as well. Have you been to Camden Yards?
No, but I have heard it is a nice stadium.
What do you like most about baseball?
The food. I love the hot dogs.
Yes, I love the food as well, particularly the nachos with cheese.
What team is your favorite?
I like the Atlanta Braves the best, especially from the early 90s.
Do you want to go and watch a baseball game sometime?
Certainly. We can go to a high school game.
That would be a lot of fun. Maybe we can go next week?
Yes, that works for me. I'm looking forward to seeing some awesome strike-outs and homeruns.
Hopefully we'll see a grand slam.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow. The benches cleared in Los Angeles last night!
I saw the video. What even happened?
A Marlins pitcher threw behind Brett Eibner, got him in the back.
Was it on purpose?
Some people think so. But noting happened that led up to it.
And the Dodgers retaliated.
Yeah, you have to be crazy to throw at Giancarlo Stanton.
I would be terrified to see him coming at me with a bat.
I actually thought some punches were going to be thrown.
I know, it got really heated really fast.
Dave Roberts and Don Mattingly were right in the middle of it.
It's always surprising to see managers in the middle of a scrum.
Chase Utley looked like a dad trying to break up a playground fight.
That was hilarious. He was having none of it.
I'm glad no one got hurt.
Me too. It really looked like it was going to get bad.
I can't believe Mattingly's explanation of it.
Yes! Being down by five is no reason to throw at a batter.
The league really needs to do something about that.
I agree. Fights are entertaining but so dangerous and juvenile.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Cliff Lee a hall of famer?
Are you asking if he's in the hall of fame or if we think he should be based on his stats? He's not in the hall of fame.
Well yeah, I mean if he's retired and doesn't come back. Is he a hall of famer in your opinion?
DId he even officially retire? Last I heard he was rehabbing but that was a couple years ago now. I'm not sure.
I looked, he did retire last February.
3.52 career ERA doesn't scream hall of famer to me but man that doesn't even seem right.
That was the crux of my argument too. When you take into account his dominance that number didn't seem right.
He had a heck of five year run, but that probably isn't enough.
He has less than 150 wins too. Not looking great. I mean how can a guy that was so good seem so average in retrospect?
He did get a ring though, so he has that going for him.
That five year run was Koufax-esque in an era where players were supermen.
Yeah that's gotta count for something. But hof is usually compiled stats and you got 300 wins as a benchmark.
I'm looking at this article that has him in the neighborhood with Whitey Ford, Lefty Gomez, and Don Sutton.
Ford has all those championships though, Sutton got his 300 wins, Gomez played in the era before fire was invented lol tough to compare.
Baseball reference has similarity scores comparable to Jered Weaver and John Lester. Would you put either of those guys in the hall?
Weaver no, Lester maybe but again, the rings. Plus the guy had cancer, that's pretty impressive.
The more I read I gotta say no and just today I thought he was a pretty sure thing.
Yeah it really looks more like hall of very good for Lee. Still a solid career, just no hall of fame.
Tend to agree, but it's still just so surprising.
You wonder what could have been if he didn't get injured.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are you going for this season?
I haven't quite decided.
Are you going for the home team?
Which of the two is my home team?
Well, you do live a little closer to Houston
It takes the same length of time to go to Arlinton or Houston
I've decided on The Astros myself
Just for that, I might just Pick the Rangers.
Well they do have good pitching.
And the Astro have very good offense.
Are you going to many games.
Yeah, I sure.
I get tickets occasional as perks.
To which games?
The Rangers.
So, you might as well root for the team you'll happen to get tickets for.
Yeah. Last years I got 3 pairs.
Are they usable on any home game?
Any game that is not sold out
Could I go with you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You see that twins game last night?
barrios is a beast.
I know.  11 Ks and only 1 walk
monster.  If he could be a reasonable starter, we could be good
yeah, we need like one more good starter and then we can make a run
I'm not sure about the offense though
still got Mauer
haha, he's washed up
no way man, he's only 33
yeah, but he has NO power
doubles still count and his OBS is great
I don't know, they need Buxton and Sano to come up and play
I like sano, he's the MAN
same, I love watching him rake
what are we going to do about buxton
what do you mean
I mean he's striking out like no tomorrow
that will take care of itself
you think so
well, only time will tell
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Yankees against the cubs the other night?
Yeah. Wow that was the longest game. I was watching until 2:30 in the morning!
I know right? Eighteen innings. It was a crazy marathon.
Its a rarity to see them play.
Yeah I think it's been 3 years since they've been face to face.
I'm glad the Yankees swept them.
Yeah I'm glad that the Cubs finally won the World Series last year!
They broke the 108  year curse! I'm happy for them too.
I'm watching Yankees vs Astros now.
It's crazy how we swept the Cubs but we are losing to the Astros.
We shouldn't  have traded McCann.
Well Sanchez is a good DH and he's a great catcher.
I dont know If Sanchez is up to par since his injury.
He just came back from the DL and he's trying to adjust. He'll be fine.
How about that Aaron Judge?
He's awesome! I think he broke the video board the other night with his hit!
Yes he did. the Yankees aren't  going to fix it either. They say it will go down in history as a static record.
Thats so funny. I'm really looking forward to seeing all the new young players.
Me too. I miss the old dynasty but I think we are going to do great with the new home grown!
I agree! Its time for another Championship! Number 28!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
how many leagues of baseball?
3
what are they?
major, minor and independent
what the major league composed of?
I think, national and american
which are famous baseball p;ayers?
bryes harper, albert pujols
who won 3 MVP awards?
Albert
which baseball player dated celebrity Kate Hudson?
alex rodriguez
which other star he dated?
I think madonna.
was he suspended?
Yes Alex was suspended for whole year.
Is he still famous?
He is very famous.
how many Jeter got "likes" on face book?
2.5 million
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the top Rookie of the Year candidates for this season?
Benintendi and I dunno.
You a Sox fan or is that just your guess?
Nah I'm a Rangers fan actually. Just think Benintendi is the front runner.
I like him, but wow, you're a Rangers fan and didn't say Gallo?
Does Gallo have eligibility? He's played small parts in three seasons.
Hmmm good point.
I just checked he had 133 ab the last 2 years and the cutoff is 130 so nah he's ineligible.
Oooh so close, that stinks.
Yeah. Even though I'm a Rangers fan and like the longball, he's not exactly doing much else at the plate either.
What about Swanson for the NL?
Yeah maybe, he's a popular pick but I can't call the National League. Thinking pitcher for some reason.
You're right there, I was thinking possibly Glasnow but no one is really head n shoulders.
Bell for the Pirates too...he's in the mix for NL ROY I'd think.
Maybe Renfroe and Margot for the Padres, but Petco might dampen their stats in comparison to others.
Those are two other good choices. NL has a lot of young talent this year.
It'll probably be some guys we've never even heard of that come up and get hot that win and we'll all be wrong lol.
LOl yea. Speaking of hot, what about Aaron Judge?
How could we forget that lol I think he's got a leg up on Benintendi at the moment.
Yeah I change my pick lol
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the baseball game?
Yes it was exciting
I thought it was a little dull
Why would you think that?
The game was very one-sided
Yes, only one team scored points
It would be more exciting if it was a closer game
I agree
Perhaps the next game will be better
I agree
Who will be playing next time?
I believe it is the team's rival
Oh I think that will be a better game
I agree!
When will that be?
I believe next week
Will you be watching it?
Yes, I will. Will you be watching it?
Yes, I will.
See you then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that MLB has an agreement with Facebook to allow Facebook to broadcast a game ever Friday, with no blackouts?
Yup I did. Not a bad deal at all. Even though you may not be able to watch your favorite team each week, it's still cool.
MLB.tv already has a free game of the day but it has blackout restrictions.
I wonder if the Facebook game will be different from the MLB one.
I'm sure it will be the same. Yahoo has a free game every day and it's always the same as the MLB's free game.
Sounds like the MLB is desperate.
Why do you say that?
Just like any sale, the MLB is trying to get people "in the door" to sample the product by giving it away for free.Most Americans have lost interest in baseball.
I doubt they're giving it away for free.
I think it is very telling that no source I can find discloses how much MLB was paid for this deal, just that it was deal.
MLB is more popular than ever. It's still America's game. The ratings are through the roof.
Do you have a source on that?
Yup, a source on Forbes.com says ratings were up 1% last year.
Were television ratings up for certain games or what?
9 clubs had number 1 rankings across all television networks and 16 out of 29 clubs ranked in the top 3 across television networks.
So are these ratings only taking into account primetime games?
Yes, the ratings are for regular season primetime games.
I guess that's pretty believable data since many fans watch throughout the summer months.
I agree and now with more free games streaming on Facebook you can expect ratings to go up even more.
That's true, I wish the NFL would do something like this. HA just kidding that'll never happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the Sox this year?
They could use a third-base man.
I know. It's the worst in the AL.
I can't believe they really thought Sandoval would be the answer.
He looked good in Spring Training.
True. He actually lost weight.
He did. Maybe he'll be OK when he's back off IR.
I think they should bring up the kid from Portland.
I think he needs at least a few months there. Maybe August.
Hopefully they're in contention come August.
Well, David Price goes tonight I think in Pawtucket.
That would be a big help. Sale can't do it alone.
True that. But he's been must see TV this spring.
The guy has struck out double-digits seven games in a row and counting.
When's his next start.
I'm not sure but I think it might be tonight as well.
Yeah. But it's a late start west coast game.
I hate those games. Oakland tonight right?
Yeah. I'm not sure how they're doing this year.
Me neither. But hey, Billy Beane always has them close it seems.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you see the dodger game last night?
yes
Bellinger is really good
i agree
they should dump gonzalez
I disagree
why
he's a good hitter
bellinger is better
yes, but he can't hit righties
I know but he's a better fielder
I agree.
do you like seager
yes, he's great
I agree, what about hernandez?
he sucks
I agree
the dodgers need a catcher
they should trade for one
yes, i agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
How are you doing?
Well and you?
Great.  Do you like baseball?
I do.
Who is your team?
I am a fan of the dodgers.
Oh cool.  I like the braves.
Nice.
Have you ever seen a game live?
I have a few times.
Me too.  Did you have a blast?  I sure did.
I did as well, really love going to the ball park.
Same here, can't wait to go back.
I hear you.
Favorite player?
Don't really have one.
Nice talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still can't get over that World Series from last year.
Cubs win! Cubs win!
Honestly, I was rooting for Cleveland.
Not me, after they already won the NBA finals there was no way I would root for that town.
It was more because I grew up a White Sox fan.
A southsider, eh?
No, I actually went to school on the north shore.
Whereabouts?
Evanston.
That's a lot different than the south side!
Yeah, but I grew up watching Ken Harrelson broadcast the Sox games on WGN.
Wimpy and Hawk! Who was your favorite player?
I always liked Frank Thomas.
The Big Hurt!
But there were a lot of good players from that era. Robin Ventura was another.
Do you remember Black Jack MacDowell?
Of course! He was probably my favorite pitcher.
Did you see the Sox when they won the world series, then?
Actually, I was out of the country at the time and I missed it.
Bummer!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Yo
What's going on.
Not much, you?
Same here.
Cool.
You like baseball?
Yeah I like baseball alright.
Yeah same here.  Do you have a team?
Yeah I like the Tigers.
Oh okay, cool.
What about you?
I like the Braves.
The Braves huh?
Yeah.  Who is your favorite player?
I don't really have a player, just like the team.
Oh okay.
What about you?
I like Julio Teheran.
Cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mike Trout is having another amazing year for the Angels.
Yeah he is hitting .341 with 13 homes and 30 RBI's
This guy is a stud. You would think the Angels would be the cream of the crop.
Yeah, but they always seem to underachieve to me.
They are already 8 games behind the Astros for the Division.
Yeah, but the Astros are playing out of their mind right now. The season is still young.
I know but we know how this is going to play out. The Angels will underachieve and miss the postseason.
yeah as much as I want to argue with you about this, you are probably right.
I hate it for Trout though because this guy is the best their is in baseball right now.
I couldn't agree with you more. This guy is on top of baseball at this moment
He can do it all for you. A perfect combination of power and speed.
The guy is a legitimate MVP candidate every year. I enjoy watching him play
I'm sure he would enjoy playing for a contender right about now.
On the positive side they are only 1/2 game out of the last wildcare spot.
That's true. They may not be able to catch the Astros, but maybe they can sneak into the postseason.
Once you get into the postseason anything can happen. Just ask the Royals.
Yeah baseball is a game that if a team gets hot at the right time they can really take off.
I would love to see Trout in the postseason.
The guy definitely deserves to play at that level.
He is a first ballott hall of famer
XXXXXXXXXXX
How 'bout those Yankees?
I was disappointed they got rained out last week.
Yeah, but they had a double header today.
Yup, won one lost one.
Did you watch the ceremony?
Yeah, retired Jeter's number!
What an honor, huh?
Yeah.  Loved watching them show all the great moments in his career.
Nothing beats the time he flung himself into the crowd to catch that ball!
Yup!  Always taking one for the team.
Nothing but total respect for him, even from the current players.
In another couple years he may be headed to Cooperstown!
No doubt!
Did you watch when they played the Cubs and they went into 18 innings??
Yeah, unbelievable!
Six hours of baseball!  What's better than that?
Right??  When are they playing the Redsox again?
Not till early June.
Those are my favorite Yankee games.
Yup--classic rivals!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the New York Yankees?
I used to as a kid, but not anymore.
What happened?
Well, they lost the World Series and I gave up on them.
Well, they won a lot more after that.
Yes, but I started to like the Phillies instead.
Yes, they are a fun team.
I like to go to see them play.
What do you like about them?
I like that the games are exciting for kids.
How so?
I like the Phillies Phanatic and so do the kids.
Yes, they are family friendly.
They also have a great new stadium.
I heard it has a lot of fun things for the family.
Yes, it does have new features that are fun for all.
That's cool.  I hope I can go there sometime.
Yes, they have had some great players through the years.
Yes, they have some new prospects as well.
I love to see the new prospects playing a great game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Derek Jeter is getting his number retired?
No I didn't. When will that happen?
Sunday night, before the game on ESPN.
That's the Yankees game, right?
Of course! Who else did he play for?
Nobody else that I know of.
That's right. Just the guys in the pinstripes
Didn't he play shortstop?
Yeah. And he won five gold gloves!
He was an all-star also, wasn't he?
Not only that, but he's a future hall-of-famer without a doubt.
This guy must have been the best Yankee to ever play.
Well, he is one of the best. The Yankees have a long list of all-time great players.
Like Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, MIickey Mantle, and Yogi Berra?
Yeah! But none of those guys got more hits than Jeter. He's the all time hits leader for the Yankees.
Wow! That's saying a lot! What about all of major league baseball?
He is sixth all time with 3,465 hits.
Oh my! Did he get more hits than Hank Aaron?
Actually, no. Aaron got 3,771 hits, which is third-most all time.
That's no suprise to me. Hank Aaron hit so many home runs in his career.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think what Madison Bumgarner did was not right?
Its a tough line to toe
Can baseball contracts restrict what you do off the field
I think only for bad behavior
One could argue what he did was bad behavior.
Yes they could do that for sure.
And how about telling players as long as we pay you, you adhere to rules and standards that would preclude you from engaging in this stuff?
Thats where you become too much like a dictator.
I would be ok with a team saying no off roading.
Yeah but some guys have hurt themselves playing basketball
Well in baseball you have to protect your own body
Right but you cant just sit there and do nothing.
I would be OK if they told people that they forfeit money if they are found to have been doing something dangerous.
That again infringes on their rights.
During the season?
At any point.
Well if you are paying them to play and they arent playing then I think they should forfeit the money
So if a guy gets hurt he shouldnt get paid
If its during a game or team activity thats workmans comp.
I see  your side now
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey pal let's talk about great and near great Yankee players over the past 30 years or so. Remember Andy Stankewitz?
Yeah he was a spark plug middle infielder who was traded just as Derek Jeter started to play.
He was a small guy that was all about hustle and was a good clutch hitter.and very good in the infield.
Yeah I remember seeing him play in a couple games he hit a home run to left field and played like a speedy machine for the games.
I saw him at Yankee fan day that winter and the fans were lined up at his booth more than anyone else. He was very friendly and autographed a picture for my young daughter which was a thrill for her.  It would have been nice if he could have made a career there.
Well, he was replaced by Jeter who turned out to be one of the greatest of all time.  Dang what an awesome guy.
Sure thing a steady consistent player who batted over .300 average with over 3,000 hits hall of fame for sure, 20 seasons.
The nice thing was that he was such a positive role model with no whining and all about his team and doing his best for the fans.
Yep, he earned the title of Captain and did a great job as Yankee Captain for years.  Others made more money but he left a legacy for all to look up to.
And don't forget that he homered for his hit number three thousand, what a player.
The man had no scandals either how unique is that in this day and age?
He was sure one of the best.  One of the greats was Don Mattingly on first.  Great hitter and team player also Captain.
He really produced for several years but sadly his back gave out and he decided to retire because he felt that he could no longer produce like he felt that the team deserved.
The saddest thing was that he led the team for at least a decade and retired just before the team went on to get back in the world series in 96.
Sure it was like Moses getting to see the promised land but not making it there for the last few steps.
Well said. Another that did well for the team but was filled with controversial issues is A Rod.  Great player, huge salary big home runs but failed to live up to his potential.
Sure he got caught up in the illegal substance scandals which will mar his legacy.
He did some class things too like when he was in the All star game early in his career playing short and Cal Ripken Jr. was in his last All Star game on third. You recall that.
I sure do he asked Ripken to switch with him as he felt that Ripken was the most awesome shortstop and should play his spot in that game.
That was a real classy move but the other scandals might delay his getting in the hall of fame for a while.  His stats were up there and could have been better had he been able to stay on the straight and narrow.

Hello.
Hi.
How are you?
Good you?
Not bad.  You like baseball?
I do like baseball.
Cool, me too.
Do you like a team in particular?
Yeah I'm a big Tigers fan.
Cool, how are they doing?
Not to bad right now.
You think they'll make a playoff run?
I don't know right now, I hope so though.
gotcha.
What about you?
I like the Indians.
Cool, shame about loosing the series.
Yeah, but can't hate on the Cubs for winning.
No, it was pretty special.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about them Cubs beating the Reds?
That was crazy! I did not see that coming.
Me either, what was the score again?
It was five to nine. I was really happy about it.
They did well, they had a good last few games.
They have, only three loses.
And  four wins! How do you think their season will go?
I think it will be great I mean they had a good margin in wins too, by points.
Most the games by two points. But they had some bad loses.
They did have a zero to five lose at the Cardinals.
The Card just really beat them bad. It was awful.They scored no innings, they were off their game .
Everyone has bad days, they only lost by three to the Brewers.
And two to the Cardinals in the second game.
The Cardinals are having a good season, so it is not like they got skunked by a bad team.
They Cardinals are doing great. I really see them in the finals.
I think they have a chance to make it to the last bout.
They may even win if they keep it up.
But, I am still hoping the Cubs pull back and take it all home.
Who do you think beside them might make it?
It is hard to say, the Cub, Cards, maybe the Yankees if they get lucky.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, why do you always root against the KC Royals.
It's only because I'm not a Royals fan. They aren't that good.
You know where you live right?
Yes I know. But since I live here doesn't mean I have to like them.
Sure... Whatever. Who is your team then?
I like the Detroit Tigers.
Oh really? They aren't that good either.
But in my case they are better than the Royals.
They play at Kaufman on the 29th of this month you down for going?
Of course. And I will wear my gear.
I think Justin Verlander is pitching.
I sure hope so . He's playing really good now. And I hear that he always plays good against the Royals. Might be an easy win.
Not if Eric Homer is playing. He's a guaranteed all star this year.
Eric is good but he isn't a Miggy (Miguel Cabrera)
I'm excited we will be able to talk trash as well as root for our teams.
I am too I haven't seen the Tigers play since I was a senior in high school.
Is Ian Kinsler back?
Yes I think he's back on the field and playing great.
Well this will be a good game. Let's go ahead and by the tickets soon.
Awesome I will look for some great deals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the padres' new line up?
yeah joey diaz isnt even good why is he first up at bat
i know right. he sucks
yeah hes gonna get striked out
i agree but the GM probably knows what hes doing
Yeah, mike martinez is a good GM
yep top of the league in what he does
that's for sure
so, you wanna hear something cool about baseball?
sure
my uncle gave me tickets to the next padres game
no way! do you have an extra one
yeah, but its either for you or my girlfriend
why would you bring her to a baseball game
because she likes baseball
but you know im a huge padre fan!
alright ill take you
alright cool
ok meet me on tuesday to catch the game
alright, got ya
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Noah Syndergaard the best pitcher in baseball?
I would say so though his command was off his last game.
Well he was hurt but hes got that big time potential.
I like Madison Bumgarner.
That guy can hit!
Hes got power and hes a power pitcher.
Yeah I like that in him.
Also Clayton kershaw
His playoff problems though are alarming.
Baseball is a team sport.
They often dont hit for him but thats just luck.
Go ask Cole Hamels about that.
Yeah the Phillies did not support him much early on.
That stinks but it wears on you.
Yeah he was happy to go to Texas.
Do you know that? I havent heard anything.
Philly has not been good lately.
I get that. I think the Nats win that division.
Not me, Harper sucks.
What? You are probably the only one to ever say that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are aluminum bats allowed in the MLB?
It's just a regulation.
But it's a stupid regulation.
It's a tradition. Besides, wooden bats make so much better sound when it hits the ball. not like aluminum bat which that high pitched metallic sound
So amateurs are allowed to use aluminum?
Yes. Amateurs at collegiate and below can use either wooden or aluminum bats. Except in high school there is one more rule
Like what?
Hollowed out metal alloy bats can return the ball at a higher speed given the same power.
And...?
They have a way to quantify that property of a hollow bat. It's called BBCOR
BB what?
BBCOR. Batted ball coefficient of restitution.
That can't be real
oh, it's real alright. There's even a formula Mathematician came up with in order to characterize the bats.
Well, what the hell is the point of that?
The point is that the wood, when it hit the ball, deforms, absorbign some of its energy, which decreases the speed at which the ball will be returned out
And the BBCOR bats don't?
Not that they don't, but it give them the way to control how fast the ball get returned after it's hit by the bat. hollow bats return the ball faster given the same power
Oh, I see, so it's a safety thing
yes,. By giving kids the aluminum bats, they can swing it, but still protect the pitchers and the infield because the speed at which the ball returns is limited by the bat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Baseball is a slow sport to me.
Relly. Why is that?
I think the innings can be so long.
Yeah. It can. But it so much fun.
What do you like about baseball?
I like going to games. I love eating popcorn.
Hot dogs and cracker jacks are my favorite. Whos your favorite player?
I like A Rod. He is a ledgend.
Ledfend? What ! I like Barry Bonds. Hes a legend.
Is he in the hall of fame?
No i dont think so. I think he's under investigation for steriods.
Really? This steriods thing in baseball is serious. You think  the coaches knew what was going on?
Probably. The players are the bread and butter for these guys.
They baseball players need to be careful with the stuff they put into their body.
Yes. They get paid plenty of money to swing and hit a ball.
It also takes a toll on their body.
Yes. Injurys are serious too.
When do they stopp playing baseball? 35-40 years old?
I think so. 35 is good. They are millionaires by then.
Yes. they can retire wealthy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, man, did you see the Yankees game last night?
Yeah, their outfielder was on Not Top 10 because he couldn't find a ball that was a homerun!
What an idiot!
Seriously, and he makes like $5 million a year.
I hate them so much. I hope next time their star player is up to bat, the pitchers of that team repeatedly hit all of their batters in the knees.
Why? Dude, that's cruel.
Once again, I'm a girl. I'm not a dude. Anyway, this way even though the pitchers will get suspended for a few games, all of the Yankees players will have to forfeit a few weeks of games as they have no one to play.
That sounds good, as everyone loves an injured Yankee. But there's one problem.
What's that?
The minor-league system.
Ooooooooooh snap. That's right. Well, if they bring up those players, they won't be as good, so they'll lose anyway.
Unless they play your Red Sox.
That was not cool, dude.
Hey, I'm not a guy either! Why are we calling each other dudes? Anyway, your Sox aren't very good this year.
They have a winning record!
Yeah, 18-16. That's like getting a solid C on an exam. No one is proud of a C.
Well, I bet Yankees fans are, since they're dumb.
True. I just hope they don't make the playoffs again this year.
That'd be great.
Know what would be even better? If one of the Yankees tries to steal second but trips and smashes his face on the base!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How bad is the slide rule in your view?
I saw Maddon is mad about it.
Yeah he thinks its killing the game.
I have a problem with guys going out of their way.
Yeah thats not baseball
But if a guy is in the path and legit taking a guy out, then thats that.
So you think a guy should be able to slide into another player?
Yeah I would not have issue with a guy taking another guy out
As long as he is in the path he was running in?
Yes.
OK i agree somewhat.
The game isnt that bad, I hate not being able to run into the catcher.
Well the problem is the whole concussion thing.
How many plays at the plate are there in the game though?
Yeah but you have to look out for your players
I think they are making an issue out of nothing
I wouldnt say out of nothing
I just dont see how its a big deal
Someone will get their spine serrated and youll feel otherwise
I do not think that will ever happen
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know a lot about baseball?
Yeah, I started off playing tee ball as a kid
Same, did you play after tee ball too?
Yeah, I played in high school and then in college!
Wow, what team did you play for?
I played for BYU, in Utah.
They are pretty good, you must be a  good player yourself!
I don't want to brag but yeah.
Would you like to play for the MLB someday?
Yeah but it seems so difficult to get drafted
But you are so talented!
Yeah, but do you even know any pros?
Yeah, I know one
Can I ask him some questions then?
Yeah, he would help you out for sure
What's his name?
Lloyd Moseby is his name
No way, he played on the Tigers!
Yeah it's the Shaker himself!
Give me his email so I can learn about getting drafted!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Game last night? 13 innings is insane! I can't believe how it ended!
Yea, that homer by Davis was awesome.
What do you think about Trumbo's hit?
I still cant belive Machado got out that early in the inning- he's better than that!
And how it was so close until the 11th inning- Tigers sure knew how to hold em.
Hey, speaking of the Tigers, they have a new owner.. guy named Ilitch. Not sure how thats going to go based on reports.
But the team stayed in the family, so thats a good thing- you know when new owners come on, its always difficult for the players.. and it affects the game.
Have you ever been to Comerica Park? I was there a couple years ago- but I prefer Camden Yards any day
Yea, I got to go for my birthday one year when the birds were in town and I was there for work.. crystal clear view of the field and pitcher. Loved it.
I'd like to get back to a game soon, but its been so difficult with work. I think between Trumbo, Davis, and Machado, it would be so much fun this season. They really are in their zone.
I know, Davis is holding the record so far with all his extra inning home runs. Guy can hit!
Right- and I can't believe what happened to Jones a few weeks ago at Fenway.. someone threw a bag of peanuts at him in the pen and called out racial slurs.
I know, sometimes fans are horrible- they get so drunk they dont think half the time. Plus, theres no real consquencs.. guy shouldve been arrested or fined for that type of behavior.. throwing stuff on the field is dangerous.
Also all that drama against the red sox was ridiculous too.. throwing balls at each other, cussing each other out.. what are they, toddlers?
I know, I hope that their managers got em straightened out so all that bs can stop and the O's can focus on the game. They are doing to well to ruin their season with crap like that.
no players needs intentional throwing, it can be detrimental to anyone. I get they were upset at Macado's slide that one game, saying he was trying to hurt the sox guy on purpose.
Well hopefully all that stuff has stopped and the Red Sox and O's will be civil in the next game against each other.
I hope to get to see the O's play Tampa in June, but depends on work.. I don't hear much about them or the Marlins, and I live in Florida! Like they just dont exist in the news realm.
I don't know much about those teams either.. I don't think they are ranked well. I've heard that they have been holding their own.
Well, the season is just starting- you know it always gets exciting! Come over to my house and watch the game this weekend, okay?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to sing?
Why?
Your going to tonight.
What?
Your and I are going to sing take me out to the ball game.
Where? The bar?
No at the baseball Game tonight.
What?
I won a contest and were going to sing.
I'm not doing it.
We get to see the game after wards.
Okay, who is playing.
Dodges and angles.
Oh, good rivals
Who's got the upper hand?
The Dodgers.
They are the best in L.A..
What time dj wet have to be there?
5 pm
Ok, see you there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about the Detroit Tigers?
Overrated. I don't see them going anywhere this year.
Are you kidding me? With the bats they have?
They are only at .500! Can't be that great...
They did have a few injuries.
Doesn't explain everything. Besides their piching stinks.
It isn't that bad. They have three aces that are pretty good.
Again, being .500 in May isn't a good sign. They aren't exactly overpowering.
They're in a tough division. They'll come around
Not with Cleveland in that division.
Tigers have dominated Cleveland this year.
Luck only. They aren't nearly as talented.
With Miggy and J.D. Martinez? They're superstars!
They still have no pitching. The bullpen is horrible.
Pitching is always streaky no matter which team you're talking about.
I don't see this group getting any better.
They'll come around. Verlander is still on top of his game. Plus he has Kate Upton to help him at home.
I'll give you that. Won't help the team much though.
I still say they will win the division.
I wouldn't bet on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey.
How are you?
Doing good, you?
Doing okay.
Do you watch a lot of baseball?
I don't get to as much as I like.
Do you have a particular team that you go for?
I like a local team near me.
Oh, like a minor league team?
Yeah.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah they are great.
Are tickets expensive?
No not at all, we go all the time.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah it's a blast and the kids love it.
Very cool.
Take it easy.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Mike. You going to ball game?
No. I watch it from the TV.
Why do you like to watch it on the TV?
Because it's a better view. I like the commercials.
Are you being sarcastic?
No, I like the shampoo commercials.
That might make sense if it was like the Superbowl or something.
Or the world series.
Wow, is it the world series right now?
No. It's not the world series.
Then why are you watching the baseball commercials?
Because I'm an aspiring commercial actor.
I'm beginning think you don't like baseball. Is that true?
No, I like baseball because of the shampoo commercials.
Dove or Pantene?
Um. Avita is my choice actually.
Red Sox or Astros?
Pantene.
Okay, you're clearly not answering the baseball questions seriously. We're done. I'm not talking to you anymore.
Fine. I will find a new cardboard box to live in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the game between the Braves and Marlins last night?
I meant to but forgot to turn it on. Did I miss anything?
Just one of the best pitched games I have ever seen!
Really.. what happened?
The Braves started Julio Teheran as starting pitcher.
He has had some rough games lately. Only pitched 3 innings last week .
Not last night.. it was a stellar performance. They played him 7 straight innings before letting him rest his arm!
Did he walk anyone?
Not only did he not walk anyone, he had a no hitter!
Are you serious? I haven't seen the Braves do that in ages!
Yeah. Teheran had an awesome night. They even clocked his fast ball at over 90 mph. And not only was he fast.. he was accurate!
I am pretty impressed. He really isn't one of my favorite Braves pitchers, but it sounds like he had an awesome night.
Yeah. a few batters got a piece of the ball, but they were fouls.
Who did they bring in for the 8th?
Jim Johnson. Poor guy had been warming up all night waiting for his chance to pitch.
How did he do?
They let him finish the game. He was pretty good, but not as good as Teheran. Johnson gave up two hits in the bottom of the ninth
Did anyone score on him?
No, he left both batters stuck on base.
Well, remind me to watch next time Teheran pitches.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever play little league baseball?
Indeed, I did. I played until I was 15 or so.
Why did you stop? Were you awful?
No, I was a great hitter. I stopped because I'd have had to be on the high school team and I hated every one of those jerk jocks.
What's your favorite memory of little league?
That's a tie of two things. First, I hit a grand slam in a field with no fences!
Why does that matter, the fences part?
Well, they can play me as deep as they want. That's one thing I hated about little league - I had dozens of homers over the years robbed because there were no fences.
Maybe if you lost weight you could have ran out the homeruns easier.
That wasn't nice...but it's true. Where was I?
The second best memory of little league?
Oh, now I don't want to tell you because you'll make another fat joke.
I won't.
Well, I played first base and was always the big kid. Once I had my foot on the bag but this kid ran through even though he was very out, and he hit my hip.
What happened?
Well, his gut hit me in the hip, and that knocked the air out of him and he was on the ground for a few minutes.
Seriously?
Yeah, I didn't even budge.
Is it because you're f..
fat? Yes. But it's funny either way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Cincinnati Reds this year?
Not sure yet.
They are really young.  I think they might be decent.
Ya, they have some growing up to do but I agree they could make a run.
They are really swinging the bats well.
Ya they have to ride the hot offense while they can.  There pitching is not very good.
That is true.
It worries me as the season goes on.
I agree, they might need to make a trade to bolster there rotation.
Or maybe they will get Homer Bailey and Anthony Descalfani back.
Yes.  That would be a major boost for the team.
If they get those two guys back there rotation becomes a lot better.
Yes it does.   They could move two current starters to the minors.
If they do that then there team would be more complete for sure.
They just have to keep hitting the ball well and get decent pitching.
I agree.   Think they can make the playoffs?
Maybe.  They might be a year or two away from that.
True, but they are definitely turning the corner.
I agree.   There manager is doing a great job.
Yes he is.  Bryan Price is proving to be a good manager.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Yankees will make it to the post-season this year?
I hope so. Last year was a huge disappointment.
Well, this year they seem to be doing better.
Yes, absolutely. The Yankees have some younger players on the roster.
Some of the new players are excellent. The Yankees appear to be doing pretty well this year, in general.
I'd be willing to bet that they'll probably make it to the post-season.
They've been leading the AL East.
I'm really happy to see that. They should be leading it all the time with the size of their payroll.
True. But there are a lot of factors involved with their performance on the field.
I don't think Joe Girardi is a very good manager, though. That's just my opinion.
I agree. He's certainly no Joe Torre.
Those were the glory days when Joe Torre was manager and they had Derek Jeter on the roster.
They just haven't reached that level since then. Not consistently, anyway.
But it does seem like they're getting their act together this year.
I sure hope it continues.
I think it will. They've taken a risk with some younger players this year, and it's paying off.
It is. Aaron Judge is amazing.
Totally! Where'd he come from?
The Yankees actually drafted him four years ago out of college in California.
He's the one to watch. I think he could be a Jeter-level superstar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite MLB team?
I'm a big fan of the Yankees.
Oh man, I don't really like them.
Why not? What team do you like?
I'm a Giants fan for sure. Does that makes us rivals?
I guess, but I don't want to be enemies just because of our teams.
Who is your favorite player?
I really like Derek Jeter back in the day.
Oh, well I mean like in general. In the MLB today.
Oh, I like Madison Bumgarner
Oh no way, he's on the Giants!
Oh he is? I guess I kind of like your team then!
Have you ever been to the Giants stadium?
Nope, have you been the the Yankee stadium?
Actually, I have. You should come visit San Francisco to see them play!
It seem pretty far. When would I go?
Maybe on opening day?
Okay, I'll try to make it there.
I'll save you a seat, we can see if we get good seats together!
Okay, I hope we can sit behind home plate!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about instant replay?
I think as long as we use human umpires, instant replay needs to keep being used in order to get the calls correct.
You want to take the human element out of it?
No, I just want calls to be correct. If a guy is safe, and is called out because the umpire was out of position, that is ridiculous.
But eventually won't that lead to all umpires being replaced by robots?
Sure, and I'm fine with that.
How could you say that?
Well, the game is still being played by humans.
But, jobs...
They aren't worthy of their jobs. They mess them up constantly.
I disagree.
Seriously? Answer me this question:
Okay.
You know how the strike zone "expands" under a lot of umpires with two strikes, or two outs, or late in the game?
Yeah.
Why should that exist? The strike zone is the strike zone. It doesn't expand or contract.
Yeah, that's true. I hate seeing balls WAY out of the zone called as strikes because of the situation.
I think the only thing human umpires should be used for is to break up fights and set things in motion.
For that, they can just use hired security.
True. No more umpires!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the deal with the Pirates this year?
Their owner is cheap and won't spend money to win
But they had such a promising core
Yeah, but they didn't put the best pieces around them
The pitching staff has been solid though
Yeah, it was supposed to be the weak point
Can they build off of that?
Not really, because the offense is so bad
Right, but you couldn't see the Marte situation coming
No, but you should have had a better backup plan than John Jaso
No team could survive a loss like Marte though.
Sure they could. Teams that commit to winning can survive
What happens to Cutch?
He'll be gone in July
You think? He's the face of the franchise
Not any more. They'll deal him for a bucket of balls
What's next?
They'll blow up the team and sell the future to fans
Haven't we been down this road before?
Over and over again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about those Yankees this year.
I know right, who would of expect them to be playing this well.
They have such a young team this year, thought this was a year to just gain some experience.
They are hitting the ball like the bronx bombers of old.
I know this Aaron Judge is a monster of a man.
Yeah, he's like 6'7" and a tank out there.
He has such a quick bat and can hit to any field.
What has surprised me is that everyone on the team has been hitting.
The pitching has also been solid tis year.
Who would of thought, they would be coming through likethey are.
They got a shot at the playoff if they can keep up this pace.
With Toronto playing like they are, starting off slow again maybe they can get some distance between them.
Yeah Toronto, has once again started off slowly, but they usually turn it around in June.
Did you catch the Jeter ceremony the other night.
Yeah, it was awesome and well deserved.
They should of gave him his statue after his last at bat.
He was truly the heart and sole of the team.
I really miss seeing him play.
I'm glad I got to see him place live in person before he retired.
Yep, me too.  Something I will tell my kids about.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey
What's going on?
Nothing much, you?
Doing okay.
You like baseball?
Yeah I do. You?
Yeah it's just okay for me.
Just okay?
Yeah, hard to watch these days.
Why's that?
I don't like all the steroid stuff.
Oh the PEDs.
Yeah.
What is it about that?
The drug use has really turned me off of baseball.
That bad.
Yeah pretty much.
Okay good talking.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you go to the game last night between the Padres and Giants?
Yeah, we had seats behind the Giants dugout.
Really?  We were just behind third base!
Oh! Then you almost got hit by that foul ball!
Too close.  That home run in the fifth inning was a monster.
They need to make that right field fence higher.
I agree.  Seems even most pitchers can hit homers over that wall.
Speaking of pitchers, why would the Padres bring someone out of retirement to pitch?
Seems that's their M.O. -- too cheap to buy good talent.
Padres should be a AAA ballclub.
Well, Padres got their new baseball field right smack in downtown San Diego.
Beautiful field it is -- ranks as one of the tops in the league now.
All they need to do now is field a team that can compete in the bigs.
Wouldn't it be great to see a World Series here?
Heck yeah!
I'd love to see the good ol' days of Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa...
Smackin' balls outta the park and roundin' the bases while fist pumpin' on steroids..
Yeah, those were the days...
Anyway, see you tomorrow at the game?
7pm against the Rockies -- see you there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like baseball?
I like playing baseball more than watching baseball.
Why don't you like watching baseball?
The games take too long and the pace of the game is too slow.
Do you think steroid use in baseball ruined the game?
It was kind of sad to see so many players getting caught using performance enhancing substances.
How important is having a good pitcher for a team?
Baseball is a team sport, so having an overall good team is more important than having a great pitcher.
Which is your favorite baseball team?
The New York Yankees are my favorite team.
Who is your favorite baseball player?
I still think Babe Ruth is probably one of the best players.
Do you think the Yankees will win the World Series this year?
I don't think they will win the World Series this year.
What position did you play when you used to play baseball.
I used to play the short stop position.
Why don't you play baseball so much?
It takes a lot of time, it requires a large baseball field, and you have to get an entire two team of players to get a game going.
Do you think baseball is getting a little bit boring?
I think watching baseball highlights are fun, but it is boring to watch an entire game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Reds are officially in a slump right now.
Yeah the Rockies ran all over them last night.
What was the final score again?
The Rockies crushed them 12-6.
Yeah Alexi Amarista had a phenomenal game last night.
Yeah he hit a 3 run homer last night.
I think he ended up with 4 RBI for the evening.
Can you believe it? The Rockies have more wins this year than any other National League team.
No I can't believe it! I did not foresee this at the beginning of the year.
I don't think anyone did.
Lisalverto Bonilla got pounded last night.
Yeah this team is in trouble they have lost 7 in a row.
They need to turn it around fast because they are in a tough division.
Yeah and they are asking Tim Adelman to be the one to stop the bleeding.
Yeah he left his last start early because of a stiff neck
They better hope that he is feeling much better tomorrow.
They need a quality start from somebody in that rotation right now.
Yeah Bonilla is the first pitcher they have had to go more than 5 innings since the losing streak started
Yeah that won't win you many games in this league
No, it will have you at the bottom of the standings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
MLB needs to shorten these games.
I watched a game the other night have 10 runs scored total and it went 4 hours.
How do you suggest they do so.
Making relief pitchers at least throw to 3 batters.
I dont think you should do that.
Well it stops the pitchers from going out and going to commercial.
I think once they come in, they have to start throwing right away.
Yeah they practice in the back and then come in and throw more pitches.
Thatll save 30 seconds per reliever.
What about the amount of time between pitches?
That too, make the batter not leave the box or its a strike.
See now we are getting somewhere.
I would also stop with the commercial breaks between innings.
Teams need that for ad revenue.
OK but you could do it during the inning during downtime.
If you are eliminating time between pitches there wont be.
Sure theres foul balls and the such.
I just dont think its feasible
Fans going to the park wont mind these rule changes
It translates more to TV In my opinion
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess what I did at the game.
What?
I hit a home run. It was so awesome.
Oh, wow, that's so great!
Jason pitched and I really slammed the ball.
And it was your first game.
Yeah. I love baseball.
I am so glad. You didn't want to be on the team at first.
That's because I thought it would be boring.
It's not, though, is it?
No way. I hit a homer. It's a great game.
I am so proud of you.
Everyone was standing up and cheering.
I get to go to the next game so I hope I get to see something like that.
Me too. I want you to see me hit a home run.
Even if it doesn't happen I'll still enjoy the game.
What if I do really badly?
I will still enjoy watching you play. I like baseball.
Is that why you wanted me to be in it?
Kind of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow the Yankees are off to a great start.
Yeah but how long can it last?
What are you kidding they could win the world series.
Oh come on ,  there pitching will never hold up.
I disagree and with that lineup the pitching doesn’t have to be great.
Now you know pitching is what wins championships.
Well pitching helps but they a great lineup, Arron Judge is turing out to be a superstar.
I know the lineup is awesome, Judge is being compared to Jeter.
He is going to be even beter than Derek Jeter.
Ha ha, he has a long way to go. He's only played less than a year so far.
It's everything about him, his attitude, his work ethic.
He is showing signs of greatness, but you can't even compare what he's done to Jeter.
It's  not just him this team has so many good upcoming kids.
Now they have Gary Sanchez coming back ,what a great 1-2 punch.
I know , Sanchez is also going to be superstar.
I still think it'll take a year or two to win the Series. Who going pitch?
It doesn't matter they have the best bullpen in baseball.
But someone has to get them into the 6th.
The  starting picthing is good enough to get into the 5th or 6th, then the bullpen takes over.
I'm still not sold, champman showing signs of slowing down. It's a long season , we'll see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Yankees are doing well this season, don't you think?
Yeah, for sure. They have one of the best records in the MLB.
How'd they get so good again all of a sudden?
Well, they have a strong roster. Especially those young guys, Gary Sanchez and Aaron Judge.
Can you believe Judge already has 13 home runs?
I guess being 6'7" gives a guy some real power.
Did you see the Yankees, Cubs game last night?
Some of it, I couldn't stay up for all 18 innings.
Neither could I. It's like a double header in one game.
Speaking of the Cubs, do you think they have a chance to repeat this year?
Well, maybe, but they sure aren't getting off to a start like they did last season.
True, and they did just get swept by the Yankees.
They're only one game above 500 right now, so not so promising a start.
They have time to figure it out though. It's a long season.
True, but even if they do, I bet they'll have a tough time getting past the Nationals.
Bryce Harper could be MVP this year.
Yeah, and they have Murphy batting right behind him.
Can't forget the pitching, the Nationals may have the best rotation in the league.
Of course you never know who might go down from injury.
True, it's such a long season, can't count on all the guys being there at the end.

Who will win these series' over the weekend (FRI-SUN) HOU/NYY, BOS/TB, TOR/SEA ?
Just the games this weekend? Houston just beat the Yankees so...
Just Fri-SUN. I have a friendly wager with my brother, just wanted to see what people think.
Short series is really a crapshoot. Let me look at the probables at least.
Just your best guesses works. Don't need to go sabermetric on it lol.
Well I'll go with the Yankees because they play well at home at least.
Yeah, and no Keuchel for Hou.
Boston seems easy, they're just better and also at home.
I'm detecting a theme here lol.
Well like i said, short series you scrape whatever advantage for a guess and they fit the bill.
Right, that's pretty much my thinking.
So you took NYY and Boston...I'll go with the Mariners for the other one.
I went with Toronto.
That one could probably go either way, home field aside.
Stroman on the hill Saturday and the homefield, I figure that's at least a chance.
I can't get a read on either of those teams so I'd just flip a coin lol.
Pretty much. I'll stick with the home theme too.
Did you not pick the Orioles series? You did all the other AL East teams.
Nah, we're both Orioles fans, of course we think we're gonna win.
Haha. You can hope. Bundy's throwing, so that's good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you're going to be on my new baseball team, right?
Yes. When are practices?
Saturdays at ten A.M.
I will definitely be there and if you want we can meet on other days to practice. My pitching is a big rusty.
That's an area I'm great in so I will help you with it.
Thanks. I want to be able to pitch really well.
You already bat well and you are a good catcher also.
Right so if I can learn to pitch I'll be a triple threat.
You will indeed.
I've never been as good at pitching, though.
You weren't bad in school.
No, but I wasn't great either.
We'll get you there.
I appreciate that. I'm sure if anyone can you can.
I helped Cam get a lot better when we used to practice.
Oh, Cam is great now. That was ouy helping him?
It was. We used to practice a lot.
Well if you can get me as good as him I'll consider you a miracle worker.
Cam plays for the Stars now.
Hopefully we don't play against them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man the Houston Astros are on fire.
Did they win again?
Yep..they won last night.
How many is that.
They have won 9 of their last twelve games.
How are they doing it?
They are getting timely hitting.
What about pitching.
They have had good pitching, and good defense.
I haven't seen them play much.
They are really winning as a team.
That is great.
I can't believe how well they are playing right now.
Can they keep it going?
Well that is the magic question.
I guess we will see.
It is just really exciting to see them playing so well.
They were pretty good last year.
At the end of last year they were pretty good.
Yeah they didn't start very good last year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever notice hour slippery a new baseball is?
No, I've never thought about it.
Last week, I was at the game and the ball boy told me they cover the baseballs with a lite coast of mud.
Really?
Yes, they cover over 500 baseballs for every game.
Why do they do this?
If they played with a fresh ball, the pitchers would not be able to pitch the way the do.
So it gives them a grip?
Yes.
I'm going tonight to see the Dodgers play the Yankees.
Awesome, if you get there early, ask around. Try to see batting practice. The players will tell you.
I will, plus it's a good give away tonight.
I read that in the paper this morning.
I know, this is the first time there are  away a dodger radio.
Did you see the game yesterday?
Yeah, I can't believe they had a team fight.
You never see that anymore.
I hear both teams for a fine.
Yup, 300,000 each team.
That's really money to pay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Minor League baseball provide as much excitement as the Major Leagues?
It depends on the type of baseball you like to watch.
I like to watch a game with a lot of real characters in it. It's great to root for a player with real personality.
I'm not sure that there are many great personalities playing in the Minor League.
But perhaps I will some rising stars?
Absolutely. There have been many Rookie of the Year winners that have come up through the Minors.
Are the tickets cheaper?
The tickets are significantly cheaper.
But then does that mean the players are paid less?
The players are paid much less than in the Majors.
Perhaps I should try out and get a contract myself.
Do you think you are good enough to play professionally?
I'm not sure. I might not be fit enough for it.
Even in the Minor Leagues you have to be physically fit.
So are there any good games coming up that we can go to?
I believe the Cyclones are playing the Renegades next week.
Will that be a good game?
It could be. The Cyclones are one of the best teams out there.
Do you think they'll beat the Renegades?
Perhaps. But then the Renegades are great too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't like it when you go to a game and there is missive playing as that batters walk up.
You don't like it?
No.
I do. I think it pumps then up.
Maybe, but the music is bad.
I agree with that.
They should have no music.
I guess it would take it back to the old days.
I wonder if the players like it.
I don't think they have a say.
Did you notice on last night's game how all the fans cheered for smiths as he came to the plate.
Yes.
That's because they had no music playing as he came up.
I did notice that the opposing team would come up to bat.
It sounds nice.
Yup, kissy good old baseball.
You going tonight.
No I have tickets for next home stand
Same here
Let's carpool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
How are you.
Good you?
Good.  You like baseball.
I do a bit.
Not a big fan?
My husband is a big Rockies fan.
Oh cool.
How about you?
Yeah big fan, I like the Braves?
Oh okay.  Got a favorite player?
I like Freedie Freeman.
The first baseman?
Yeah that's him.
Cool.
You have a favorite player?
No not really.
I see.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The cubs lost to the brewers today
What was the score?
6-3 Brewers.
Darn it. I really thought the cubs were going to go on a run
Yeah me too. The Brewers have really been playing well.
Yep. You have to give them a lot of credit for how they have been playing.
For sure. This was a big win for the Brewers. Even though it's early in the season.
Yeah. You want to show everyone that you are going to be a contender
Plus this instills confidence in the team that they can compete against the top teams.
Yeah, I don't think anyone envisioned them in 1st place at all this season
I know I didn't see that coming, but kudos to them for their performance.
Yeah they actually had to comeback in this game.
And they had to deal with a rain delayed game that can sometimes mess up your rhythm.
Absolutely. I think MLB messed up though. They should have called this game earlier.
Why do you say that?
Guys were slipping out there and making mistakes in the rain. Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Oh I see. Yeah that is dangerous and a little bit irresponsible of the league.
Yeah. Hopefully we won't see that too often going forward.
I know they want to get these games in, but you got to protect the players.
Yeah you do. You can't have people getting hurt, when it is absolutely unnecessary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did Harper not get a longer deal?
It is shocking cant see him being a Nat for too long.
I mean Trout got his deal right away.
Thats why I think hes done quicker than we think.
Can you see him signing elsewhere?
New York is probably going to run to him
I thought the Yankees were done with that stuff.
They are but for generational talents theyll line up
So the Yankees are his landing spot.
Unless washington does something
If you are him, are you signing with them?
No I would not. They dont show faith in him.
Could he demand a trade
No because that doesnt solve his contract issue.
So the ill will the Nats are showing him will cost them?
Yes in 2 ways
Which are?
They are going to have to overpay for him and they may have to trade him
Man he holds all the cards in this one
I just think he deserves a much bigger deal than the one year extensions he keeps getting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about the Red Sox scoring 10 runs in the ninth inning yesterday
who were they playing
Twins I think.
Oh yah, it was the twins, they suck.
for sure.  I think we have the Yankees next?
we need to get this this year, my boss at work is a yankee fan and he drives me nuts
I hear you, I'm sick of those clown fans.
I'm sick of oriole fans the most, they can shove it.
I know, always whining about how we play them
yeah, you hit one of their batters and they want to cry to mommy
haha, so true.  Who is pitching tonight
price I think, he hasn't been that good since we got him
yeah, what's up with that
I think his fastball is not as fast as it once was
he needs to start earning his money, bum
he will, I think we have the highest payroll in baseball
no, I think the dodgers do, but they need it
exactly, the red sox don't need all that money to beat the bums in our division
right on, I'll text you during the game when we are whooping them
dope, talk to you then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are the best starting pitchers in the league right now?
Loaded question. If you go by stats right now Ervin Santana is dominating.
Yeah must be back on the stuff.
He was always up and down with the Angels but when he gets dialed in he's tough to hit.
He'll come back down to earth.
For my money I still ride with the proven guys like Scherzer, Bumgarner, etc.
What's with Greinke?
Yeah Greinke's numbers haven't been great since moving to AZ. He's not getting lit up though.
Sabathia actually isn't terrible this year.
Not as terrible as he was, but still past his expiration date IMO. Yankees need some SP help.
Agree. Wang doesn't look good either.
Wang?
LOL Tanaka I mean. Not Wang.
They'll be in the market at the deadline most likely, need something.
Who's even available for SP's?
Won't know until some teams fall out of contention. Chatwood would be a target but Rockies are winning ballgames.
Always liked Chatwood, never got to see him come up to the Angels before he got traded.
He's one of those guys where you look at what he's done in Colorado and think maybe he'd be even better on my team.
So who else is available besides Chatwood though?
IDK I'd look at guys who are free agents at the end of the year and are on teams that might tank.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Philadelphia Phillies are a joke!
They are one of the worst teams in baseball.
I don't think I would spend 5 dollars to go watch them play
They are an awful team with a notoriously bad lineup
Their pitching sucks really bad as well. They are just a hard team to watch!
I would rather watch curling on TV then to be subjected to their play.
Right now this team and organization are an embarrassment.
I just think it is amazing how fast a team can sink back into mediocrity
Yeah it's hard to believe that there was a time when this team was amazing.
Yeah this team used to have a lot of swagger, but now they are pathetic to watch.
We are less than 40 games into the season and they are already 10 games under 500.
They have lost 8 out of their last 10 and I don't see that turning around any time soon.
I guess on the bright side they are playing .500 ball at home.
Yeah, but they struggled horribly on the road and they have played more road games to this point.
But it won't matter, this team is just not good.
Very true. It's bad when the season is already over and you just got started.
Yeah this is an organization that needs to start over from scratch.
Yeah this team won't be good for a long, long time.
But you never know, things can change fast in sports.
Maybe, but it's going to take some divine intervention to change this team around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to the Phillies versus Nationals game on Saturday?
Yes, they were rained out last night but tonight, Nick Pivetta who is a young prospect is starting the game for the Phillies.
I like the Nationals, I used to like the Phillies, but I like to cheer for a winner.
Remember when the Nationals park was named Citizens Park South because the Phillies beat up on them so much?
Things change in baseball.    The Nationals are the best team in the majors.
Bryce Harper is an amazing player but Jayson Werth used to be a Philly and I do hate him.
Mike Trout was born in Millville, NJ.  It is a shame that he was not drafted  by one of his home town teams.
Trout is amazing, I met him during a game when his Angels were playing the Yankees.  He is such a down to Earth player.
Are the Angels any good?
The Angels are okay but Mike Trout is the star who never seems to have a complete team behind him.
Did you watch the World Baseball Classic this year
I loved watching America win the gold in the challenge.  I loved Marcos stroman for being the mVP.
I loved Stromun too, I do find it annoying that he plays for the Blue Jays which is a team I hate.
I like the Texas Rangers as well and we had been eliminted by the Blue Jays two seasons in a row.
How about the CUbs?
Madden who is the manager is from the town close to mine, Hazleton.
A local guy just helped the Cubs break a long and painful curse.
The GM of the Cubs also helped the Boston Red Sox beat their curse.
Theo Epstein should be in the hall of fame already the cubs and red sox
Oh well, the Phillies just lost in the 9thi inning
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hi, what's your favorite sport?
I would have to say baseball.
I love baseball. It's really exciting.
It is I used to play recently baseball and it was so much fun.
We have the Redbirds here in Memphis, I'll go to there games sometimes
Minor leagues are just as good to watch as major leagues.
What major league team do you like?
I enjoy watching the Chicago Cubs. What about you?
The new York yankess
They have been doing good this season.
They have, I'm very happy about it
The cubs are doing okay, could be better
Have you been to a Yankees game?
No, but I really want to.
Have you been to a cubs game?
I've been to a few
Are they fun?
They are, it's so much better to watch in person
I need to get tickets
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the San Diego Padres?
Well, I'm not so sure about them.
They have a pretty young team this year.
Yes, that is why they won't do very well this season.
At least the Padres aren't in last place!
Yes, but being second to last place isn't something to be proud of.
But they do have some guys that have been banging out some homeruns.
That just isn't enough to be in the running for a playoff game anytime soon.
Now that the Chargers moved to LA who else do we have to root for?
That's a good point!
And you must admit attending a Padre's game is far more affordable than going to a Football game
Oh yes, and it is really cool how the Padres give awesome discounts to Veterans.
Are you a Veteran?
Oh yes, my family couldn't afford to attend so many Padre's games otherwise.
What do you think about the pitching line-up?
It really seems pretty hit and miss right now.
Would you agree the moral of the team is very positive this year?
Yes, the guys really seem to be developing a positive, can-do attitude as a team?
I for one plan to support our Padres, win or lose!
Me too, it's not cool to be a fair weather fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Good morning.
Hello.
How are you today?
Good and you?
Fine thanks?
Do you like baseball?
I do like baseball.
Have a favorite team?
Yeah I like the Rockies.
Oh okay.
They are my team.
Ever been to a game?
No sadly.  you?
I
Is it pricey?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Kershaw is gonna win the Cy Young again?
I would think so but you can never count out Scherzer.
I don't mind Scherzer, but it's much tougher to pitch in that park.
I agree with that but he's still putting up monster numbers.
Who do you think can come out of the National League?
I like the Nats or Dodgers to come out this year.
What about the Cubs?
I think they have a bit of a hangover from winning last year. They haven't looked good.
I agree, it all comes down to arms and they don't have any aces.
Arrieta is a shell of himself.
Yeah, I'm beginning to think more and more two years ago was a fluke.
Well he came out of nowhere and wasn't good with Baltimore.
What about the AL. Who do you think is coming out of there?
I personally like the Yankees.
That's a bit surprising but hard to dismiss their fast start.
Plus they have all the money to spend at the deadline.
I do love what Girardi is doing with a mix of young and old.
Completely agree, love Holliday mixed in with Judge and Sanchez.
Well, who do you think wins the World Series.
I have to go with the Dodgers. Give me 3 starts from Kershaw in a 7 game series and I'll take my chances.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the Mets play last night?
Yup, they did.
Nice. Who did they play?
The Dodgers.
Nice. Did they win?
Yup, they did.
Do you mind telling me the score?
Five to Two. Was closer than the score showed though.
So it was a good game?
Yea, went right down to the final at bats.
Nice. Are they playing again today?
They are, at noon I think.
Awesome, you want to watch the game somewhere?
I would, I hear they show all the ballgames at Rue's Pub
Oh, I've been there before. I saw the A's beat the Rays at that bar.
Really? I was there at that game too!
Nice. That walk-off home run was amazing right?
It was, I spilled my beer.
Ok, were going then!
Alright, game starts at seven.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to the Kansas City Royals?
Man they have really fell off of the wagon.
They went from being on top of the world, to being in the outhouse in less than 2 years.
Yeah that is a swift drop!
Their pitching has really failed them this year and they are struggling to score runs
Yeah, the good thing is that they play in a weak division
True. But when I watch this team I'm not convinced that they can be division winners.
I don't know. Maybe they can make some deals at the trading deadline.
I don't know if they are going to want to increase their current payroll.
You're right. They are a small market team who probably wants to trim that payroll
It doesn't help that Yordano Ventura died in the offseason
Yeah that really cast a black shadow on this organization.
They were really expecting him to be the future ace of their staff
Exactly. I don't know what there next move will be, but they need to do something.
If I were running that team, I would wait to see where the team is after the all-star break
Yeah that way you can make a determination which direction to go
Then your fanbase won't scream too loud if you start slashing payroll.
Yeah that's a really good point.  A lot of fans are knowledgeable about how this works.
From the penthouse to the outhouse in less than 2 years. Only in Kansas City!
Yeah, well at least they won a championship. No one can take that away!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about our fantasy baseball teams.  I have 3 teams and only one of them is doing well.  I'm getting frustrated.
Tell me about it; i have 2 teams and neither is doing well.
I can't believe the number of injuries this year!  I can hardly keep up with them!
I know; did you hear that Familia has a blood clot in his arm and may miss the rest of the season?
I did hear that.  I'm sorry for him; but i'm also sorry for me.  He's my bullpen ace in one of my leagues.
I'm sorry for him too, but i'm glad i didn't draft him.  I'm okay with my relief pitchers; my main problem is hitting.  Most of my guys, like Bradley, are off to lousy starts.
I'm in the opposite situation than you.  I have enough bats, but my pitchers seem to either be having bad years, or are getting hurt.
So what's your strategy? do you look to trade underachievers, or do you like to hold onto them?
That's one of the things that makes fantasy baseball so frustrating.  I"m afraid if i dump some of these guys, they'll turn their seasons around as soon as another fantasy team picks him up.
LOL; yes, i have the same fear.  Did you hear that Bourn went on the disabled list?
WHAT? no i didn't hear that.  that's too bad, he's on one of my teams.
me too.  he's been hurt most of the year and i drafted him real early; i need his production.
What's the matter with him this time?
I'm not sure; it's either his knees or his calves.  He's on the 10-day disabled list.
Well, i guess it could have been worse.  Hey what do you think about this Bellinger; he's going crazy with the bat for the Dodgers.
Isn't he amazing? You know i had the chance to pick him up on waivers and i passed on him and now it's too late.  someone else picked him up.
by the time he made a believer out of me, it was too late for me too.  do you think he can keep up this production?
Well, he can't go on like this; i mean he has, i think, six homers and about 15 RBI in about 15 games.  no one can keep up that pace.
You're right; at some point the pitchers will pick up on his weaknesses.  he's due to go into a slump.
but even if he does, he has shown the Dodgers were correct in bringing him up from the minors.  Enjoy the games tonight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, last night I went to the Mariners game.
Really? Nice. Who were they playing?
They were playing against their main rival.
Hmm, you must be talking about the Oakland A's then!
Exactly! You must be a true fan then if you know that!
Well yeah, I've been going to Mariners games since the Kingdome days!
Ahh yes, the good ole Kingdome! I actually kind of miss that place.
Yeah, me too, but Safeco field is much nice. You have to admit it.
I do. It's a great place to play baseball.
So anyway, I didn't catch the game last night. Did the M's win or what?
Oh yeah, it was a tight game for a while but then we broke out in the bottom of the seventh and scored 3 off a 3 run homer with 2 outs.
Nice, always good to beat the A's.
Yes it is. With that win we swept the series against them in Seattle.
Where did you sit?
Well, I have season tickets so I sit in the same spot which is just behind the visitors dugout, 4 rows deep.
You have season tickets? Hmm, I didn't know that! Very nice indeed. Is it worth it?
It is nice but only if you are going to making it to most games. If you can't make it then you are wasting your money.
Did you get any foul balls?
Nope, had one that came close but the guy behind me was a bit quicker.
Ahh, too bad. I remember one year I snagged a home run in left field with my bare hands, It was back in the Kingdome days. Seattle was playing against Minnesota and I was set up in left field for batting practice. I can't remember who it the homer but I know it was someone on the Twins. That was an epic day for me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe those Colorado Rockies?
What about them?
They're playing really well right now
The Colorado Rockies?
Yeah, I couldn't believe it either.
When was the last time they played well?
It's been awhile, I can't remember for sure
Didn't they go to the World Series one year?
Yeah, but I believe they were swept
Do you remember who they played?
I think it was the Boston Redsox
Oh yeah, that's right. Back in 2007.
Yeah that's right
Terry Francona was the Red Sox coach
Yeah, that's right..I remember Curt Schilling was still pitching for the Red Sox back then
Curt Schilling!!! Man, he's a nut job now.
Yeah, he's kind of become a political talking head
So, the Rockies are playing well now eh?
Yeah, best record in baseball right now
Crazy, I don't remember them ever playing that well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that hot take about fielding rules?
Like, what, changes?
Possible changes to the ruleset.
Proposed, right?
Not officially.
So, it's like a casual discussion thing.
Absolutely.
What's the details of it?
Changing the rules for pop flies and homeruns.
What specifically with homeruns.
Changing the way umpires read balls the audience plays.
Interesting.
It's rare though.
I don't think I can remember a time the audience affected something seriously.
It doesn't happen so often.
It's a rare rule.
I guess that makes sense.
Yeah, same.
I'm ambivalent.
It's an ambivalent sport.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You think the Nationals will keep Harper?
I dont know. I dont see why they wouldnt.
They havent approached him about an extension.
Probably gonna cost a half a billion.
They print money in baseball.
Yeah but thats alot of money.
Its the way salaries are going.
We all thought A-Rod's was insane.
Trout might top Harper's.
Nah, Harper will get the most.
I dont think so. Trout has had a better career.
Yeah true but hes always had good protection.
Well the Nats trot out some sluggers.
Daniel Murphy isnt Albert Pujols.
Pujols is a shell of himself.
Yeah Angels probably regret that decision.
Who wouldnt?
Yankees. They can pay anyone.
Thats where Harper goes I bet.
Doesnt anyone want to unseat them? Its not fair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the cardinal game yesterday?
Yeah.
It was so good wasn't it?
It was.
I'm so happy that the cards are back on track.
THat was a rough beginning
Yeah, but It's the St Louis Cardinals - they were bound to bounce back
It's a long season.
THat is for sure.  I love watching Mike Matheny manage this team
I wasn't sure that was the right move a few years back.
HOw do you feel now?
I think it's partly him and partly because of St Louis history.
Yeah, St Louis has always been a great organization
You are a little bias
Well sure - I'm bias, I live here.
I will say I've noticed there haven't been as many fans lately.
Well that is partly because of the floods in our town.
True, they had to close down highways right?
Yep.  SO that has affected the turnout.  ALso, the blues were in the playoffs.
Yeah.  I'm just so happy the Cardinals are back at it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does Gleyber Torres get called up to the majors?
Probably 2018.
Really? You don't think he gets the call sooner with his performance?
There's not really a roster opening at the moment.
Oh come on, he's gotta be better than some of the bench guys.
He's in Double-A, it's not common to jump a guy up that quick to put him on the bench. It's a waste of money.
How will you know if it's a waste of money if he hasn't even played yet?
It's an accounting and management issue. He's a controllable asset and you don't want to start his service clock where he becomes more expensive unless he can contribute.
Huh. But you have to expect some roster moves in terms of injuries and moves across the duration of the season.
If they compete and he really does well, I can possibly see him getting a September call-up but I wouldn't pencil it in as likely.
The Yankees will need him in the playoffs.
Where is he going to play? They have Gregorius, Castro, Torreyes in the middle infield.
Like I said, things change over the course of the season.
Put it like this, would you rather have Torres for a whole extra year or for a few games off the bench in September.
I get your point, but it seems to me that you'd want all hands on deck for a playoff run.
You Yankees fans just want everybody on your team no matter what lol.
We want to win.
Yankees are actually back to building their team the right way with these young players. No need to rush everybody.
I guess  you're right. They've done a good job through trades and stuff.
I'd be more worried about pitching than adding another infielder to an embarrassment of riches.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about what Cincinnati's Joey Votto said to that kid?
No, why, what happened?
Cincinnati was playing in San Francisco, and this kid asked Votto if he could have his batting gloves.
Ok, that sounds like the type of thing players get asked a lot.
Yes, But Votto's answer wasn't what a lot of players would have said!
Why, what did he say?
He told the kid that he was sitting in the front row and that he was 'elite'.
You mean like he's saying this kid isn't worthy of his gloves?
Exactly! He said the kid was privileged and not some "Make A Wish: kid.
Ouch! That seems awfully harsh for a baseball star!
I know, you'd think he could've handled it better.
There are nicer ways of saying no than calling a kid 'elite' and 'privileged'!
Yes, I thought it made Votto look pretty classless.
It makes him sound like he's not it in for the fans, just for being praised when he helps out needy kids.
I sure bet that one kid didn't have any praise for him.
I bet he had a new favorite team immediately after that.
You almost couldn't blame the kid if he was rude back.
I know. That's what you teach kids when you're rude to them!
It's not like the kid did anything terrible.
No he didn't. You'd think players would want to encourage all young fans, even if h didn't give his gloves to him.

Trivia time.
Ok. Fine,bring it.
Who had the most homeruns over his career?
Easy. Barry Bonds. 762. He passed Hank Aaron's record in 2007.
yes, but who has the most homeruns in a single season and how many?
Easy again. Barry Bonds. 73. the year of our good lord, 2001.
Ok. I'm going to stump you sooner or later. Let's see. Most strikeouts in his career?
That's even easier than the homerun count. Nolan Ryan with 5714. The Second is Randy Johnson, but 839 less than Ryan
Most strikeouts in a single season.
This is actually pretty interesting. It's Matt Kilroy, but from the year 1886, in the 20th century, again, Nolan Ryan with 383 in 1973
Who stole the most bases?
Rickey Henderson 1406.
Who stole the most bases in a single season?
Rickety Henderson again with 130 stolen bases in the 1982 season. But that's limiting ourselves to the 20th century. Hugh Nicol had 138 in 1887.
Ok, then who stole the most home base? Over the entire career
Stealing home isn't common, so this number is pretty small. And it's not kept as a record separately from the other steals.
You've been stumped
Maybe.
Admit it.
No. Ty Cobb has 54 home steals. But it's not an official stat from the MLB. it's not that I don't know, but rather it's not kept a record of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Yankees vs Redsox game?
Yea, what a great game!
I cant believe it went into extra innings.
Yea, the bullpens pitched great though.
Chris Sale pitched a great game.
Ya, he was on all night.
He had 12 strikeouts in 8 innings.
Ya, the only blemish was the two run homerun by sanchez
Yep, He hung that one slider
One bad pitch is all it takes sometimes.
Tanaka was masterful too
Yes, not as many strikeouts, but he held them to one run in 7 innings
The Redsox hitters couldnt square up any of his pitches
I know, he changed speeds and locations very well, avoiding hard contact
The Defense was great on both sides, especially the Jackie Bradley Jr catch
Yes, hes a great center fielder.  Ellsbury also made a nice play in center.
The umpires were very fair as well.
Ya, i like his strikezone.  it was very consistent
When is game 6?
Tomorrow night at 7:05pm
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did your brother do in his ball game last night?
Well, it actually almost got rained out.
Oh, I forgot that the weather was a mess.
Yeah, but they ended up being able to play.
Yuck.  I bet the field was nasty as heck.
Yep.  Those boys didn't care though.  They got as filthy as could be.
I remember those days.  Just playing in the mud.
Yeah, we had to hose off the guys before they left.  No one wanted them in their vehicles.
No kidding.  So how did they do?
It was a close game.  They got ahead and pulled it off though.  Score was 9-7.
Wow, must have been a hitter's game, huh?
Pretty much.  Mud made the defense hard.
I could understand that.  How'd your brother do?
He went 2 for 3 and had a walk.
Not bad at all.  Where'd he play?
He was third base last night.  Saw a good bit of hits, but like I said, the mud.
Eh, so he wasn't able to make all the plays.
Not all of them.  He actually lost his shoe in the mud once!
That's funny!  I wish I had been there!
Oh, you definately would have loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How bout those Giants?
What do you mean? They're like 6 games under .500.
Yeah, but those three titles in a row were great.
Yeah they were. I loved the 2014 World Series against the Royals.
When is Maddy coming back?
Probably after the all star break sometime.
Are you a Giants fan too?
Yes, but I am realistic about them.
Well, miracles happen.
I bet they can comeback after the all star break.
Do you think the Dodgers are good?
They have only one pitcher and Justin Turner just got hurt.
Yeah that will hurt them.
Do you like the Mets?
No
Their pitching staff is unfortunate.
Yeah, they have to pretend Harvey is actually an ace.
I am excited for the playoffs.
This might be the Nationals year.
Some Giants fan you are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the  San Diego Padres on Thursday, Mike?
Nope. I had dinner plans and went out with the wife. How was it?
With that a 4-2 win over the San Diego Padres, the Brewers are in first place.
That win was their ninth in 11 games.
Yeah. They are doing good.
Losing two of the last eleven games isn't too bad at all.
Of course every loss hurts when you are trying to get into the playoffs.
Yeah, they do have long odds.
Especially in a tough NL Central where you know the Chicago Cubs haven't yet played their best baseball.
They say the computers are giving  them about 2 percent odds of winning the division, about 10 percent of making the playoffs.
Dang. The computers don't like their odds too much but what do computers know?
Only what you tell them.
Dang straight.
But you know what, though? It's still  fun to be in first place!
I couldn't agree with you more.
I think this season's playoff will be very interesting.
I might try to see a game or two in person.
Really? If you do, let me know.
You want to go to the ball park too?
Of course! I have to support my team.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite baseball club?
The Boston Red Sox, what is your favorite?
I love the Red Sox too! Who is your favorite player on the team?
Pedroia, he's been so loyal to the team and he's hard not to love as a player, how about you?
I'm a former college pitcher, so I'd go with Price.
Wow, but he's really struggled in the playoffs in his career.
I think that's mostly just statistical variance, baseball has so much randomness and chance in it.
Yeah, I feel like ESPN and other sports publications try to make narratives and stories whether they exist or not.
Definitely, Price is a very skilled pitcher, and those skills will translate into playoff wins if he's given chances.
Do you think the Sox have what it takes to go all the way this year?
Haha, it's hard to say no. They were one of the favorites in the pre-season.
Yeah, I wonder if their relative youth will make a big playoff run harder.
Hopefully the guys with experience like my boy Pedroia will show them how it's done and be strong leaders.
Yeah, it's hard to underestimate the value of guys like that in the locker room.
What about Xander Bogaerts?
Oh man, he is awesome. I love watching him play.
Yeah, he really shows why the Red Sox have been so successful in the past 15 years.
Yeah, after so many issues for 70+ years, the front office and scouting teams really have stepped up their game!
Well here's to the Sox winning it all this year!
Hear hear! I hope Price will be the World Series MVP!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like baseball?
Sure it's ok.
Do you follow any teams?
Not really during the season, it's too long.
Yeah true, ever been to a game?
Once or twice.
What team did you go see?
The Texas Rangers.
Cool, I hear their ballpark is nice.
It's pretty nice but not near the tradition of someone like the Red Sox or Cubs.
Yea, they're a pretty young franchise all things considered.
Agreed, did you see the world series they played against the Cardinals?
Yeah that was a good one, went all 7 games.
Yes I couldn't believe the Rangers lost game 6.
I know right?! They were within 1 strike of winning the whole series and the Cardinals came back and won.
I was stunned, and my dad was pretty upset.
Is he a Rangers fan?
Yeah he's been a fan for a while.
I've only been watching for 5 years.
I followed it off and on but my dad's been watching it since way back in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer’s table.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long were you a Yankee fan?
Oh gosh since the glory days when i was a kid.
Who was playing then?
My favorite was Mickey Mantle
Did you see him play?
Yes my dad used to take me to games and I saw him play several times
What did you see him do?
One time he hit a homer into the upper deck and the ball bounced off the top pf a sign and bounced into the section we were sitting in.
Was it a big game?
It was a important game with the Red Sox and my dad was able to catch the ball because we were in a thinly populated section of the bleachers.  It was a walk off homer, it won the game.
Wow, cool what happened to the ball?
I still have it and my dad was somehow able to get the Mick to sign it after the game.  He was really nice and patted me on the head.
Any other special Yankee games?
Yeah, we got tickets to the 1977 World Series, the first one for the Yankees that they won in 13 years.
What do you remember?
The best memory was when Reggie Jackson hit three home runs on three pitches to win the game.  Those Dodgers could not get over that.
What did you see.
We were in the lower deck on the third base side and saw Reggie swing with all he had and drive the ball into another zip code.
Ha ha that must have been cool.
Yeah, that was before players got paid so much that they became corporations in themselves, they really loved to play and you might get to meet some of them.  Those were the good old days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Afternoon.
Hi.
How are you?
Well and you?
Yep good.  You like baseball?
Yeah I like it.
Do you have a favorite team?
Yeah I'm a Sox fan.
White or Red?
The Red Sox.
Oh okay.  You from Boston?
Yeah born and bred.
Oh okay neat.
Do you have a team?
Yeah I like the Rangers.
You from Texas.
That's where I grew up, don't live there anymore.
I see.
Good chatting.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, let's go to a baseball game. It's supposed to be a nice day.
Well, ok, darn it. Who's playing?
The Twins are playing blah blah blah.
Why do you phrase it like that? I kind of want to know.
Does it matter? The Twins could lose the Springfield Isotopes.
Well, ok, let's go. We're here already. Man, that was fast.
God bless the light rail that only travels in one direction. It was pretty fast though. But it did take us 40 minutes to get to the parking lot at the Mall.
Twins!!!!!!!!!! Let's go!!!!!  Aaarg! Actually, I want a hot dog.
I want some beer. Let's grab two or three or twelve. I brought my Mom's credit card.
We can't carry all of these to our seats. I guess we'll have to stand here and drink them. We can watch on one of the many high definition screens in this beautiful and still clean concourse.
Hey, everyone is yelling. What happened?
Man, look at that tight shirt. You say something?
I gotta go. Can you hold my beer?
I have to go too. Let's bring them with. The line will be long anyway and standing makes me thirsty.
Everyone is yelling again. What happened? Hey you, you know what happened? Mauer got on base!?! That calls for a drink.
He'll get tagged out. He's slower than Denny Green on salad day.
What happened? I can't hear over my own tinkle. Mauer's headed toward second?
Ohhh, he tripped. Well, he did get in sight of second base. He's improving.
Look at me. I'm drinkin' while peeiing. Weeeee! I'm a filter.
This is the best game ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Pirates and Nationals game yesterday?
No, who won?
The Pirates won 10-4. It was a great game.
Did Bryce Harper have any hits?
Yes, I believe he got 2 hits.
Wow. He is supposed to get a really big contract next year.
I know. I wonder if the Nationals will keep them.
He is going to ask for over 400 million dollars.
Do you think they will pay him?
It depends on whether they have the money.
I'm sure that won't be a problem. I hope they keep Ryan Zimmerman too.
He has been having a great season so far.
I agree, even at his old age.
How old is he now?
I think he is in his late 30's. Most of his time was spent in the minor leagues.
Wow, that is a great story.
When is the next game?
I am not sure. I am going to watch the Red Soz and Athletics tonight.
Who do you think will win?
The Red Sox look good this week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Boston Red Sox are my favorite MLB team.
When I was growing up, Wade Boogs, Dwight Evans and Roger Clemens were my favorite Red Sox players.
My father's work had partial season tickets for the Red Sox and I went to about 100 games. I went to game 1 of the 1988 playoffs vs. Oakland.
Even though they were blown out in that game, it is was alot of fun to be at the park that night. Quite an event for sure!
The home team was booed by the crowd as they were in the process of getting destroyed. It was pretty classic Boston sports fans behavior.
Red Sox fans in specific, and Boston sports fans in general, a tough to please. You need to produce or they turn on you.
The fans are similar to Philly fans in that regard. Tough to please.
During my high school and college years of the late 80s into the mid 90s, the Red Sox slowly worsened and became a very bad team. I still watched them as often as I could.
The strike year of 94 was devastating. Not to only the Red sox, but baseball in general.
You see, Red Sox fans would come back and show interest in the team no matter what. But other teams did not have that luxury.
The strike of 94 almost killed baseball. But the yankees becoming a dynasty and all of the HRs hit during the steroid era rescued it.
Though they are now regarded as cheaters, sluggers like Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds made the country pay attention to them.
Though they cheated and used steroids, they were megastars. And baseball turned its eyes on the cheaters so it could prosper again.
The Yankees of the mid to late 90s and most of the 2000s helped too. They were a great team that I hated but respected.
Until 2004, it seemed like they were playing with the Red Sox.
Even after Pedro dominated the Yankees for the 1st half of his career, New York figured him out and was a thorn in his side.
Though Pedro battled and battled, he was only 170 pounds and often ran out of gas vs, the Yankees. The New Yorkers were patient and made him tire.
It was a battle to watch though! The greatness of Pedro vs. the grittiness of New York.
Eventually it worked out in the Red Sox favor in 2004, but it took an awfully long time for us Sox fans to get there.
It was well worth the wait though! 86 years of frustration gone!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cubs play the Cardinals Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
Are you going to attend?
I wish I were.
I have some extra tickets.
I would love to go, but I can't afford the tickets.
I will sell them to you half price.
Oh, I wouldn't  feel right about allowing you to do that.
Hey, we are good friends.
Yes, but I just would not feel good about not paying full price.
I would love for you to go to the game with me.  I made some extra money this week and can afford to let you have them half price.
Oh, that's so nice of you.  I will talk to Ray and see what he says.
It would be fun if you go; Mary is going too.
I will let you know tomorrow evening.
Well, I sure hope you decide to go with me and Mary.
I know Ray would enjoy going to see the Cubs play.
Yes, he would - he's been a Cub for a long time.
He sure has - 65 years...
Well, I sure hope you will go.  We will have a good time.
I talked to Ray and he said that we will go with you and Mary.
Great! Just what I was hoping to hear!  We will pick you guys up around 8 in the morning Friday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that kid Sindergaard pitch for the Mets?
Yeah, his hair is longer than his arms.
I don't like how the bullpen is performing.
They're giving up too many leads.
I don't think we're getting enough production out of second base.
We haven't had a good second basement in years.
I can't believe they offered him a five year contract.
I know, he hasn't hit over .300 since 2013.
That guy has a great curveball.
All of his pitches have a lot of movement.
That guy behind the plate calls a good game
He seems to have a good relationship with the pitching staff.
I don't think they're going to win 80 games this year.
If they're lucky, they'll win 70.
Who do you think the opening day starter should be?
I heard they're going to let Johnson do it, because he's the only veteran.
Who is the best manager of all time?
I would probably say Lou Piniella.
Who is the greatest hitter you've ever seen in person?
I think George Brett is. He could spray the ball all over the park.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The cubs have lost 7 out of their last 10 games
I know it has been really frustrating as a Cubs fan
Right now their starting pitching has been awful
Not only that, but their once heralded defense has been abysmal too
They need to turn this ship around while they still have time
No doubt. Thanks God they are in a weak division
Exactly. They still have time to right the ship
We are only roughly 40 games in and they are hovering at the .500 mark
Yeah, I think they can turn this thing around still
I would hate for them to win last year and not even make the postseason this year
Yeah that would suck really bad
I just hope they turn it on here soon
I think when you win a championship, it's natural to have a letdown
I agree, but they gotta fight through it at this point
Some timely hitting would also do them so good
You are so right on that. The bats have been dead
Dead! more like they've been sitting with the grim reaper
Yeah for sure! They're not hitting anything right now
I'm just happy no one has run away with the division yet
Yeah me too. We still have time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite MLB team?
The Arizona Diamondbacks
Nice, they are off to a good start this year.
That they are but we'll see if they keep it up.
I'm a braves fan so I don't have much hope.
You must be really disappointed that Freeman got hurt.
Definitely, he was playing like an MVP.
He will be tough to replace but you got former Diamondback Swanson to lead you know.
The braves definitely got the better of that trade.
Do you follow any teams in the American League?
I follow Cleveland because my dad is a fan of them.
He must be loving the last couple of years.
He's still not that impressed but he's very biased.
Wow, he should be thrilled.
I know but he is a very critical sports fan.
Do you follow college baseball at all?
I do. I follow my alma mater, Florida State.
Nice, they've been so close to winning it all so many times.
I know, maybe this year is the year.
I root for Texas so I'm hopeful as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the World Series last year?
I sure did. I'm an Indian's fan.
I was rooting for the Cubs.
I'm originally from Cleveland, so I have always like the Indians.
They seem to have a good chance to win it this year.
The AL Central isn't too strong, so they should be able to make it to the playoffs.
They definitely have a good bullpen.
Yeah, Andrew Miller and Cody Allen are both very good.
Who do you think will be in the World Series this year?
I predict it will be the Cubs and Indians again.
How do you think it will turn out?
I think the Indians will probably win this year with all their players being healthy again.
Who's your favorite player?
I would have to say Michael Brantley.
Are you planning on going to any games at Progressive Field this year?
I hope to go to at least a few.
Do you prefer to watch baseball live or on television?
I would rather watch live. Being apart of the crowd is a great experience.
Maybe my Cubs will just end up playing your Indians again.
If so, we should attend the game.

Hi
Hi
How are you?
Well, you?
Good.
That's good.
We're supposed to talk baseball?
Yep.  Do you like baseball?
Yeah I do.  You?
Yeah I like baseball sure.
Do you have a team?
Hmm let me think.
I'm trying to think about it as well.
I guess it would be the Bluejays, they're the closest team to me.
Oh okay, Canada interesting.
Yeah, what about you.
I like the Yankees.
Ah okay.
Good talking to you.
You too.

Hello
Hi
How are you?
Doing good.  How are you?
Not bad.
That's good.
Are you a baseball fan?
Yep, I really like baseball.
Did you ever play?
I played a little bit.
Oh interesting, when did you play?
I played a bit in high school.
Cool.
Did you ever play?
I only played little league.
Ah okay, yeah I played little league as well.
We weren't very good.
Us either.
Good talking to you.
Bye.

Do you remember the last time the Dodgers won a world series.
Yup,1988.
I was 7 years old.
I was 10.
Kirk Gibson was the hero.
Yup,I child still see that game in my head.
Do you remember who was pitching?
Oh yeah,
Who?
Oral hershiser
That was the best.do you think they have a chance this year?
I hope so.with Kershaw on the mound and Gonzales
Plus they have seger.
He is of the hook right now.
This is his 2nd season with them.did you see him last year?
Yes I did. I think he leading in hits for the team.
I would not be surprised.
Did you get one of his bobble head?
No, can I have yours?
No way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Phillies game yesterday?
Yeah they are not a good team.
Why do you say that?
Their pitching is terrible.
Is it relief or starting?
A little bit of both.
Whats worse?
I would say the relief pitching. Numbers wise.
Yeah the starter's ERA is not that bad.
I think it could be increased if they let them continue to pitch.
What do you mean?
They yank them in the 5th almost every game.
OK so that expends the relievers?
Yes and they arent that good to begin with.
So what do you think they need to do?
I would go build out the starting pitching first.
Once you can get through 6 then you go to the pen
So they dont need a closer?
Wait until theyre good
I understand
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the funniest thing you've ever seen at a baseball game?
I absolutely lose it when people go out of their way to get a foul ball or a home run, and suffer the consequences.
Yeah, when a ball lands in their awful beer or their food and it explodes, I laugh my butt off.
One thing I love to see never happens during the game, but something we learn about after the fact.
What's that?
When they have the kiss cam on, and one person in a couple is caught cheating on their partner.
That's sick.
Why?
You're enjoying people's personal affairs being ruined.
They deserved it. They went into public and cheated in an area where their faces are broadcast.
Anyway, have you ever caught a home run?
Yes, sort of.
Sort of? How do you not know? Did you confuse it with ... how do you not get it?
It was during batting practice at the Reds game. I went down during the last batter, and he hit it right at me.
You caught it?
Yeah, and I reached over a little kid to get it, caught it in my hand with no glove, to impress my girlfriend.
You took a ball from a kid?
No, I caught the ball instead of the kid catching it.
Taking a home run from a child is pretty much the worst thing anyone can do at a baseball stadium
No, not really. This kid will have another 80 years to catch a foul ball or home run. I have limited time. I don't care about that kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Dodgers game last night?
No. I was watching a different game.
It's too bad that you missed it.
Why's that?
It was a 9-0 shut-out.
Wow. The Dodgers are doing great this year.
They sure are. What game were you watching?
I was watching the Red Sox and Yankees.
They are such an intense rivalry.
They are. That's why I usually try to catch their games.
So, who won?
The Yankess beat the Sox 2-1 in extra innings.
How late did the game go?
I watched until about 11:30 until I finally had to go to bed.
How many innings was it.
Oh, I think it went to like the 15th inning or something like that.
Wow. When games drag on like that sometimes it just becomes too much baseball.
Yes. The whole thing was a real ptichers battle.
I'm not surprised. Both teams have really good pitching staffs.
I think so too. Their sluggers usually don't do much when they play against each other.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Montreal.
They're good at fighting.
They're absurdly good at fighting.
They love to fight.
They love to kill.
Same.
They murder like nothing.
I mean, that's me.
Murder players.
They're good at short-games.
They're terrible at getting the puck.
They love to not get the puck.
They don't ever get it but when they do they kill.
Yeah, they love that.
They're actually terrible at play but they're amazing at fighting.
Haha, yeah.
They can't play hockey for garbage.
That's kinda true.
But they play fists like nothing else.
Of course.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Yankees's game the other night?
You mean the one where they retired Jeter's number?
Yes, that one.
I sure did, wasn't it a great night?
Absolutely, he was such a great player.
Agreed, how about the crowd?
They were on fire.
Right, they really gave him quite a round of applause.
Yes, it was thunderous and well deserved.
I agree, Jeter will go down as one of the best Yankees ever.
He'll go down as one of the greatest players ever.
That's true too but I think he will be a NY legend.
Oh yeah, he's the king of New York right now don't you think?
Yes, even in retirement he's probably the most popular Yankee right now.
I bet sales of #2 jerseys are selling off the shelves right now
Oh I'm sure they're selling a ton of his jerseys right now.
And the Yankees really wore the Astros out after the ceremony.
What was the final score, I didn't watch it all.
The Yankees won 11-6
Sounds like I missed a great game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello there.
Doing well?
Yep, you?
Yes.  You like baseball?
I do like baseball.
Same here.
Ever been to a game?
I have when I was a kid.
Haven't been sense you were an adult?
No, but I always talk about going.
You should go it's a lot of fun.
There is a local team near me that we always talk about going to.
You really should go, it's a great time.
Also great for the family.
That's right.
I go quite a bit.
That's nice.
Well, nice chatting with you.
You too.

One thing I will never forget in my lifetime is the night in 2004 when the Boston Red Sox won the world series. I remember waking up at 3-4AM and literally pinching myself and asking if that really happened.
One of my earliest memories is baseball ffrom the early 80s. My brother's favorite player was George Brett.
When Vince Coleman broke in with the Cardinals in 1985, I had never seen anything like him. He was the fastest human being I had ever seen.
The Red Sox were always my favorite team. No other team was even close.
When the Red sox lost the World Series in 1986, it broke my heart. Even though the games were on too late for me to watch the whole thing.
The Red sox were big underdogs against the Mets. The Mets were probably the best team in a decade.
The ALCS between the Angels and the Red Sox was a classic. I remember distinctly game 5 which the Red sox won when they should of lost.
Dave Henderson hit a homerun in extra innings in that game. That ultimately broke the Angels spirits.
Several years later the pitcher who gave up that homerun committed suicide. What a tragedy!
The 1986 Red Sox had Wade Boggs and Rogel Clemens. They were two of the best young players in the game.
Several years later, it was found out those 2 players had alot of personal demons. They are still HOF players.
Wade Boggs was addicted to sex. Roger Clemens was addicted to himself!
Both players eventually won WorldSeries with the Yankees. That made me sick.
Though I hate the Yankees, I have to respect them. They won so many World Series titles.
Especially in the late 1990s, the Yankees were good. The 1998 team was the best I ever saw.
They had so many gritty players. They were not superstars.
They just played well as a team. And they found a way to beat you.
Pedro Martines vs. the Yankees of the 1990s was much see TV. I could not keep my eye of those games.
Though honestly, Pedro vs. anyone was much see TV. He was that great.
Pedro in his prime was the best piutcher I had ever seen. No one else was really close in my opinion.

Hey, how's it going? Did you happen to see the last Pirate's game?
Oh hey! I'm doing good! And yeah, I finally caught a game; their last one.
They didn't play very well, did they? That was a pretty solid loss to the Phillie's huh?
Yeah, you're right. They really seem to be having a hard time gaining any momentum this year.
Yeah, I think you're right. It looked like they would be able to start the season off fairly strong too.
For sure. But then they lost like 6 or 7 games in a row. You just can't do that in their division.
You are so right. Their division is just too competitive to allow for a losing streak like that.
Well, I guess the only good news is that pretty every team in the division isn't necessarily playing their best right now.
That's too. Even with those losses the Pirates are only 8 or 9 games out of first place, which is at least something.
Oh yeah, for sure. They just need to really start picking up games that they shouldn't be losing.
I know exactly what you mean! They seem to have this terrible habit of dropping games to certain teams that just always have their number.
Oh, totally! Like the Brewers! The Pirates are a way more talented club right now. No way they should be dropping games to the Brewers.
Or teams like the Dodgers. I know the Dodgers are a better team, but still, they seem to always consistently give the Pirates a hard time.
You're right! There just always seem to be those teams that the Pirates just can't beat no matter what!
Yeah, that is just it. Well at least they picked up a few wins against the Nationals. DC is a pretty good team; that might be a good sign for the rest of the season.
You could be right, there. The other good thing is that it is still pretty early in the season; they have plenty of time to turn things around.
I hope so. And you're right about time; I don't think I will really get worried about the season until after the All-Star game.
Let's just hope they can build a little momentum before then!
Oh, for sure. I am pretty confident they will.
I hope you're right! Let's go Bucs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about that Yankee/Cubs matchup the other night?
Whew, 18 innings.
There were a record 48 strikeouts in the game.
That record will stand for a while
The Cardinals are in first place now.
They've won four in a row and have overtaken the Reds and Cubs.
Can Bryce Harper carry the Nationals to the promised land?
This should be their year with all that starting pitching.
Can the iIndians get back to the World Series for the second straight year?
I think the odds are against them in the Junior Circuit.
Stan Musial doesn't seem to get the respect he deserves from the national media.
For a guy that won seven NL batting titles and was on three World Series winners, you are correct.
What is going on with the commissioner wanting to put runners on second base during extra inning games?
It's the dumbest idea ever.
Can we agree that the DH has to go?
Yes, but the players union will raise a stink about it.
The Yankees are on fire so far this year.
They're doing it without big stars.
I know.  I can't name one player off the top of my head.
Different from prior winning teams they've had.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Boy the Mets are really spiraling out of control.
They have looked horrible lately.
yeah everything seems to have fell apart for this team
These guys have lost 7 in a row.
Yeah and 8 out of their last 10
It doesn't get any easier because they have to face an Angels team with Mike Trout
Well they have DeGrom on the mound tonight, maybe they can get a win.
They desperately need it. Right now they are 8 1/2 games behind the Nationals
They can't worry about the Nationals right now. They have to worry about not dropping to last place
Yeah, things had started out so well for this team this year.
Yeah they were 0-6 this last road trip. Abysmal.
Yeah and they are going up against Trout who has hit 5 home runs in 6 games
Yeah this couldn't be worse for the Mets
I smell another loss coming to this team.
Maybe they can right the ship. It is still early in the season and anything can happen.
Maybe you are correct, but they better start turning this thing around fast.
Yeah they have definitely looked like a underachieving ball club.
Exactly and their pitching has left a lot to be desired.
Their startes are not giving them quality innings right now.
Nope. And I fear more of the same tonight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Nationals game Thursday?
No, I did not get the chance. How did they do?
They lost, four to ten.
Who did they play again?
They were playing the Pirates.
Oh, I follow them a bit. But I follow the Mariner more, did you catch any of that game.
They won right?
Yeah, beat the White Sox by one point. How do you think they will do this season?
I mean they are looking pretty good. The White Sox had a decent season and they still managed to beat them.
I think they will do great. I hope the Mariners make it all the way.
They played again yesterday.
They lost though, but not by a lot. Just one point.
I seen that game. They really tried, it was a close one.
They play again Tuesday.
How do you think they will do?
Up against the Nationals? I think they have a fighting chance. Would give them a leg up in the season
I think they can beat them. I mean they are not he best, and the Mariners had a strong few games.
I kind of hope they do. Would be nice to see them make it all the way, maybe even win.
I do not think they could make it that far! But who knows.
I think they should win the world series, they deserve it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the fastest fast ball ever measured?
105.1 mph
By...
Aroldis Chapman. Cincinnati reds, during the game against San Diego Padres.
I was watching this tv show about biomechanics, I think that was about Aroldis.
Was it about strides, shoulder turn, delivery etc?
I think so, it was pretty good. It was on sports science.
Well, there are few biomechanic traits that go into a fast ball.
Such as?
Well the very first thing most of us look at is the stride. Well, actually, to start off there are 6 stages of motion. Windup, stride, arm cocking, arm acceleration, arm deceleration, and follow through. That's what a pitch is.
And the windup does what?
Windup stores the potential energy you will release as you go into the stride and helps you get a good stride going. Some pitchers don't have a big windup.
Is that disadvantageous?
Not as long as you can move the stride along. Just lifting the leg briefly can get your stride going no problem.
And the stride is when you convert the potential energy into kinetic energy?
well, you will convert it to mechanical motion or energy first, kinetic energy won't come into play until you release the ball. Stride is to get that motion going and at the same time start the arm cocking or extend your arm back to start the forward motion.
That's what it's called? really?
Yep. And as the stride ends, the foot plants on the ground, the arm stretched back will start to move forward, and this is the start of the release phase. And you do that by accelerating your arm towards the home base.
Then release and follow through.
Yep
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Royals and Orioles game yesterday?
Yes, it was exciting the Orioles almost came back and won.
I just can't believe the Royals were losing 5-0 in the bottom of the 4th inning and then ended up tying by the end of the inning.
Really, they scored 5 runs in one inning?
Yes, it was exciting to see especially the Moustakas homerun.
Wow! That is amazing, what is that number 9 so far this year.
Yeah I believe so, its either number 9 or 10.
I am really surprised the Orioles didn't come back to win it.
What do you mean, the Royals were winning for the most part after the 4th inning.
Yeah, but in the top of the 9th the Orioles started to rally.
Ohhh you were talking about the 9th inning I thought you were talking about the rest of the game.
No, I was talking about the 9th, It seams that the Royals were playing strong until the 9th.
Yeah, I am not too confident in the Royals bullpen after about inning number 7.
Yeah, I have to agree it seams that the bullpen starts to fall apart.
Sometimes it get frustrating as the Royals will have the lead most of the game and then their bullpen will blow it.
Yeah, your telling me.  They should have won all games last series, but their bullpen messed it up.
It also doesn't help that the bats for the Royals haven't been that strong.
It seams their offense is in a little bit of a slump, hopefully it ends soon.
Yeah I think it will.
Usually around the all star- break is when teams really start to pick it up as it is time for playoffs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Boy, those Battlin' Bucs really took a turn toward the basement of the NL Central Again this year.
Yes, don't remind me.
They really had a chance to do something special the past 3 to 4 years and blew it.
Surprisingly, yes. I thought I would never see the day they finished over .500 again.
Same here. I'm still having flashbacks to the early 1990's.
Yes, that was a difficult time. At least one of those teams should have won the world series.
They had a chance at a World Series the past few years also, but ran into a hot pitcher at the time.
Yes, they always ended up in a one game playoff against the hot pitcher at the time.
Arietta, and then that guy from the Giants. I can't think of his name.
I know who you are talking about. He pitched a gem against them in 2014.
Oh, what's his name?
Lincecum?
No, not him.
Oh, I know. It was that Bumgartner guy.
Yes, him. He was pitching like he was Sandy Koufax or something that year.
The Giants won three world series on pitching and mediocre offense.
Yes, they are one of the worst teams I've ever seen to win a World Series.
Well, worst or not, they won the World Series.
If only the Battlin' Bucs would win one more.
Yes, that would be the day. 1979 seems so long ago. Ugh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder how the Brewers and Cubs are dong today.
I was checking on the game and noticed it was postponed today.
I know they are playing in Chicago and it was wet and cold yesterday.
I am assuming it was called due to rain today.
I think they had an hour and a half delay yesterday because of weather.
You never know what the weather is going to be like in Chicago this time of the year.
Hopefully they will get a game in tomorrow.
I hope so as the Brewers are hot and they need to keep playing.
Who do you think is the better team, New York Yankees or the Baltimore Orioles?
I think I would put my omney on the Yankees because of their pitching staff.
Who do you think is the best team in the National League?
I still think it is the Cubs but, they need to get out of the funk they are in at present.
I am surprised to see how well the Arizona Diamondbacks are doing early in the season.
I agree but again, it boils down to pitching and they have a great staff.
I hope the Dodgers get playing better as they have a lot of talent that is not playing so well now.
I think they have enough talent to get better and better and win the West.
I would not be surprosed to see Clevel;and back in it in the American League again this year.
Been a long time since they have done much so yes, would be great to see them get back to the series.
I am going to see my first ball game in Miller park in Milwaukee on August 3rd.
Long way to go to see sa game but, I know you are a Brewer fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe the Yankees left the picture in after back-to-back home runs!
Yeah, then he loaded the bases and there was a grand slam.
I have tickets to the Cubs on Saturday, want to go?
I'd love to.  What time is the game on Saturday?
I was watching the Yankees and the Astros this week.  Everyone was wearing pink.  What's up with that?
It's for breast cancer awareness.  They are showing their support.
Did you watch the Braves game last night?
I tried to but it got rained out in the fifth inning.
I couldn't stay up to watch the Reds game.  How many innings did it go?
It went 15 innings.  It's almost like a double-header.  I was up very late.
Who won the Astro and Yankees last few games?
They played three games and it was two-one, Astros.
Did you see the altercation between the Red Sox GM and the home umpire?
Yes, he was kicking dust on the ump' and deserved to get kicked out of the game.
I can't believe the Orioles?  Can they get ever possibly get any worse?
I don't know how they could get much worse.  You would think they would be tired of losing.
I was just getting settled into the A's game and some fool spilled his drink on me. I missed the play.
Sorry.  You just missed the guy getting thrown out on second.
Did you see that?  That was almost a triple play!
Yeah, it could have been if the throw from third was better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'd like to know more about baseball.  What exactly is baseball?
It is a ball game between two teams of nine on a field with a diamond-shaped circuit of four bases.
It sounds fun and competitive.  Where is it played?
It is played in the US, Canada, Latin America, and East Asia.
What are the bases called?
First, second, third, and home plate.
What happens during baseball?
The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate.
It seems there is a lot going on with this sport.  Can you tell me more about it?
Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways. A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means.
You mention a pitcher. What are all of the positions played in baseball?
Pitcher, catcher, first baseman, second baseman, third baseman, shortstop, left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder.
How long does the game last?
A game is composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. Baseball has no game clock, although almost all games end in the ninth inning.
I'm anxious to know where this sport came from? Do you know where it was first played?
In the 18th century in England.
You know so much about baseball. How do you know so much?
I played softball when I was younger.  I like to watch baseball also in my free time and have researched a lot about the sport.
It was so nice talking to you about baseball and I thank you very much!  I really learned a lot.
You are welcome. I enjoyed talking about this sport I enjoy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Aroldis Chapman on the DL with shoulder issues.
Not good news.
Yeah, but the Yankees at least have Betances to fill in as a reliable closer.
That's good, but this is really bad for Chappy.
He's only on the 10 day DL, it can't be too bad.
Not necessarily, they put him on the 10 day disabled list to hold for evaluation.
So it could be worse than that?
Yes. Anytime you hear shoulder injury it is a reason for pause.
It is being reported as shoulder soreness, not bad.
Well rotator cuff for a pitchers is very serious. Lot of guys never get well.
You're right, Scott Kazmir might be one of the only guys to salvage something after major shoulder issues.
Right, and he had to change his style and it took years to get it back.
Now I'm worried.
Well it could be managed, but shoulder is serious opposed to elbow issues or other injuries.
Let's hope it's minor and he gets through it.
For his sake I do hope so. The guy throws hard and anything that jeopardizes that can be career threatening.
Yep. You have to think it's somewhat unsurprising that he would eventually have an issue.
Reminds me a little bit of Wood and Prior.
But Chapman is a reliever so maybe he has a better chance of working through it.
Probably why they made him a reliever in the first place, they had to know the risk of throwing that hard would be best in small doses.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how do you think the indians will make it to the series again this year?
I sure hope so i would like to see them win it, but im not sure i heard they lost some players.
Ya i heard that too, hopefully it wasn't anyone we needed.
I know speaking of what we need we need some more pitchers.
Ya i'll second that, the only thing i believe we are good on is the people in the outfield.
The indians outfield is pretty good, they were tearing it up last season.
Definitely were, although i cant remember his name but one guy was horrible, especially during the world series.
I think i know the guy your talking about, was he the one that kept getting waved off but ran in anyways to try and catch it.
Yep i remember he cost the indians an easy out because he messed up the guy that was waving him off.
That was pretty awful, hopefully the indians replaced him this year.
Have you gone and seen any games yet?
No I havent yet.
Thats a bummer I'm going up at the end of the month to see them play the royals.
O nice i hear its going to be a good game.
I heard that too, even if it isn't its still dollar a dog night!
O score, i love those nights.
Me too i always eat way more than i should.
You betting on the game?
I usually do, im betting my buddy they win by 3 runs.
I think thats a safe bet, i heard they are supposed to beat the royals fairly easily.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Astros this year?
They've got a good team.
Do you think they have a shot to make it to the World Series?
I think so, they are a well balanced team
What do you like about the team?
Their lineup is strong offensively, they have maybe the best bullpen in baseball and they are good defensively.
What do you think is their biggest weakness?
Right now, the staring pitching.  They should get one more quality starter for the fifth or sixth spot.
Do you think they will?
They have one of the best front offices in baseball.  I think they will get one.
Who do you think is their biggest obstacle in the American league?
Probably the Yankees.
Yeah, the Yankees are always loaded.  In fact, they're playing the Yankees tonight.
I know, it should be a great matchup.
Keuchel for the Astros and Pineda for the Yankees.
It doesn't get much better than that.
It will probably be the best game in baseball tonight.
I agree, it should be fun.
Are you going to watch it?
You bet, I've  already got my chips and beer ready.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who is playing tonight?
I don't know why?
I feeling like going to a bar to watch a game.
Let's go.
Let me look up to see who's playing.
It's the Cardinals and Mets.
That sounds like a boring game.
Yeah but one beer will make it better.
That's true.
I saw the Mets last year.
Cool where?
In L.A..
Who did they play?
They played the angles.
Did the angles win?
Yes.
Was it a good game?
It was ok I guess.
Would you want to see them play again?
No, it was a sad game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you see the Cubs at the Reds the other night?
I didn't, but I can imagine how that one turned out...
7-5 Cubs baby! What it is that you like about Cincinatti again?
Well it's not their starting pitchers, that's for sure
Joey Votto still drawing the big bucks?
Yeah, but is he turning out the numbers?
Eleven homers so far this year, not the worst.
Yeah but I'd like to see more.  Cozart on the other hand...
Yeah, there you go.  Batting what like .400 these days?
Eh, more like .350.  But I got no complaints.
So what do you like best about the team?
The bullpen, these days.  Those guys are all that's saving that pitching staff
Like who are you thinking of?
Iglesias, Brice, Peralta.  Those guys can hold a close game if they're given the chance
But starting wise?
They can't keep an ERA under 4.0.  Which is no way to win games
Arroyo?
He gets the strikeouts, but if you give a hitter a piece of that slow moving train...
Its outta the park.
That's what I'm sayin.  Forget the Reds, I don't wanna get bummed out here. You wanna go get a beer?
XXXXXXXXXXX
How in the world are the Minnesota Twins leading the AL Central
Yeah this is a great surprise to me too.
Right now they have been road warriors. They have one of the best road records in baseball.
Yeah they have won 11 and lost 5 on the road so far.
Not bad. Not bad at all. This is what has allowed them to be in first place.
Yeah, but they shouldn't be jumping for joy because they are only .500 at home.
Indeed. They are also only one game ahead of the Tigers and Indians.
Yeah those teams are right on their heels. No time to sleep.
For sure, this maybe a battle all the way to the end of the season between these teams.
Yeah, but I have to believe that the Cleveland Indians may be the best team in this division.
These guys were really close to winning it all last year. People have forgotten that quickly
I agree with you. This is a dangerous team that is not getting the respect that they deserve.
Yeah I think they will overtake the Twins in no time.
The Twins are just not good enough to sustain this division over 162 games.
However, if they keep playing this well on the road and begin to hit at home anything is possible.
Yeah, but that is a lot of "ifs". I just don't see it happening.
It would be a really cool story though if they could pull it off.
Well don't hold your breath because the Twins are going down.
Sometimes baseball is funny and the best team doesn't always win.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How are the Nats doing this season?
Pretty well! Leading their division.
Think they'll make the postseason?
Pretty confident.
Who else could knock them out?
The NL East isn't looking great this year, I think they'll win the division pretty easily.
Yeah, I saw the Mets aren't doing nearly as well as last year.
No, not at all.
Bryce Harper's contract is ending soon, right?
Yes, it was supposed to end after this season, but they managed to sign him to one more year.
Oh, how much?
21.6 million. Quite a contract.
That is a ton of money.
Yeah, I hope he's worth it. Nats need to win a pennant while they have him, Scherzer, and Strasburg.
Yeah, they've got quite a bit of talent, it'd be a shame not to capitalize now.
The team is in great shape, I think they can compete. The Cubs look good too though.
Yeah, making the postseason is just the first step. Think they can make it to the World Series?
Well, I was worried about the Cubs after last season, but they seem to be underperforming so far.
Yeah, maybe they'll make it.
I hope so!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who is your favorite team?
Milwaukee Brewers
How do you think they will do this year?
I would be excited if they played 500 baseball.
How are they doing so far this year?
Four games above 500.
When did they last win.
Today, they beat the Mets 11-9
Were they ahead all the way.
No, they were behind 8-1 at one time.
How did they come back.
Basically, hits and long balls.
What inning did they score the most runs.
8th inning.
How many runs did they score in the 8th.
They scored 5 runs.
How did they do it?
Two base hits, a walk and a couple home runs.
Sounds like they have a good hitting team.
They do. There are scoring more runs then any other team in baseball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Braves game last night?  It went extra innings.
Yeah, I held out until the 11th inning and then had to go to bed.
Do you think the Royal have a strong bullpen this year?
I don't know.  It seems like they traded a lot of pitchers at the end of last season.
What do you think of that call on 2nd in the 9th inning?
He looked safe to me.  They challenged it and lost.
Can you believe that hothead Ryan charged to mound after getting hit by the ball?
Yeah, they need to send that clown back to the minors.
I bought tickets to the Cubs game.  I'm bringing my son and his ball glove.
Ya, never know.  Plenty of foul balls to be had.
Did you see the Indians and Padres game.  It was a high scorer.
Yeah, it looked more like a football score.
What did you think of the homeplate umpire in the Yankees game last night?
I think he's the best money can buy.  He didn't make a good call all night.
Are you going to watch the Red Socks vs. Yankees game this weekend?
Wouldn't think of missing it.  I never miss that matchup.
Did you watch the end of the Royals double-header?
Yeah, the GM got doused with a cooler of Gatorade.
Did you hear they traded Rodriguez for Chavez?
Yeah, we got the bad end of that deal.  Millions down the drain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to a live major league baseball game?
No, I think baseball is so boring.
I bet you wouldn't think it was so boring if you saw a game in person.
Why do you say that?
At a live baseball game, you're more engaged, it's more exciting.
There are too many commercials in televised baseball games! It makes the games last a ridiculously long period of time.
That's why live major league baseball games are exciting: there aren't any commercial breaks.
What else do you think makes live baseball so much better?
There's sort of a sense of community. Even if you don't normally follow a team, it's fun to get caught up in rooting for one of the teams.
I have to admit that when the crowd is involved with cheers or doing the wave, it does look fun.
And you get to see the super-fans up close, the guys who paint their faces and dye their hair to match the teams' colors.
Do you think the players really notice that?
I do. I think the players draw on the energy of the crowd and the excitement of the fans.
It's a shame that major league games have become so expensive.
I know. It costs more for a family of 4 to go to a game, park, get hot dogs and sodas and maybe a ball cap or t-shirt,  than it cost me to attend a semester at college!
Going to a game can cost as much as a used car! It makes the experience out of reach for so many ordinary people. That may be why baseball has become less popular over the years.
Why do you think the games have become so expensive to attend?
I think it's because they pay the players so much more than they used to. Athletes are paid as much as rockstars, and the fans ultimately pay the price.
So do you think you'd like to go to a major league game sometime.
Sure, I just need to win the lottery first!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Pirate game yesterday?
Yeah, they finally scored some runs.
I didn't get to watch it because it was a day game but did see they won.
Yeah, at least they didn't get swept by the Nationals.
I read that Jung ho Kang lost his appeal on his dui sentence in Korea
Really?
Yeah, doesn't look like he will be rejoining the team anytime soon.
That sucks, but why would you put yourself in that situation?
Exactly, I think he is a bit of a reckless person.
Me too.
Remember last year when he was accused of raping someone in Cincinnati?  What was that?
I know, he is a good player but I am wondering how much more the Pirates can take before releasing him?
I know.
He just isn't making good decisions.
Seems like they are experiencing a lot of that.
I know.
What was Marte thinking using PEDs.
Cheater, no wonder he was so fast.
Not good examples but I am sure they are one of many in MLB
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I had to help out last night at the kids baseball practice.
Oh yeah, how did that go?
It was exhausting!
What?  Did you have to play with them?
Not really, but I was chasing balls and everything else!
Shouldn't the kids have chased the balls?
I thought they would have, but the coaches were trying to teach them how to properly throw and needed someone to shag the balls.
And that was you?
Yes.  And seven year old kids really can't throw.
Well, hopefully the practice helped.
Yeah, I'm hoping.  Their first game is next week.
Are the kids excited?
Oh, for sure.  But half of them really can't hit the ball.
Wow, have they ever played before?
Most of them have to an extent, but this is the first year in this league for most of them.
So they can't hit a pitched ball.
Exactly.  Next practice will be focusing on hitting I think.
Sounds like you guys need it.
Yeah.  I might take mine down to the batting cages.
That always worked for us growing up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
By far, the strangest thing that has happened in baseball in recent history was White Sox pitcher Chris Sales going nuts with the scissors.
Why, was he running with scissors?
No, seriously, he went nuts with a pari of scissors. It got him suspended.
How do you get suspended for a pair of scissors?
He was pissed off because he thought the White Sox were way too focused on selling jerseys and other merchandise.
Was he mad they weren't focusing on him?
Well, sort of. He thought they would care more about the players than they did the sale of merhcandise.
So what happened with the scissors?
He grabbed a pair and cut up a bunch of the throwback jerseys in the team's clubhouse.
You mean those jerseys displayed with great pride and highly valued?
Yes, pretty much. He cut them to pieces.
And how did that go over with the team?
He was suspended for 5 games.
Is there a specific rule about not cutting up jerseys that aren't yours?
No, but he destroyed team property or equipment, violated team rules, and was insubordinate.
Insubordination: that's code for "you pissed off the wrong people", isn't it?
Yes, pretty much.
Did they do anythng else to him.
Besides the suspension? No I don't guess so.
They should have given him a pair of those safety scissors with the round edges that can't cut anything.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see puege play last night?
No, what happened?
He had a homer in the 5th.
Nice, anyone on base?
Yeah, pederson.
Sweet, that dude is of the hook as well.
I know, the whole team is doing good.
Yup, they are fighting for first place.
With who, the giants?
No, the Rockies.
Didn't they just play a series with them?
Yeah, the Dodgers took 2 of 3.
Usually it's the giants that are batting, not the Rockies.
It's baseball, you never know.
Right is Dodgers and giants.
That's right, they are playing in San Francisco.
That should be good.
I know, two rivals.
I how no one gets hurt.
I know, good luck fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Reds-Giants game last night?
No, what happened?
It went 17 innings.
Who won?
The Giants. Posey hit a HR in the 17th to win it.
He was still in the game?
yeah, imagine playing 17 innings at catcher.
How long did it last
It must have been over 5 hours at least
That's the toughest position, and he played it for 5 hours.
There's no way he's playing today.
No way, they're giving him a day off.
How did Billy Hamilton look last night?
0 for 7.
That's not good. So no stolen bases?
No, none.
He hasn't had a stolen base in more than a week.
I know. He was on pace for 100+ this year.
He'll probably get injured before he can get close
Happens every year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Well, you?
Not bad.
Good.  You into baseball?
I like baseball, sure.
Yeah same here.
Ever been to a ball park?
I have once, when I was a kid.
Oh cool, which one?
Went to Camden Yards.
Is that where the Orioles play?
Yeah that's right.  What about you?
I have been a few times.
Where?
Turner field.
That the braves?
Yep.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Cubs are finally getting hot!
It's about time!
They are lucky that the other teams in the division were also struggling
Yeah. As of today, they are only 2 games out of first place
Exactly and they are playing the Brewers, so if they sweep them, they could be back in 1st place
Yeah, that would be great!
They have to much talent to continue to struggle.
I agree with you. This team is stacked.
Yeah it's time for the Cubs to dominate.
The hitting is really coming together
Yeah this offense should be dangerous
A lot of young studs in the lineup
Rizzo and Bryant alone are enough to scare anybody
I agree. Too much talent in this lineup
Over a 162 game season, the cream should rise to the top
Absolutely. They have plenty of time
Yeah, you just can't panic. Just gotta stay on the path.
The Cubs will be fine. They are the best team in baseball.
I agree, but watch those Yankees. They are back!
Yeah the Yankees are dangerous this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the good old days for my Atlanta Braves
Yeah it's been a long time since they have been competitive.
I mean they do have the best hitter in baseball, Freddie Freeman!
Yeah but Freeman just got hurt. He broke his wrist!
Are you serious! How long is he scheduled to be out?
They are saying 8 to 12 weeks.
Jeez, that's a long time. Well that sucks but it wasn't like the Braves were going anywhere this year.
I know but at least you could watch Freeman swing a bat, now there's no reason to watch this team.
I just keep waiting for this team to turn a corner and become elite again.
Yeah me too, but they have so many holes on this roster, I still think they are a long way away.
Yeah it's really sad to see how far they have fallen
As a kid, I used to watch this team play all of the time on the superstation.
Yeah me too, that's how I became a fan of this team.
Yeah but we are a long ways away from Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz.
Yeah those guys are not walking out of the bullpen any time soon.
Nope. They just built that new stadium, so maybe that will give the fans something to be excited about.
Maybe, but when my team isn't winning it doesn't matter where they are playing
Yeah being in constant rebuild mode is not a lot of fun
I miss the good old days of tomahawk chopping our way to another division title and World Series Appearance
Yeah, well don't hold your breath it could be a while
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Giants and Dodgers last night?
Yes.  It was a big game between rivals.
Yes, I always try to catch those big rivalry games.
The Giants won, right?
Yes.  I think they've won four straight games now.
Interesting.  They have not looked good for most of the season.
No they haven't.  But they started getting some players back from the DL.
I heard.  They got Crawford back, right?
Yes. He's a good player so that is important.
And Buster Posey is hitting home runs all of a sudden.
Yea, I saw something that said he hit just one home run in April and six already in May.
That's pretty amazing, he's not a guy known for huge power.
No, especially in that ballpark.  But he's off to a great season offensively.
He is a former MVP, so that is to be expected.
What do you think about the Dodgers so far this season?
Honestly I thought they would be just a bit better, but it's still early.
Do you think they are still the favorites in the NL West?
Yes.  The Rockies look good, but I think in the end the Dodgers will win.
What about the Giants?
No way.  They dug themselves too deep a hole already, in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you just a that?
No,I dropped my phone.
You missed it.
Missed what?
He just stole home.
What?
Keno just stole home.
Yes we are tied.
Two out bottom of 6th. Guts who's up?
Oral hershiser
Yes, yes. He could hit.
Did you see his last at bat.
Sure did.
He almost got hit.
My cable went out. It's back.
Did you see him avoid getting hit?
No.
You need better cable.
Come over.
Ok on my way
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Dodgers are going to do this year?
It's hard to say, I guess it depends on how many injuries they have.
Yeah, I know what you mean. For what, about four years now by the time they get to the play offs they're pretty beat up.
It's pretty discouraging, they win their division every year and then they fizzile in the play offs.
I know right, they kind of remind me of the Atlanta Braves in the 90's. They just couldn't quite win the big one.
They had a heck of a team back then though.
Yeah, with Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, that was quite a pitching staff.
It was. Smoltz was pretty unbelievable after he got injured and came back as a relief pitcher.
It was like he had two careers. I wonder if he'll make it to the hall of fame.
I dunno. There's a lot of good players who don't get into the hall.
I think it's all a lot of political B.S.
Could be. But as long as Barry Bonds doesn't get in, I'm good with that.
Yeah, he was just such an incredible jerk.
Not to mention the thing with the steroids.
Yeah, one year he was thin, and then the next year he shows up with an extra 30 pounds of muscle.
There is no way he wasn't taking steroids. Him and a lot of other players.
Look how long it took Piazza to get in to the hall, and he wasn't even suspected of using steroids.
Yep. Just because he played during that era, he was automatically assumed to be guilty.
I was really broken up when the Dodgers traded him. I think he got the royal shaft.
He did. The Dodgers can be jerks, and they can't win the World Series, and yet we root for them every year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of that bat flip?
Totally bush league.
Why do you think that?
It is one thing to get overly expressive when you are in a back and forth championship series and the tensions are high and you hit a dinger that sails; quite another when you are up 5 in the early part of the season.
I agree, he should act like he has been there before.
Did you see what the pitcher said?
No what did he say?
He said he was pimping it and that we have seen it from him enough.
How much you want to bet he gets hit by pitch in next three or four games?
He deserves it.  Most hated man in baseball.
Pitchers stick up for each other.  I bet he gets hit.
I believe it could happen, but it could cause problems.
Yeah, his team sticks up for him.
So maybe we will see some bench clearing in the next couple of weeks.
Maybe.  Or it could just die down.
Until he does it again.
He wouldn't!
I would not bet against it.  He's pretty unsportsman like.
Eventually some one will hit him in the mouth again.
Yeah, because he just won't stop.  He thinks it is part of the game even though no one else does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the Los Angeles game last night?
I went to bed early. Did I miss anything good?
Did you ever.
What happened?
They cleared the benches in Los Angeles.
What? Why?
Ross Stripling hit Stanton with a throw.
What? He's got some nerve to be doing that.
I 100% would have thrown at anyone other than Stanton, dude is  massive.
Tell me about it. He towers over everyone on the field.
I think he lost a lot of his nerve when he saw Stanton wasn't dropping his bat though.
I would too. Stanton is  6'6".
You should have seen Stanton stalking towards the mound with a bat. I would have been  terrifed.
Nah, I don't think so.
You don't think so? Dude, Stanton is huge!
I know. That's why I know you wouldn't be stupid enough to pick a fight with someone who nearly has a foot of height on you.
Definitely. My mother didn't raise and idiot.
Reminds me of when a young Porcello accidentally hit Youkilis and for no reason whatsoever Youk charged the mound and an incredibly confused, and skinny Porcello used all that weight moving in his direction to just throw Youk to the ground.
That's  one of my favorite charging the mound moments in baseball.
I'd be scared out of my mind if Stanton started walking towards me like that. I wouldn't know what to do except to either run or try to apologize.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the Cubs are starting to get a little too confident.  They got shut out again today.
It's only a matter of time before the bats start heating up.
I'm just worried that everyone is a bit too relaxed after the World Series win.  It's as if there's nothing to play for anymore.
Are you serious?
Yeah, I mean Javi Baez and Wilson Contreras are swinging at everything.
That's only two guys.
True, but Rizzo and Bryant aren't putting the ball in play very much either.  Tons of strikeouts.
I understand, I think it's just too early to judge.
And then there's the starting pitching problem.  Arrieta got destroyed last time out.
I'm afraid he might be on the decline.
Think he's getting a big contract cuz we shouldn't give it to him.
He'll probably find a suitor, but I think we got his best two years ago.
I agree.  Lester still can't throw to first base, huh?
Nope.  Absolutely incredible for such an elite pitcher.
It blows my mind every time I watch him.
You think he'd practice in the offseason or something.
I know, apparently the organization isn't too concerned.  I'm worried it will bite him one day.
I feel like it does one way or another in every start.
Good thing we have four other good starters.
That's for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe how well the Yankees are doing this year ?
I was not really following them.  I am a chicago cubs fan.  How are they doing?
Their record is 20 wins and 9 losses to today 5/8/17
Really, how are my chicago cubs doing in comparison?
Actually they have 16 wins and 15 losses.
have they played the Yankees recently?
Yes.  In fact they just ended a three game series against one another.
How did the two teams perform/
I am sorry to disppoint you but the Yankees won all three games
Really, were the game scores at least close?
Two of the games were very close in which the Yankees won by only one run.  But in one game the Yankees won by a score of 11-6
Really, were the Chicago Cubs ahead or behind in the games.
Well in the first game the Cubs were ahead 2-0  until the ninth inning.
What happened in the ninth inning?
There were two players on base.  The Yankee batter then hit a home run which made the score 3-2 in favor of the Yankees.
Did one of the new players Aaron Judge hit the home run?
No, in fact it was one of the older players Brett Gardner  that hit the home run.
Did anything else as interesting happen in the three game series?
Yes in the last game the teams were tied 3-3 in the Ninth inning and the game went into overtime.  The Yankees won but not until the 18th inning.
Wow, I am going to havef to start watching the Yankees games .
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Ken Burns' documentary about baseball?
Yes
I was surprised that Double day didn't actually invent it.
I was also. The thorough research impressed me.
Do you agree that the '27 Yankees are one of the best teams?
I wonder how they would do against the 2016 Cubs.
We'll never know. A lot of interesting detail about significant events in the evolution of baseball.
Yep. I learned about the Negro leagues and the women league, Curt flood's situation leading to free agency. A lot of stuff
I am thinking of buying it. A basball fan's dream.
What do you think overall of management's treatment of players.
For a long time, players were treated as a commodity, but that was wrong; the players did the actual work that fans paid to watch.
I agree. The owners have their rights, of course, but show dignity for the players.
I learned about A.J. Rawlings starting his company; now a well-known name in baseball.
Sure is. I enjoyed learning about baseball during World War 2. The palyers who fought and those who didn't make it back home.
Just like the country, baseball started out east and work its way west during its expansion., which seems to still be in progress.
The Cuban players sure have made their impact It's great that baseball integrated them.
Yep - the ol American melting pot
I liked learned about the stadiums of yesteryear, like Ebbets Filed and such
I also liked learning about the Dodgers team name origin.
Yeah, the Trolley Dodgers at first because fans had to watch out for traffics going to the stadium.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Derek Jeter night last night?
Yea, it was a nice service.
I think that Bryce Harper will win MVP this year.
Me too, he is playing really well.
I think Judge on the Yankees will win rookie of the year.
Me too, he is playing lights out.
I think that Pete Rose should be in the Hall of the Fame.
Me too, he is the hit king.
I think that Barry Bonds is the best outfielder of all time.
He was good, but he was a cheater.
I think that the Cubs are overrated this year.
I disagree, they won the world series last year.
The Yankees look really good this year.
Yea, they could do well this year.
I hope that the Blue jays improve.
I think they will, they have a good roster.
I think that the Red Sox are overachieving.
I disagree, they have a good team.
I think that the all-star game is waste of time.
I agree, it is boring and not that good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you recently viewed the NCAA Baseball Standings?
No, but last time I looked Mississippi State was ranked 11th.
Well, they are ranked 7th now, and TCU is ranked 6th.
I want to see Oregon State and Florida play, Oregon has a top pitching program, and Florida can really swing the bat.
Texas Tech has been a real turn out this year, getting help from the most unlikely of places.
I know, there line up is always full of surprises.
Did you see where Coach Casey of OSU got his 1,000th career win?
I did, against Oregon, for a moment there I thought Oregon was going to pull it out.
It is still unbelievable that Brent Rooker is hitting .885.
Yeah the pitching in college baseball is not as competitive at as the pros.
I guess not, because right behind that .885 average, Niko Hulszer is hitting .805 on the year.
I am sure the road Omaha is going to be a long journey for some teams.
There is always a major upset, I am curious to see who is going bust
It would not surprise me if LSU makes a late run and gets to Omaha this year.
That would surprise me.
What about Kentucky I know they have fallen in the polls, but all it takes is one good game to turn things around.
You know who has been out of the baseball talk for awhile, is Texas, back in the day they could really play some ball.
I Have not heard to much about them as of late, they are not even ranked in the top 25.
I guess it was time to pass the torch, and Texas Tech has taken full advantage.
This year will be interesting when regionals come to town.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will the Yankees ever be good again
I think very shortly
How good will they be?
They have one of the best farm systems in baseball
Do you think theyll ever go back to the old way of doing things?
Like signing overpriced free agents?
Yeah that way
No, I think baseball has changed
In what respect
Most teams hoard their talent
So you wont see them sign those guys
Those kind of guys arent hitting the market anymore
But what about a team that has a surplus at a position
You do have those but that will be in trades
Will their farm system ever run out?
Sure theyll trade those guys away
Interesting. I cant see them standing pat
Either can I, but theyll use it as a farm system
I bet Steinbrenner is rolling in his grave
Oh you know he is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see last night's baseball game between the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees?
Yeah, I cannot believe that Brad Brach blew another save.
The Yankees have owned him this season.
True, but did you see the homerun by Aaron Judge in the 14th inning to win it?
Ha, by then I was fast asleep.
I was exhausted but it was totally worth staying up for, he hit it in the black seats at the stadium.
Seriously?  Isn't he just the second one to do that?
Certainly is, Alex Rodriguez did it 5 years ago.
That Judge kid looks to be an amazing young talent.
Yeah, I like the young core that the Yankees have with Judge, Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius.
I really wasn't sure why the Yankees let Brian McCann go to Houston, but now I see why watching Sanchez.
Yeah, the 20 homeruns he hit last year are definitely no fluke.
I agree and Judge is already at 15 in his rookie season and we are only in May.
Wow, 15 already! I did not realize it was that many.
Yeah, and when he hits one it is long gone over the fence.
I know, his longest was around 460 feet this year.
Was that the longest homerun in the Major Leagues this year?
No, it was close but someone hit a ball farther in Miami.
Mike Stanton?
But of course :-)
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the baseball umpire getting cheered in Philadelphia?
What? Baseball umpires never get cheered. No matter what they do, they always make somebody mad!
Not this time! He became the hero of the game!
What happened?
This fan was yelling rude remarks at the Giants. I mean, really rude remarks, obscene remarks.
I hate it what some jerk makes you embarrassed that you brought your kid to the game!
Apparently this umpire hates it too.
What did he do?
He had the fan ejected from the game!
Wait, he had a fan ejected? I didn't even know they could do that!
Well he did. Security escorted the loud-mouthed jerk out.
That's awesome.
The whole crowd loved it. Everybody cheered on the umpire!
That has got to be a first in baseball!
I know, usually umpires are pretty much despised.
I hope he gets admitted to the umpire hall of fame.
I'm pretty sure there isn't an umpire hall of fame.
Well there should be one, just dedicated to this one guy.
What if it started a trend of people actually appreciating umpires and cheering them on for good call?
That would be just crazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How far is one base from the next?
A base is 90 feet away from the next one, 60 feet in little league baseball.
I've seen different baseball parks have different distances to the fences.
True, and that actually adds interesting strategy to the game of baseball.
Yeah, some parks have closer fences, relatively speaking, I've noticed.
True, and those parks favor hitters more, especially home run hitters.
So, the other parks, with the farther fences, favor the pitchers more, it sounds like.
Yes. Teams that play in those "pitchers parks" will structure their team differently than the other teams.
Sounds like baseball is more than just a game of hitting, throwing and running.
Certainly more so. There are many analytics and different strategies that can be and are used.
So a player who hits more home runs will be treated differently by the other team than a player who runs fast.
Indeed, because you have to defend against the player's strengths as much as possible.
So, would it pay to know about the other team and its players?
Most certainly it would, but teams try to hide some information about their strategy to keep their opponents guessing.
Yes, and that's why you'll see coaches perform hand signals that hopefully only their players know.
I've seen catchers give signs with their fingers to the pitcher.
Yes, so the pitcher will know what type of pitch to throw.
Can an opposing player steal signs?
They can, if that player can see them and he has figured out their meaning.
I've seen catchers try to hide their signs for that reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey are you here I am at Wrigley field?
Shame I won't be making it to the game today.
Awww you won't?
Nah I can't my boss will not let me off early
Are you gonna be able to catch the game at all?
Yeah I will try to watch it in the office
Your boss won't mind that?
Sure he won't as he always does.
Bave a good time and let's talk about the players while we wait.
Rodgers is who is on my mind he is awful its like he cannot hit anything five feet in front of eyes.
I know right? Its like he is a bat or something
I think a bat would be giving him to much credit.
You see carter stats though?
They are almost high enough he will beat the records from like the 50s.
The records are that old geeze.
Most of the new players are nowhere near as good as the old ones.
I would not go quite as far as that some of them are quite good.
But they are not as good precisely.
Let's agree to disagree but I gotta go the games about to start
Well have a good one hopefully I see you on the tube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch baseball
I love baseball
Do you do fantasy
I'm into it but not yet
It's tough
Fantasy?
Yeah it can be really hard
What's hard about it?
You have to watch the statistics
For teams or players?
Both really.
Yeah that seems tedious.
Man, Mookie Betts is having a good year though.
Mookie Betts huh?
Yeah, he's my first pick.
He's on Boston?
Yeah Boston.
I never pay attention to Boston
Well yeah that's why I do fantasy
So you can watch other players right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch baseball often?
Yes, it is one of my favorite sports to watch.
How many games have you been to?
I try to go to a couple games each season.  I love to watch the Pirates play.
Is that your favorite team?
Yes.  What's yours?
I love the Red Sox.
That's a great team as well.
Do you ever get the chance to play?
Sometimes, I get together with a few friends and we play.
My kids are on a local team.
Do you get involved as well?
A good bit.  I help coach and play umpire once in a while.
That's awesome that you are involved with your kids in their games.
Yes, they just love to play baseball.
Do you ever take them to see any games?
When school is out, I try to get them to at least one over the summer.
I love going to see games.  The stadiums are huge!
Yes.  I am also amazed by the different food options served during the games.
They have everything to choose from when at baseball games.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
What's up?
Not much, you?
Same.  You into baseball?
Yeah I like baseball.
Did you ever play?
No never played.  You?
Yeah I played a little bit.
Oh interesting.  What level did you play at college?
No never made it that far.
No?
Only went up to high school.
Were you any good?
I was okay.
What position did you play?
I was catcher.
Oh cool.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am interested in getting into baseball.
That is good baseball is a great sport and past time.
Where should i start i am confused.
To start just read up the rules online but here is a quick rundown.
Ok lay it on me.
Points are scored by homerunning the ball and running around the bases.
Seems simple enough to me then.
That is not all their is a little more to it.
What more is their to it?
If someone in the outfield catches the ball then the runner must stop is the next thing.
Is their anything more to the game.
When the batter is batting he has three chances if he misses that means he is out.
That seems rather forgiving to get three chances.
It is  but the game is fun for that to be able to try.
What stations can i watch games on?
They play lots of games on the local channels and you can watch some online.
That sounds great what site do you use to keep track of the players though?
Just check out ESPN they got the source for everything.
Wow thanks their is alot here it is almost overwhelming
One day that will be simple just read up on things and watch the games you will make heads of it in no time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ask some questions to a baseball guru!
Avasail Garcia, buy or sell?
Sell. High BABIP suggests it's good luck.
Should White Sox trade Robertson? What could they get?
He'd be in demand, but I think the Sox would need to eat some money to get anything of real good value.
Freddie Freeman's injury bad or not big deal?
Out for 10 weeks so that's not good. If he makes it through rehab without complications he should return to form.
When do you think major trades start happening?
I'd guess first week of June, thereabouts.
Brewers for real or do they fall back to earth?
Good one. That's still tough to tell, I'd guess they don't win the central but could still be in the WC mix.
Can the Angels make a run and win their division?
Houston looks to be running away, so the Angels can battle around for Wildcard as well. I'd think Texas has a better shot, though.
You think the Rangers are still in it? I'm hearing people talk about the moving Darvish already.
People talk, but Beltre is coming back and they can easily hang around.
SO you don't think they move Darvish?
Only if they drop out of contention for sure and I don't expect that to happen.
Doug Fister signed with the Angels can he get back into old form?
Fister? I hardly knew her. Haven't seen him in a while so lets see him throw some minor league innings first.
LOL good point
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Ngoepe ?
You mean the first black African to play in the Major Leagues?
Yes, I did.
What do you think?
Well as the industry struggles with declining participation by black Americans, I think it could go either way.
Some are saying having a Black African playing professional baseball is the pinnacle of achievement in baseball for the people of that race.
I guess you can say that.
It’s really an unspoken thing.
Let's wait and see how he does and how he is treated.
As a baby, in the waning days of apartheid, Ngoepe lived in a hut in Limpopo, the northernmost province in South Africa.
Needing a way to provide for her sons, Maureen left the children with her parents and found work cleaning houses.
He has come a long way. I am sure of it but this is a whole different situation.
He is in the Major Leagues now.
Yeah. Life as he once knew it is over.
He has a tattoo of Africa on his left shoulder, and I think he already knows life will be different when he returns home.
You know he  scored a run against the Cincinnati Reds after a wild pitch on Tuesday?
No, I didn't. I have been a little too busy lately to keep up with baseball.
One of his teammates hugged him after he hit a single off the Chicago Cubs’ Jon Lester late last month.
I saw that game. That was Kimera Bartee who hugged him.
I think he will be alright for the sport.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is an acceptable batting average?
I think that question is hard to answer.
How so?
There are a bunch of mitigating factors.
Like what?
How good is the hitter? Is he a power hitter? Contact hitter?
Ok lets start with the power hitter.
Alright since they tend to make contact that is productive I would say .270
And how about for contact hitters?
Acceptable would be .310
Those are some pretty lofty goals.
Well singles hitters need to spray the ball more and they usually do.
And power hitters?
They make more long outs so thats why I would dip them below .300
I just think .310 is too high for an acceptable rate, that would lead the league sometimes
No, I think .350 and above should be a league leader.
How about for a power hitter who leads the league in batting
If that were the case I would say .320.
Its hard to judge based just on batting average I guess
Thats where I Was going
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the game between the Braves and Blue Jays the other night?
Are you talking about the one where they almost started fighting?
Yes.  The Jose Bautista bat flip.
I did not see the entire game, but I watched the highlights.
What do you think about this whole bat flipping thing?
I guess it kind of depends on the circumstances.
So when do you think bat flipping is okay?
Well I don't mind it as much when it's a big moment, like a walk off home run.
Yea, but this game the Blue Jays were losing and Bautista just did it for show.
I agree, that's the impression I got.  That he was doing it more to show up the Braves than to actually celebrate.
You remember Bautista got in a fight because of all this stuff last year.
Yea, with Odor.  That did not turn out well for him.
Yes, I think some Braves players were saying Bautista shouldn't want to fight after that.
Yes, that was kind of funny.  But you know what, Bautista can't be afraid of anything either.
Well anyways, last night Bautista got hit on the thigh with a pitch, and that was that.
Yea, probably justified.  I don't mind those pitches too much as long as you don't go after a player's head.
And you know Bautista is not going to stop flipping bats.
No way.  There's almost pressure on him to flip his bat now.
That's true.  If he doesn't it almost seems like he is giving in to public pressure.
Exactly.  And you know, he can keep doing it as long as the situation warrants it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Red Sox and the Indians?
I saw Ortiz strike out in the 6th innning.
Did you see the rest of the game?
No, I turned off the television. What happened during the seventh inning?
Lindor had a base hit and that allowed Kipnis to score.
What was the score?
The Indians led the Sox 4-0?
What happened during the eighth inning?
Kluber almost pitched a no-hitter the whole night.
Why did he not pitch the whole night?
His shoulder was in pain and that led him to give a hit to Young.
Did the Red Sox get any runs in the game?
Yes, Young scored after Ramirez hit a triple into center field.
Was it out of the reach of Lindor?
Yes, it was almost a home run.
What happened during the ninth inning?
Kipnis hit a fastball off of Barnes and it went into right field. This allowed Encarnacion to score.
What was the last score?
It was 5-1. The Indians won the game.
That was a good ending to the game. The Indians have a great roster this year!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You see the standings in the AL East?
No, I didn't what do they look like?
Well, Baltimore is at the top right now, kinda shocking.
That really is, where's the big hitters, the Sox and Yankees?
Well the Yankees are only half a game back of the O's, so they really are doing well.
How about the sox? they're my friends favorite team
well, at least they aren't your favorite team, they aren't doing so hot
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever play baseball?  I did for one season in Babe Ruth ball.
Sure I was on little league through high school.  I was a decent outfielder and could hit pretty well at that level.
I kind of stunk.  Rode the bench and worked the concession stand mostly, Don't know how I got on the team.
No fun sitting on splinters all season.  I always felt for the bench riders.
At first i started out pretty well and tried for first base.  I got so i could field and throw well in the infield,
Well that's a good feeling I liked to throw too and had a pretty good arm. I could throw home from the wall if need be.
I guess the regular first baseman didn't like any competition.  He had about 50 pounds on me and during infield practice he was up and hit to third.  I stretched towards third to try to catch it and get him out and he instead ran right into my left side full steam rather than the base.
Ouch, that must have hurt.  What happened?
Nobody called him on it i guess they did not notice. I think he broke a rib or two and really damaged my left shoulder.
What happened to it?  That could be pretty serious.
I tried to be brave and sluff it off.  But after that I could not throw at all and had to throw underhanded.
That must have put the end to your try to play some at first.  Kids can be pretty mean sometimes.
Yeah, I guess today they can fix things like that, the rotator cuff is common repair but not back in those days.  I was done in.
What happened then?  Did you quit?
I was the bench rider and the coach let me run the concession stand and suit up.  He let me bat one time trying to give me a chance.
Did you get a hit? Did you get on?
Well I drew a walk so that was better than nothing.  The next batter popped up and it was caught and I was picked off.  What a bummer.
Well at least you got to bat one time.  Did you like being on the team?
Actually yes but i was not a very confident athlete so I just went out for track the next season and could run pretty well.  Ha Ha.  Didn't have to worry about hitting the ball or being run over by one of the biggest kids in school any more.
I was lucky as I was a pretty good natural athlete and was encouraged to play ball from an early age.  I had a pretty good career and kept my high school yearbook as there are a couple of pictures with me in action.  Baseball has so many good memories I just love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long have you been a fan?
My whole life.
Me too.
Do you remember you're first game?
No.
I remember mine.
Who was it with?
Your boyfriend.
Really?
Yeah, we had such a great time.
That's cool.He really loves baseball.
We should all go to the baat and watch a game.
I'm game of your guys are.
Is there a game tonight?
Dude, it's summer time. There's a game every night.
Your right.
We could go to a game of you boys want?
Let's stay home.
That's fine with me.
Awesome then.see you at 6.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think about the Cubs this year?
I am not a Chicago fan, so I haven't been following them too closely.
They haven't been doing that good.
That is surprising, considering they are coming off a World Series win.
I know, I thought they would be doing better.
What is their record?
They are at 21 and 19 right now.
Wow, that is not bad...but not great.
I think the problem is really in their pitching.
How are they doing in that category?
Well, their overall team ERA is under 4.00, but a few of their key starters are struggling?
Yeah, that hurts if they can't get good starts out of these guys.
For example, Lackey is over 4.2 and Arrieta is over 5.00!
Ouch, how is Lester doing this year?
Much better, his ERA is under 4.
Good, but they need a team effort to be competitive this year.
I know, especially since the Brewers are on fire.
I did not expect that team to be doing so good.
The Cubs are going to have to step it up as summer approaches.
Maybe they can make some trades that would help them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What time are our tickets for the Dodger game?
1pm at Chaves Ravine!
Awesome!  Who do you think was the best Dodger manager of all time?
Oh! No question, Lasorda.
I agree.  Shall we take our seats in the stadium?
Sure.  Wow!  I always forget how big the field looks from the cheap seats.
(After the game has stated) Wow!  A 91mph pitch?  That's crazy!  He's going to pitch a no hitter.
Na!  His arm gives out near the sixth inning. Here comes Gwynn.  He always gets a piece of the ball.
STRIKE!  You were saying?
Just wait.  He'll get a piece of it and it'll get him on base if not get the Dodgers a run.
(Ball is hit)  Oh, that's going over the fence!
YES!!  That's 2 RBIs and a Home Run!
How far do you think he hit the ball?
It looks like it went over the right field fence, about ten feet in from the foul pole.
That was a thing of beauty.  Who's on deck?
Sosa.  If they keep playing like this, the Phillies might as well go home.
Do you think he can leg out a triple?
I don't know.  He's a hitter, not a runner.
OH! I gotta' give it o Philadelpia - that was a great catch by the center fielder.
Man! I bet his hand stings after catching that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to play the baseball game on the radio.
That's fine. Go ahead.
Do you listen to the games?
Not usually but I will today.
Do you like baseball?
I don't really have an opinion. I played when I was a kid, though.
I didn't know that.
It was in elementary school.
Were you any good?
I was a deent batter.
Ever hit a home run?
Once. It felt awesome.
I bet it did.
Have you ever hit one?
Not ever. I don't play.
Did you ever?
Not really.
That's too bad. It seems like something you'd like.
I'm sure I would.
They have a local team. You should try out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the season is going so far?
Good, everyone is playing about where I thought they would.
Are you surprised about the Cubs being so bad?
I dont think they are bad, just going through the pains.
Its hard to repeat.
It is, but I can see them heating up when you need them to.
They are still a well coached team.
And they have decent pitching.
Did you think the Mets would be this bad?
No not at all
Cespedes looks like hes getting old.
And David Wright is no longer a player.
Yeah, couple that with Familia being bad.
Well he isnt bad hes hurt.
That too.
They just dont have timley hitting.
Or getting decent pitching.
Thats the most shocking I think.
Syndergaard really hurt him
Thats the teams fault though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow baseball
only a little
Did you see the World Series last year?
Just the final game
Who is your favorite team
The Rockies
Oh, they've really struggled
Yeah, I used to cheer for the Reds when I lived in Cincinatti
Who was your favorite Reds player
Of all time it would be johnny bench
Not Pete Rose?
I like Charlie Hustle but he's still tainted I suppose
Kind of like Bonds
Yep, still one of the great pure hitters
I never saw him play but my dad did
My dad was a big New York Yankees fan back in the day
Too bad the Dodgers left
Yes, that was some rivalry
You don't get those kinds of rivalries these days
No, it's all professional
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game last night Between the Astros and cubs?
Yeah,I did but not the end.
Did you catch the second inning?
Oh yeah, that was an awesome play.
I've never seen someone jump into the crowd and go up 3 rows to catch a foul ball.
I have.
When ?
When I played baseball in the minors.
Who did it?
I did.
You lie.
I am. Johnson really knew where he was going. That saved the inning.
The cubs had bases loaded.
A grounder spoils of opened the game.
Did you see how it ended?
No,I had to use the restroom.
It ended with a grand slam.
By Jones?
No, Sanchez hit this one.
Sweet,I missed it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cardinals game?
Yeah Matheny is a great coach?
I can't believe he took out Molina for a switch hitter
I was surprised too till he hit that homerun
Yes walk off homeruns are the best
Bet Pujols is wishing he stayed in St Louis now
Is your son still playing baseball
Yes he plays shortstop
Aww shortstop, has he tried second base?
Yes, but he prefers short stop
What about pitching
He's not a very good pitcher.
I thought he had a good fastball
Yes he does but his curve ball is weak
Did you try pitching lesdons
Yes but his heart wasn't in it
Oh, I loved playing catcher
I was more of a left fielder.  I could throw out a runner at home plate with my srm
Hey you want to see the cards vs cubs game this weekend
Watch the cards beat the cubs? Of course I do
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Dodgers game last night?
Yeah, it was pretty good.
It's nice to see Puig producing.
I had a feeling he would. He's finally getting serious.
He has another year left on his contract too.
He needs to realize that he can make some serious money if he gets his act together.
Well, if he does then all the better for the Dodgers right now.
His contract is pretty team friendly right now. Only 6 million a year.
That's why they were willing to put up will all his nonsense. He has value.
Did you see Turner get hurt?
Yeah, hopefully it's not too bad.
At least they have a lot of depth to sort it out.
Yeah, there's a bunch of good players that are stuck in AAA because of it.
They'll just keep rotating guys up and down from the big club.
Just like they did last year with the pitchers.
Yeah, they didn't care if they were great or not. As long as they ate up innings,
Well, it kind of worked out for them last  year.
Yeah, they had a lot of pitchers hurt and just filled in the gaps with guys up for one start and then back down.
Either way, management seems to have things under control.
Yeah, they've planned well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
What's going on?
Not much, how are you?
doing okay.  You a baseball fan?
Yeah I'm a big fan.  You?
Yeah I love baseball.
Who do you like?
I'm a White Sox fan.
Oh I see, Chicago huh.
Yeah that's where I grew up.
Must have been tough with the Cubbies winning the world series last year.
Yeah it was rough, but it was cool for the city.
I see what you mean.
It was also good for baseball.
That was the first series I've watched in a long time.
Yeah exactly.
I'm a Marlins fan myself.
Oh okay.
Nice talking with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man the Cubs are really struggling this year.
Yeah, I know it's like they have a hangover from last year.
But can you really blame them? I mean they finally won the World Series
True. And they will probably get a pass for the next 100 years.
You are probably right, but with that being said, they should be winning.
With all of the young studs on this roster, you would think they would get it together.
Yeah, but their starting pitching has to better.
No doubt about it. Their starting pitching is holding them back
Guys need to forget about last year and focus on the present
Why not focus and try to win a championship in back to back years
That would be phenomenal and the city of Chicago would go crazy!
True, but probably not as crazy as last year.
True. Those Cubbie fans were outrages last year.
But hey they deserved it. They came back from a 3-1 whole to win it all.
Yeah what an epic comeback agains the Indians
Now their city hasn't won a world series in like forever
Exactly. But I think there time has passed. The Yankees are the team to beat this year
Yeah looks like the Yankees have re-tooled.
That franchise doesn't stay down for long
You're right about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's chat about old baseball history.  To way back in the day starting in the dead ball era.
Cool.  I read about many of those guys and remember seeing quite a few grainy films of them playing.
Back then in the early twentieth century If you hit 10 home runs that was awesome.  They seemed to play more for strategy and stealing bases.
Plus the ball was not lively like today.  The ball was wrapped much looser and could not travel as far when hit.
It didn't fly off of the end of the bat like they do now, to hit it over the fence took incredible power and many homers were inside the park ones.
Those guys could really run and hit, there were higher batting averages then too.  They really played as a team to win, double steals, hit and run, bunting.
Then the Bambino came and tore up the league with his power hitting and he was an awesome pitcher as well.  Quite a sensation he was.
Yeah, Boston was mad that he was sold to the Yankees.  Around then the ball was wrapped tighter and began to fly off of the bat.
Sure, the owners realized that fans liked the home runs and they wanted to please to get more fans in the seats.  Then the money came rolling in.
After a few years they started the hall of fame and later the color barrier was let down with the entry of Jackie Robinson.  Before then they had the old Negro leagues and had many awesome players that never came to the majore
Sometimes they would play the majors in exhibition games.  The Negro League teams usually did very well in them.
Many great players never played in the majors due to the color barrier and racism.  It was nice that the Hall of Fame devoted a wing to the old Negro Leagues and some of the great players from that era.
Who was the last batter to hit over .400?  The averages seem to have gone down as the homers increased.
That would be Ted Williams in 1941.  He was up there on the all time home run list about 521.  He had a high average for his lifetime too,
Yeah, he homered in his last at bat at age 42.  He sure went out with a bang and hit about .320 even at that age.
He was a remarkable player who went his own way.  Spent 5 years in the military in two wars.  Fighter pilot.  I guess he was a real life Superman if there ever was one!
Sure thing, its impossible to say who the greatest player ever is.  He would certainly be one of them.
Baseball has a remarkable history and surely was/is a national pastime.  It's hard to figure the salaries.  Now big stars get over 20 million a season with many perks.
Sure, guys like Mickey Mantle, for example made about 100,000 per year tops.  Even though it was years ago it is just hard to figure out.  Were the owners making that much back then?
That's a complicated issue.  I just liked seeing guys like Ty Cobb sliding hard into base.  Most of the players today aren't so aggressive.  Don't want to get hurt.  The old timers sure were a tough group.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go to the Mets game tomorrow?
Who are they playing?
The Yankees. It's supposed to be a good game!
Sure sounds like it. It will be the battle of New York.
You should definitely come. It's bound to be a good game, especially after the way the Mets played last night.
Who did they play?
The White Sox. It went into 13 innings.
I saw something about that on Sports Center this morning. The game sounded incredible.
It was. The White Sox won the game in the bottom of the thirteenth with a grand slam.
Did Wheeler start at the pitcher's mound again?
Yes. He's really turning into quite the pitcher.
I agree. He's got quite an arm.
So you'll come to the game tomorrow?
Of course. The Mets are going to be coming in with a lot of energy after that game last night.
Very true! I have tickets for behind third base.
Perfect. Have you always been a Mets fan?
No, believe it or not, I actually used to be a Marlins fan.
Why did you switch teams?
I moved up here to New York.
Oh gotcha. See you tonight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that steroids in baseball were the greatest thing to happen.
What, wait? Why?
Well, there were a ton of home runs, all mammoth.
You think home runs are the best play in baseball?
Of course! No one wants to watch a 1-0 strikeout fest.
Well, some old people do. But they're old, so what do they know?
That was unnecessary. Anyway, they also got attendance to skyrocket.
Yeah, I've noticed that too, and that it's gone down since steroids were made illegal.
People like seeing home runs, and catching them. They love the home run derby.
True. But what about them being role models?
They aren't role models unless they declare themselves to be.
But kids will blindly follow people they look up to.
That's a result of bad parenting. It's their job to say "Don't take steroids."
You've clearly never been a parent.
That's ... apparent, ha! So what do you think should happen to those who use steroids in MLB?
They should be suspended.
Why, it's their bodies! They can do what they want.
Because it gives them a CLEAR advantage that others cannot have.
Yeah, but they shouldn't be illegal in the first place.
We'll have to disagree on this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Boy I really disappointed in the Toronto Bluejays!
You know, I think I'm going to just give up on that team
I agree. Every year I think that this is the season where they put it all together and I'm always wrong!
It's like watching Charlie Brown trying to kick the football when Lucy is holding it!
Exactly! I can't keep falling for this team time and time again.
It's like they have so many problems. Sometimes they hit well, but their pitching is atrocious. They pitch well, but can't hit!
This team is so lost! I think they need to blow this squad up and start over
The culture in this organization is so bad right now. It's time for a change.
It may be necessary to get rid of the GM and the manager. Just to shake things up!
Yeah it's time. This organization needs a makeover.
Starting with Jose Batista. Ever since he had that big Home run year, he's been declining.
If he's not hitting a home run, he is worthless!
This guy has no plate discipline whatsoever.
I swear he goes up to the plate and all he seems to care about is trying to hit a home run.
Then surprise! He strikes out again!
Yeah, it would be a miracle if he got that batting average over 200
He's definitely not Tony Gwynn at the plate!
I would even take him being a serviceable hitter. He's not even a major league quality hitter right now
Yeah, but it's not all on him either. His teammates have not been stepping up as well.
Your're right! It feels like this hole team has been infected with a loser's mentality.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Boston's doing awful this year.
They're abysmal with fielding.
They're great at hitting and nothing else.
They're going to get creamed.
They're already getting creamed.
Yeah, but harder.
They're going to get wrecked hard by a semi decent team.
They shouldn't be losing
They'll keep losing regardless.
They love to lose.
I wish I could have pride in them.
We all do.
I wish I could be a prideful Bostonian.
They're like the least terrible thing about Boston.
Cruel.
Real.
Boston is pretty okay.
Boston is a horror and the team reflects that.
They're boring but they're not bad.
They abysmal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the old Los Angeles Coach?
No! Which One?
Hall of famer Tom Lasorda!
No what happened?
They said he's been hospitalized.
For What?
The club didn't provide any details. It just said that he's restin comfortably.
I wonder what happened.
I think maybe its his age.
How old is he?
Old man Lasorda is 89 years old.
He did a lot for the Dodger's organization.
Yeah! he spent over seven decades with them.
He has been a pitcher, coach and manager for the Dodgers, and guided them to their last World Series championship in 1988.
I hope everything will be fine.
Yeah, I know. But old age catches up to you.
Lasorda makes numerous appearances on behalf of the Dodgers.
He is a staple in that organization.
I might go watch some old Dodger's tapes.
I think I might just join you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Marlins game?
Yes! They lost again!
The Dodgers are very good, but the Marlines are pretty bad
They've lost over 15 games !
18 to be exact. !
Out of how many games?
22
And it's only May! Do you think they will get better?
We'll they better hope they can't get worse!
are they the worst in the MLB?
I think so, and I rEad that in 1998 the Marlins actually did worse!
Well that's Florida for you.
Living in Los Angeles do you love the Dodgers?
Ugh not really I don't see what's so great about them
Even Clayton Keyshawn!?
Especially KERSHAW
He needs a haircut
MLB should ban long hair
Does long hair get in the way of baseball?
Yes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Steve, you seem to know a lot about baseball. Care to see how much you know?
What do you have in mind, Carl?
I want to test your knowledge of baseball.
Fine. Go ahead.
In the National League in the 1890s many seasons had 12 teams. Which team was boycotted by the other 11 teams, who refused to play games in that team's home ballpark?
The Cleveland Spiders. They were a pretty good team, too.
How did you know that?
Lucky guess. Next question.
Which National League manager was the first to win four World Series?
Walter Alston
That one was too easy.
Give me another one.
Okay.  Which National League umpire died of a heart attack on Opening Day in 1997?
I think that was John McSherry. He was the home plate umpire on Opening Day on April 1st in a game with the Reds hosting the Expos.
Who was the first player in baseball history to hit more than 25 home runs in a season?
That would be Ned Williamson, who played for the Chicago White Stockings in 1884. His 27 home runs, along with his team's 142 total home runs was a fluke.
Man. How do you know all of this?
My dad gave me a book on baseball trivia when I was ten. I have been studying it for nearly 10 years now.
You cheater! No wonder you know so much about baseball.
I didn't cheat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the players wearing pink this weekend?
It looks stupid to be honest.
I could see them using pink bats and thats it
Yeah that seems better, some of these uniforms look terrible.
How come they never do anything for Father's Day?
No idea, very strange.
I think alot of the parks are going to be geared towards mothers day today.
Yeah they will, alot of pink bats.
Its good to raise awareness
For what?
I believe its breast cancer.
Baseball pays homage to alot of causes.
Yeah its good to see that sort of philanthropic sense in the game.
Do you think we see advertisements on jerseys ever?
No they have enough room in the park
I agree, I just dont know how OK with it they are.
I think you will see some sort of bizarre advertising, maybe on the bats.
You can barely see them when theyre being swung.
I know but theyll capitalize on something.
Each pitch will be brought to you by a different sponsor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Detroit Tigers bullpen?
Ugh! It has been their downfall for years!
Did you see the game last night? I really did feel bad for Sanchez.
He sure has lost it, hasn't he? Same as K-Rod, it seems.
I feel bad for him, too, but just dreaded each time I saw him warming up in the bullpen.
I know exactly what you mean. How do you think Justin Wilson will do as the closer?
He sure can't do any worse than K-Rod was doing. He was able to do the job the other night against Arizona.
Yeah, he did a good job. Did you hear that interview they had with him following the game?
You mean when they asked him about being nervous when he had to come in and pitch the ninth?
Yeah, and he said he was more nervous than usual. That was funny. He also gave credit to the other relief pitchers for that night.
I know. There were sure a couple of deep fly balls given up by both Hardy and Greene.
True, but they ultimately got Arizona out without them scoring. So, you can't complain too much.
Yeah, you're right. What did you think of Verlander that night?
It just seems like he's been kind of struggling this whole season. He's been winning okay, though.
His velocity has sure been good. One of his strikeout pitches was 99 mph!
I know. I heard he reached a hundred a few games ago.
Yeah, he did. But it doesn't seem like his control has been there like it has been in the past.
Well, Michael Fulmer's control has sure been there!
What a pitcher! I heard him compared to a young Verlander!
He is certainly everything they said he was going to be! He's definitely had an impact on the pitching staff!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Bill?
Yes Dad?
Hold your popcorn...  You know my dad used to take me to the game all the time when I was your age?
Wow were you a Dodgers fan too?
I was a fan of the ballpark how it smelled, fresh dodger dog..the smell of peanuts..just so exciting.
I'm having a great time dad.
And just when I was your age was when the miracle happened...I caught my very first fly ball.
Wow all by yourself?
Yeah...with that same glove I gave you. (looks down at the glove he gave to billy last year for t-ball).
Wow  I'm hoping that some day happens to me.
It was kind of strange thinking back on it though...  after I got that fly ball I felt like part of the reason I came to the ballpark was complete.
Oh?
Yeah it was like my dad built it up so much that I felt like there would never be topping that day no matter how many times we went, so we quit going.
Here dad have some of my popcorn *both smile*
Announcer *Next up to batter up is Holiday*
Wow look dad he's up!
Wow look son its coming right for us!
Billy catches the ball*  Wow dad I.... *looks over at his dad then drops it on the ground as another little girl near him gobbles it up*
*Dad smiles*  Aww son...oh well there will always be a next time!
Yeah dad, guess we'll have to just keep coming back til I finally get one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like baseball?
Yes, love it!
Do you have a favorite team?
I live in Colorado, so it's the Colorado Rockies all the way!
How are they doing this year?
Not too bad, but probably not good enough to make the playoffs
Do you watch them on TV, or go to the games in person?
A little of both, plus some radio as well.
Where is their stadium?
It's in downtown Denver.
Is it hard to get to?
No, great parking and close to light rail, too!
Isn't it expensive to ride light rail to the ballgame?
No, not if you are a senior citizen!
How many games do you go to each year?
Maybe 6 or so, depending on how well they are doing.
Are you a fair weather fan - you don't go if they are losing?
My husband is, but I just love to go sit in the stadium on nice days and people watch!
Have you ever gone to a baseball game by yourself?
No, but I think it would be fun, so I'll try it sometime!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Whats happening?
Not much you?
Not much.  you into baseball?
Yeah I really like baseball.
Ever been to a game?
Yeah loads of them.
Is it a lot of fun?
Yeah I have a great time.
That sounds nice.
You ever been?
No, but I want to.
You really should.  Great place to take your family.
I've thought about doing it quite a bit.
If you have a local team near you  you should go.
We do have a farm team about 20 minutes from here.
Go check them out you won't regret it.
Thanks I will.
Great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are the Braves doing?
They are a tough team to judge.
I thought they were rebuilding but some of their signings dont say so.
Yeah guys like Dickey and Colon dont signal that.
Exactly. And Kemp.
He was a good player once.
Yeah a while ago.
They just need bodies.
Then they signed Ryan Howard.
Freeman bats left so I dont get that one either.
Every time I think they are building for the future they sign an old guy.
They need a reason to go to the park
No one wants to see RA Dickey pitch anymore.
Well that could be true but rotations need veteran leaders
So what? Lose alot get a better pick those kids will learn
Maybe the idea is to trade them for a better arm
They could do that but I dont think he  gets you a good return
Sure he does if he has a good year
Hasnt pitched well in 9 years
Thats not true I think he was a Cy Young candidate a few years ago
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Dodger game last night?
Oh yeah. Kershaw was pitching. I never miss the game when he pitches.
I know. I feel the same way. But I thought he looked off last night.
I didn't. Why do you say that? They won.
I know but his fastball was missing bigtime.
But they were swinging at it anyway. I guess they just think it is going to be in there all the time.
The only reason they won was that the big bats were working. I couldn't believe how the game ended.
I missed that...my phone rang and I forgot to pause it. But I heard about it on Sports Center this morning.
Well, it was the bottom of the ninth and they were only winning by 2. Don't you know the Rockies get a single putting a man on 1st base. Then the closer walks a guy. Now a guy on first and second.
Then what happened? How many outs were there?
There were 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth and the count is 3 and 2.
You've got to be kidding.
No way...with 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth, the guy lines one into left field and the players take off running.
Who was on base?
Two of the Rockies best runners.
What happened?
The first runner scores, the score is now 3-2.
I bet the place was going wild.
It was...until the second runner was thrown out at home! The throw from the outfield was perfect.
I could kick myself for not seeing that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best team in baseball?
The Astros.
Really?  What about the Yankees?
The Astros beat them 3 out of 4 last weekend.  They were dominant.
Yea, they are pretty good.  What is their weakness?
They are more than pretty good, they are very good.  I think they probably need one more quality staring pitcher.
Do you think they will get one?
I think they will make a trade for one by the trade deadline.
When is that?
The deadline is mid-July.
Do you think they will make it to the World Series?
For sure.  They have the best record right now and are very good.
How many games do you think they will win.
I would say 97 or 98.
You don't think the Rangers can catch them?
The Rangers are ok, but they have their own problems.
The Rangers beat them bad last year in their series.
This is a different Astros team.  A better blend of young stars and seasoned veterans.
I hope you are right.  Who do you think they will play in the World Series?
I think the Cubs will bounce back after their slow start.  It could be an interesting Cubs-Astros series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been following the New York Yankees this season?
Yes.  I wouldn't say they are my favorite team, but they are hard not to hear about.
I know what you are saying.  They are pretty much the most famous team in baseball.
I am impressed by the way that franchise has been turned around.
Exactly!  I mean it wasn't even that long ago they won their last World Series.
Yes, it seems like they rebuilt that team without truly rebuilding.
I agree.  They had some bad seasons, but they didn't seem to have a sustained span of being horrible.
It feels like Rivera, Jeter, and Rodriguez just left.  And they are right back to being contenders.
Yes, they remind me of the Cubs, with all that young talent.
Yes.  Aaron Judge is just an amazing player.
I know.  I cannot get over the size of that guy.
He has the height of a basketball player and the size of a football player.
It's amazing he's playing baseball, and even more amazing how good he is so far.
Yes.  And this is after Gary Sanchez and his awesome rookie season.
I mean the bottom line is, the Yankees are always going to be competitive.
Yes.  That history, and they have a lot of money to spend.
Let's not also forget that the team does seem well managed.
Yes, I don't think the Yankees get enough credit for the smart front office decisions they do make.
Agreed.  People think it's all about spending money, but you have to make smart decisions with that money.
Yes, I think the Yankees are a well-run club.  We'll see if this is already their year again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
How are you?
Well and you?
Not bad.  You into baseball?
Yeah I enjoy baseball.
Ever seen a game live?
Yeah I've been to a few Braves games.
Turner Field is a cool ballpark.
Yeah I always liked it.
Aren't they moving to a new stadium?
Yeah pretty soon.
Why are they doing that?
Honestly I don't know, easier to get to maybe?
And Turner field really isn't that old?
No, built it in the mid 90s I think.
That must cost a fortune for a new stadium.
Yeah, probably why the braves sold all their good players.
Ouch.
Yeah it was rough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you put into a pitchers record?
None at all.
I disagree
But how? He cant control everything
You want your ace on the mound and you want a win
But if he gives up 1 run over 8 and the offense doesnt score?
How often does that happen?
OK even if he gives up 2 over 7 and they score 1 run.
OK i can see your point slightly.
I value ERA over everything.
You are probably right.
The record doesnt state a whole lot.
So just get rid of them?
You cant do that
Then how would you fix it.
Maybe show the record in games he starts
Some guys get no run support
Like Cole Hamels?
Yeah just like him
So basically no Cy Young award winner should be based on record alone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big fan of the Twins?
No, I'm actually more of an Orioles fan.
I didn't know that! What inning is this?
Looks like the top of the third.
Orioles are killing it -- six runs already.
They usually do well at the beginning and then flunk at the end.
Well, the Twins have been terrible this year.
Have you gone to many games this year?
Only two. I've been too busy. What about you?
Three or four.
Do you have season tickets?
No. This is my first year I didn't buy season tickets. I kind of wish I had, now.
This pitcher isn't doing so well. He's walked everyone so far.
I don't know if I trust this ump's calls.
The Twins will probably get a run by getting walked in.
See that one? That was clearly a strike. The ump didn't call it.
Eh, it was little out of bounds. Maybe.
You're probably right. Ugh! The Orioles just get cocky. And then they lose.
One run for the Twins! Can't believe they walked a guy in.
Typical.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the Knuckleballer who is the 1st woman in West Coast League?
"Now would it be sexist if we slap her butt after a good outing, Dee?"
Come on man. I'm serious.
Really/ I thought you were joking.
No, I am dead serious.
Awesome! If a woman ever makes it to MLB, this is how it'll happen.
I hope to see it someday.
And I hope she succeeds unless she plays for the Cardinals, in which case I hope she's awful.
I'm sorry, did you just imply that a pitcher that came up with the Cardinals that should otherwise have only an outside chance at being on an MLB roster would be unaffected by our devil magic?
You know Jackie Mitchell was the first female player to play professional baseball.
I know. Legend has it that she struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in the same inning.
And the next day the commissioner voided her contract and declared that women were not fit to play baseball because it would take too much of a toll on their bodies or something like that.
Yeah. They banned us women from the MLB until the '90s.
You know what he was probably thinking at the time.
"Women need to say in the kitchen where they belong"
Not to be sexist or anything but I don't see why women would want to play professional baseball. All of that pitching isn't good for men.
So you think Babe Ruth was right?
What did he say?
Babe Ruth said something to the effect that women were too delicate and liable to get hurt if they played baseball.
I think baseball is hard on anybody's body. Man or woman.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Those Orioles pulled off another one
Yeah I saw that, in extra innings on top of that
Yeah it was a great ball game last night!
That Castillo home run was a thing of beauty
The great thing about that was he had just come off of the disable list
Talk about being ready to play!
Not only did he hit the game winning home run, he had hit another one earlier
That's a game you tell your kids about one day! Great performance!
Yeah they needed all of his offense last night
For sure and they best thing is that they are only 1/2 game behind the Yankees.
Did the Yankees play last night?
No, I believe they had the day off
Okay. Well that Castillo has been on fire since coming off of the DL.
Yeah I read on ESPN that he has been hitting .600 since coming off of the DL
Those are crazy numbers!
Hopefully he can keep that type of production up throughout the year
Yeah. They really needed this type of performance last night. The team has been struggling.
Yeah they were coming off of a 1-6 road trip.
They are fortunate to be only behind the Yankees by that 1/2 game.
Yeah they are. Now they need to pad some wins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about Chris Sale?
The guy is on fire right now.
He is still a headache to front offices.
Yeah but his talent.
He definitely has it but he pains people.
I think they look the other way.
I dont know eventually they wont do it.
8th straight 10 strikeout game.
Thats hard to pass up.
Think he gets the next mega contract?
I dont know I feel like hes going to have to negotiate his deal every year.
Yeah he might be one of those guys that only runs the 3 year deal every time.
He really talked his way into it.
I am sure the White Sox are glad hes not around anymore.
Not only them but the AL Central.
Well they only faced him every 5th day and the White Sox are good.
I am shocked Pedoria doesnt keep him in line.
Hes not a huge team leader.
I think he is
Not in the sense he would ruffle the pitchers feathers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you believe Barry Bonds will ever get inducted in the HOF?
He probably will at some point.
Why do you say that?
Some others who were suspected of steroid use made it in.
Who might that be?
Mike Piazza and Jeff Bagwell to name a few.
Do you think it will tarnish the HOF's reputation if some of these other guys get in?
I don't believe it will. The HOF is not for choir boys, but for outstanding players.
I guess you have a point. Guys like Bonds and Sosa were dominant even w/o steroids.
I believe over time people will forget about the other issues and realize how good there were.
Who is your favorite player of the "steroid era?"
Grifey Jr. by far.
He is one of my favorites too. Why is he yours?
I am a huge Mariners fan and watched him in his younger, glory days- so much fun to watch.
He was definitely infectious with that smile and the way he played.
Do you think he compares to anyone now?
Maybe Mike Trout- love watching him play. What about you?
I'm thinking the same guy- Trout is amazing.
Shame I don't like his team though.
Agreed...Go Mariners!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Good day.
Hi there.
Doing okay?
Yep, you?
Yep.  Do you like baseball?
Yeah I do.
Do you like a team?
I like the Rays.
Oh okay Miami cool.
Yeah my team.  what about you?
I'm a Twins fan.
How do you think you will do this year?
Started off pretty decent, maybe a good year.
Think you'll get to the playoffs?
Don't know, I sure hope so.
The Rays are not doing well right now.
Why is that?
Not sure, the players can't get going.
Sorry to hear that.
Maybe it'll change.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the steroid guys should get in the Hall of Fame?
yes with an asterisk,
Whys that?
Its important to note that these guys had talent they just gave into the evils of the game.
Barry Bonds could have done it without them.
Absolutely and he was doing great without them.
He just became the goat as far as homers by doing them
Yeah and that needs to be noted
What about McGwire.
I think he could have also done it without needing the drugs.
Yeah its a shame we never got to see how these guys could have been without them
To be honest I think baseball kind of needs them
For the scoring?
Yeah its just more exciting when teams were hitting the ball
Now they seem to be pitching experts
I mean you have guys with sub 2 ERAs that lead the league each year.
I think its cyclical and itll return to hitting soon enough
I dont think so.
Guys will find a new steroid that is not detectable
i doubt a comissioner will sit around and let it happen
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cincinnati Reds baseball game last night?
Yes, it was another poor performance by their starting pitcher.
I know.  Its sad that they have everything they need to win except the starters.
It has really hurt them that Bailey and Desclafani have been injured all year.
That is so true!  The Cubs aren't nearly as good this year so the Reds could have contended with even a marginal starting staff.
I know.  Its going to be another long year.
At least we have Votto and Cozart to watch.
Votto is always great but where did Cozart learn to hit all of the sudden?
The announcers were saying Cozart had a new stance that allowed him to be much more relaxed at the plate.
Whatever he is doing is working.  He should be the All Star shortstop this year.
He should be but with all those Cub and Cardinals fans voting for their players he probably won't be.
They start a series with Colorado tonight so that probably means a lot more runs scored.  Those guys can really hit.
At least it is at home.  The Reds play much better there.
Yes, we can be thankful the game won't be in the thin air of Colorado where the Rockies really hit.
How about we see if we can catch a game on Sunday?
That sounds great to me.  I haven't had a chance to see them live this year.
Great! I'll check to see what tickets are still available.
I wonder who the starting pitcher for the Reds is Sunday?
I am not sure it matters; they are all bad.
That is sad but true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite baseball team in the MLB?
I like the Brewers.
I am also a Brewers fan, have you ever been to Miller park?
Yes, I have been to the park but only once.  I wish they were doing better this year.
Me too.  I think they could still turn it around though.
I don't know if they will be able to, they are off to a rough start.
No kidding.  I am going to a game in the middle of June, can't wait.
That is cool.  Where are your seats?
We are sitting in the lowest section down the first base line.
Nice.  I have heard there is not a bad seat anywhere in the park.
I can confirm that.  I have sat in several locations and always enjoyed the game.
How many games have you been to?
I try to make it to five or six every year.
I wish I could go that often.  Who is your favorite player?
My favorite current player is Ryan Braun, but I was always a Prince Fielder fan.
My favorite player is Braun as well.
He does a great job at the plate and solid defense.
I was there when he hit a home run.
I have seen him hit a couple as well.
We should try to catch a game together sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bases have been weird this season.
They've been gross.
Lots of stealing.
Did you see the game with Boston?
What about it?
They killed all game.
Like, stealing?
It was extremely disrespectful.
How many?
20.
What?
Seriously.
Who does that.
I know.
That's nuts.
Boston is nuts.
God, I love Boston.
I know.
Insane players.
Absolutely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, know what bothers me about baseball?
*Sigh* You're always ranting about something with the game you pretend to love.
I rant because I'm passionate about it. Anyway, I hate the Little League World Series.
Of course you do. Why does it bother you?
It's the most pretentious thing in the world. It's not a series in any form whatsoever.
How so?
Well, it's two tournaments. The US teams, and "the others."
The sounds racist ...
Well, think about it. If it was truly a world series, the US champion would enter a field of all country's champions.
What is it now, I'm unfamiliar.
Well, here the champion of the other countries plays the champion for the US, and then they play a title game.
Oh, I see. It's not even a series. It's one game.
Precisely! It's also insulting to assume the US team automatically either wins or gets second place.
When in reality, if they entered the field, they could be eliminated after just two games.
Right. By hosting the tournament, the US automatically gets into the title game.
That's pretentious, but if we host the game, why won't we get an automatic bid?
Because that's poor sportsmanship.
I have a better explanation.
No you don't, but you may try.
If the US lost in the first round, no one would be at the games. These kids come from poor countries; their parents can't fly in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think about the Red Sox pitching situation.
What a mess. They need to get a couple starters and soon.
Yeah. It's too bad about Steven Wright.
Yeah. He can really eat up innings.
I hope David Price ends up coming back soon too.
Yeah that would be great. Hopefully he's fully healthy.
So who do you think they should bring in to pitch.
I don't know. There are a lot of starters out there who are free agents.
I think we should take a look at Jake Peavy.
Yeah he did well for the Sox before. But he's getting old.
Yeah he is but I think he'd do fine as a number 5 starter.
Yeah, I wouldn't expect too much from him but he could get the job done.
I also think they should look at Mat Latos.
What's happened to him? He can't seem to stay on one team.
I know. I don't know what his deal is.
Do you think he could turn it around and pitch well.
I do. I think he's just needs the right situation and the Red Sox could be that team.
It'd be interesting to see how he did in Boston.
I just hope they don't trade for Quintana from the White Sox.
Yeah. As much as I'd like him on the team, I don't think they should trade anymore top prospects.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Good, you?
Not bad.  You like baseball?
Yeah I like it.
Like a team in particular?
Yeah I like the Angels.
Oh cool, I'm a fan of the Yankees.
Cool, ever been to a game?
Yeah loads.
How was that?
A lot of fun always, although more expensive these days.  You ever been to a game?
No I haven't.
You really should it's great.
Yeah I want to go to one at some point.
It's a great place to take the family.
I bet.
Good talking to you.
You as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think wins the NL Central this year?
Chicago.
I want to believe that but its hard to repeat.
It is but not winning the division.
The Braves did it how many years in a row?
I think 13.
Yeah, so this could happen.
The Cardinals can never be counted out.
What about the Pirates?
I think their window closed.
That was quick. What a terrible franchise.
I think McCutchen is on his way out.
His defense is starting to wane.
They have moved his outfield position already.
Yeah, they dont have a ton of pitching outside of Cole.
They had the momentum for awhile.
But back to the Cubs. Are they a dynasty?
Theo Epstein only creates winners.
They drafted well.
Thats the key to winning in baseball, it takes time to rebuild.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Braves Blue Jays game?
No, what happened?
There were 5 near fights during the entire series.
Wow. Between those teams?
I know. They're not even rivals.
They play each other once every 3 years.
It got heated. The Blue Jays beaned 7 batters, including Freeman.
I hope the Braves retaliated.
Freeman's wrist was broken off one pitch.
Let me guess: Bautista had something to do with all of this.
Yeah, Bautista did a bat flip after hitting a homerun.
I think every team hates that guy.
The homerun and bat flip occurred when they were down 7-0.
The go has no class. I hope the Braves went after him.
They hit him the next game.
Did the benches clear?
No. It was that got him in the thigh. It didn't look like it affected him.
I can't wait until Bautista is out of the league.
He's always causing problems on the field.
It makes fans and teams hate the Blue Jays.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think we will see the end of the closer position?
I do. Its a meaningless stat nowadays
The game has evolved and teams need outs not guys for specific innings.
I always thought that having a guy for one specific inning was a bit bizarre.
Same here, I think that they need to get guys out when they come up in the order.
If the meat of the lineup is in the 8th then send out your best pen arm then.
More coaches will ascribe to that  in my opinion.
I think they should be able to pitch for 2 innings a time.
Try to get max effort from the arm
Yeah you need to see how many pitches were thrown
Too many teams have just seen the outs and then been done.
RIght so if a guy comes in with a runner on first and throws one pitch and gets 2 outs, why cant he come and pitch the next inning?
Yeah it never made sense but guys what to know their roles.
Their role should be to pitch when called.
Those dudes out in the pen are creatures of habit.
So you establish early on that no one has a specific inning.
That would be a culture change across the game.
The name of the game is to win
You are changing the landscape of one third of your team
For the positive though
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you watch the Royals game last night?
yes, it was another low scoring game.
Did they win?
Yes, they won 3-2.
What pitcher won the game?
Joakim Soria. I can't believe he actually got anyone out with his stuff.
Who was the starting pticher?
Danny Duffy. He did well, he allowed 2 runs in 7 innings.
Wow, that's great, too bad he didn't get the win.
Yes, he's been our only really reliable pitcher this year.
So how did the Royals score their runs?
Brandon Moss hit a home run into the fountains in right field.
I can't believe that! He's had such a bad year.
Maybe he is finally seeing the ball better.
Who will be pitching when we go to the game tomorrow?
Unfortunately, Chris Young.
Oh, wow, that's going to be a slugfest, and not good for us.  Well, at least our Mom's will have a chance to talk during the game since it will be over by the 2nd inning!
Well, going to the game is always fun regardless of how bad they do.
You're right, I'm really looking forward to going, since we don't get to go very often, and I know our Mom's will enjoy going to see a baseball game in person.
Me too, plus, they are giving away sun hats for Mother's Day for all of the Mom's, so that will be nice for them to wear while watching the game in the sun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where did the nationals begin their baseball history?
In Washington of course.
The team did go away for years.
What happened?
I just think the franchise just ended due to money.
It's been, what 5 years since the team started up again?
That sounds about right.
Have they ever one a world series?
I don't think so.
Do you think they have a chance this year?
I don't really know. I don't follow them.
I know what you mean.
They did look good at the start of the season.
Yeah, but you know how that goes.
Yup, good  time a good start and bam.
Yup.
What's next for them. Win 2 in a row.
Your funny.
I wish I could see them play thou.
They would be cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you play any sports?
Not recently. But I did play baseball in high school?
No way! Me too!
Sweet, did you go on in college.
I wasn't recruited at all, but I did play on a club team. It was more of an excuse to get together and drink.
Yeah, I played for a while in college, but stopped after freshman year. It was too much!
Yeah, I'd been playing since t-ball, so it was weird to stop, that's why I joined the club team.
I've thought about starting up an adult league around here.
That sounds sweet!
Would you be interested?
Yeah, totally. I think I have a couple buddies that would be too.
I was shortstop in college.
Yeah me too! My roommate was a pitcher. I haven't talked to him about uit, but he'd probably be down.
Sweet!
Have you thought about where we would play?
KInd of, I think maybe Oak Park. If we do it on a weekday I think there will be space.
That'd be sweet, not too far from my apartment.
Sweet! I'll ask my roommate and maybe put an ad on craigslist.
Yeah, keep me posted! My schedule's pretty open after work.
Nice. Play ball!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the marlins Ed?
yes, I do.
How often do you go to a game?
oh, about once a month
Do you like their new home field?
yes, it is great and a lot of fun.
How much are tickets for a game?
It depends, weekend or weekday?
On the weekends?
Well, A good seat near the field will cost around 50dollars.
How much for a seat in the bleachers?
The cheapest is around 10 dollars, in the nosebleed section.
How much during the weekday, with little crowds?
the price drops quite a bit, about half that of the weekend.
would you like to go during the week sometime?
yea, sure, why not.
will we have to buy tickets in advance?
no , you can just walk up, there is nobody there during the week.
ok, great...I will call you tomorrow.
ok, I will talk to you soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you keeping up with the Rangers this year?
Not as much as last year...they are really struggling.
Yeah, they have had a hard time fielding, hitting, and providing good relief pitching.
Well...that pretty much sums up what a baseball team does...ha!
Yeah...but they did just win their sixth game in a row!
Oh, nice, they are back in the hunt?
Not so much...the Astros won five-in-a-row until Texas finally picked up a game on them.
Well, on the bright side, Texas usually whips up on the 'stros. Well, usually.
The Yankees did beat the 'stros today and are playing the second game of a doubleheader.
So, do we have to root for the Yankees!?
Absolutely, not! We just root that Houston loses every one of their games against non-Yankee teams.
That's right, you never, ever root for the Yankees!
Oh, my greatest sports moment was watching A-rod strike out at the ballpark, the year Texas made it to the first World Series.
I was there!
No way! Are you serious...I would give so much to go back into a time machine for that moment!
Ha...well, I remember thinking for the first time ever that I was in a baseball town.
Hmm, for some reason, Hamilton didn't get that same sense.
Yeah, that was tough when he left Texas and criticized the fan base.
I'll tell you one thing, if we ever get a time machine...I am going back to Game Six and pulling Cruz out of the game!
Oh, man, you had to bring up Game Six...I am now sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a baseball fan like I am?
Yes I am!
What is your favorite team?
I would have to say the St. Louis Cardinals.
Me too! I have always supported them and they always do well.
They sure do, they win the world series often.
Who is your favorite player on the Cardinals team?
Well I would say Pujols but he left the team not long ago.
Yeah that was a shame, he was a good player
Do you know why he left the team?
No I do not, but I am happy that the Cardinals are still an amazing team without him.
Well that is because they have many other great players as well.
That is true, do you think they are going to win the next world series?
I sure do! I think that they have a really good chance this year.
I cannot believe the Cubs finally won it not too long ago.
Yeah that was amazing, nobody thought that they could pull it off.
Well they have always been rivals to the Cardinals and that helped them to get better.
I love the rivalries in baseball, it is one of my favorite parts.
Every team has their own rivals, drama makes anything more exciting.
It sure does as long as it isn't my own life that has drama!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Clayton Kershaw will ever pitch in the playoffs again?
Sure I do.
He has just been terrible in them.
Yeah he has but thats just how he is. LA will qualify for the postseason.
Does this take away from how effective people will remember him.
People carried around A-Rod's playoff failures so I think it does.
I cant believe Kershaw still has not figured it out.
Me neither its very bizzare.
Some guys are just not gamers.
I would not say that he isnt a gamer.
Yeah but he coils up in pressure situations.
Maybe he isnt a number one pitcher
In the regular season he is
Thats true I dont know what they should do with him
They are paying him like a top end ace and Joe Blanton pitches better than him
Didnt Blanton hit a homer before
Yes in the World Series for the Phillies.
Talk about a guy who has had a long career doing nothing
Well hes a champion
True I guess I shouldnt say hes done nothing
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello
Hi
How are you?
Very good and you?
Not bad.
Good, you like baseball?
I do enjoy baseball.
Ever been to a game?
Yeah a few, you?
Yep I've been to a few Royals games.
Oh okay neat.  I've only gone to Dodgers games.
I would go more, but its very expensive.
Yeah I hear that.
Are Dodgers games a lot?
Oh yeah, sometimes over $100 a ticket.
Wow, even for the nosebleeds?
Depends on the game, but yeah.
That is crazy.
Good chatting.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching the Cubs this year?
I sure have. I was so excited when they won last year.
Did you see the last game?
The one against the Cardinals? No I missed it.
I saw it, they won but I was nervous, it was so close.
Was it? I might be glad I missed it then.
Are you going to watch the game tonight?
I want to but I think it's postponed.
Who's your favorite player?
I really like Rizzo,
What do you think of Arrieta
I like him, but I miss Ross.
Who do you think will pitch tonight?
Probably Anderson if I had to guess.
Do you think they'll repeat their season?
Well, it's kind of early to tell but they look good.
What other teams do you like besides the Cubs?
I'm a pretty big Tigers fan
Do you ever go to their games when you're in Michigan?
I do! I love Comerica Park. It's pretty nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Twins game tonight?
no, who did they play.
The White Sox and they won 7-6
Oh, that's good I have given up on them this year.
Why is that?
Well, all there young talent offensively is not mature enough yet.
To make matters worse, there pitching is awful.
What part The starters or relievers?
Well, both. But especially there bullpen.
Yea I know. The pen has been bad especially their closer.Who is he again?
Brandon Kintzler. He just doesn't have lights out stuff, but tonight he got away with it.
Well at least he got the save.
Yes, but not without some nail biting.
Perhaps they can trade for a closer
Perhaps, but they would have to give up one of their offensive prospects.
If they did, who would you give up?
Probably Byron Buxton.
That's risky as he is their numeber one prospect
I know but he is only hitting .180
I get it. We can't wait any longer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Toles is out for the Dodgers.
Yeah, I heard he tore his ACL.
It looks like Cody Bellinger will get more playing time.
Is he any good?
He's been mashing so far since he was called up last month.
How's his D?
Not sure. He was mostly a first baseman in the minors, but the Dodgers are using him in the outfield.
That doesn't always work out too well.
Nah, he'll figure it out. He's still young. I'm not too concerned.
Yeah, maybe. What about Yasiel? He got off to a hot start, now he sucks again.
I know. I can't figure that guy out.
Maybe they should trade him.
His trade value is pretty low right now. I'd stick with him for now.
Would be nice if we could get something for him. We need a second baseman.
We get Forsythe back soon.
He's not that good!
He can play man! He's a great defender.
Overrated. Check out his UZR.
Man, I don't trust the metrics.
I'm telling you, he's totally overrated. We need Cano!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are we at a point where steroids may have been better for the game?
No way how can you say that?
Scoring was better back then
And the pitching was terrible.
There were great pitchers still available.
But people want to see scoring.
They do but they can solve that.
How?
Analytics is turning lineups into hit machines
I dont see it happening yet
It will turn eventually
I cant see that ever happening.
They will get better and learn to adjust
So you think this is just temporary?
Yes, a sub 3 ERA will not be the norm.
I just think when people hit homers more fans come out
Yeah but what were they worth knowing everyone was juicing?
I think people can forget about that.
Tell that to Rafael Palmeiro
Thats a different case. He juiced from day one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who were the Golden Glove winnders on the Giants for 2016?
They got THREE!  Buster Posey (catcher), Joe Panik (second base) and Brandon Crawford (shortstop).
Is Brandon Crawford off the DL?
Yes, he's back.  He was gone for a while because of bereavement leave for his sister-in-law.  He injured himself right around the same time.  But he's back.
Are there any other Giants on the DL right now?
The Giants have been having a lot of back luck with this.  Madison Bumgarner of course.  But he should be back in June.
Anyone else?
Yes, Mark Melancon, their new closer, has a right pronator strain.  He just returned and saved the game against the Cardinals on May 19.
Michael Morse is back, too.  In his first at-bat of 2017, he hit a home run off of Pedro Baez of the Dodgers.
He was pinch hitting.  Good to see him back.
Nunez is a base-stealing king.  How many bases has he stolen so far this 2017 season?
He's stolen eleven so far.  He has a career number of 116.  Can't turn your back on him.
I don't understand something.  What is the "infield fly rule"?
Wikipedia defines it this way:  "The umpire's declaration of an infield fly means that the batter is out (and all force plays are removed) regardless of whether the ball is caught. "
So if the defense doesn't catch the ball, it doesn't matter?
Kind of.  It's up to the umpire.  He has to make a determination based on what he thinks is the "ordinary effort" to catch the ball.
So if, say, a short-stop should catch a batted ball easily but he lets it slip through his mitt, the umpire can invoke the rule because the short stop should've caught the fly ball?
It's up to the umpire's discretion.  It's why they're trained and go to umpire school, I guess.  Makes sense.
Well, what's "ordinary effort"?  Is there some criterion or is it just whether the umpire is having a lousy day?
No, there are criteria.  Like weather, lighting, abilities of the player(s) involved, etc.  It's not as arbitrary as it might sound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I going tonight.
You are?
Yeah, plus I have an extra ticket.you want to go?
Oh yeah, Rockies and diamondbacks? Can't miss that.
Both teams are tied for first.
I know, both teams are in a 6 game winning streak.
Somebody has got to lose. Fisher is pitching for the rocks.
Who's pitching for the d back?
Don't know.
Oh.
What time do you want to leave?
Really early,I want to see batting practice.
The d back always put on a show.
They say that the d backs may win this game tonight, due to the hitting they have been producing.
It has been of the hook. Did you see the dodger game last night?
No, what happened?
Kershaw pitched a no hitter.
Really, he hasn't lost a game this year.
I wish I could see him pitch.
They are coming to town next week.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Red Sox - Yankees game last night?
Of course, I would never miss a rivalry game.
Did you watch the game until it was finished?
Yes, I watched the whole ballgame, even though it went into extra innings.
That looked like strike three to me.
I disagree, that pitch was outside.
How many homeruns do you think he'll hit this year?
Hopefully more than last year.
Why didn't the runner tag up on that fly ball?
I guess he didn't think it was hit deep enough.
Do you follow your favorite team's entire organization or only the major league club?
I only have time to keep track of the major league team?
What is your favorite MLB team?
My favorite team is the Chicago Cubs.
Do you think they retaliate for hitting that batter with the pitch?
Probably not, it didn't look intentional.
The shouldn't have walked that batter, he's really fast.
I agree.  He's probably going to steal second base.
Do you like the Designated Hitter rule?
No, I'm a fan of how the National League makes pitchers bat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What's up?
Not much.  You?
Same.
Do you watch baseball?
Yeah I like baseball.
Same here.
Do you have a favorite team?
I do.  But they're a local team.
Oh that's cool, we have one of those near us as well.
I love taking the family, so much fun.
Yeah I bet that is a good time.
What is the name of the team?
They're the smokies.
Oh okay, who are they a farm team for?
You know I'm not sure.  Mets maybe?
Oh okay.
See ya.
bye.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did ya'll see the Nationals and Pirates game yesterday?
Yeah, it was recording breaking for Frazier!
Yeah, I know! He a had a new career-high four RBIs! DO you know what the final score was?
Right! Pittsburgh beat the Washington 10-4!
Okay thanks! I wasn't able to see the very very end.
Gotcha. Frazier hit a two-run double in the sixth inning and a two-run single in the seventh!
Yeah man, I seen that too and he is MVP right now in my book!
Did you know that Frazier started this season as a utility player?
No, I didn't know that why?
Yeah, one reason is because center fielder Starling Marte is suspended until mid-July for violations.
OH WOW! I did not know about all that. Why was Marte suspended?
I had heard on NFL network that it had to do with some drug violation but I don't know any details.
Oh shoot! That' too bad.
Yep, Frazier is back after missing nearly three weeks with a strained left hamstring, and is on fire now!
You just never know what is going to happen in a season because of injuries and whatnot! Whats Frazier's avg?
He has a AVG of .347, last time I checked.
Oh okay, right on!
Frazier, the leadoff hitter, is 10 for 20 in his last four games, so we will see what the rest of the season has to hold!
Cool, baseball is my favorite pastime! Thanks for the updates!
Mine too! I just wish I had more time to watch it! Cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best manager in the game today?
Tough question considering the dynamics of the game.
So would you say Francona?
Yeah it could be him, he had success with Boston and Cleveland.
But did nothing in Philadelphia.
Different time, organization did not care about winning.
OK I could debate that seperately but do you give some credit to Maddon?
It would be between Francona and Maddon.
What about Maddon do you like?
He had success in Tampa and Chicago.
Tampa was harder to win
I agree with that but he didnt have a thin roster either
They were good even after they started turning guys over.
Havent heard from that  franchise since he left.
Yeah so I would say that it probably gets handed to Maddon.
He knew where and how to push the Cubs buttons.
He was brought in at the right time and made a huge difference
I would say hes a players coach.
Yeah so I think Maddon is definitely the best player in the game.
I would agree but Francona is not far behind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who has hit the most home runs in major league baseball?
Barry Bonds, who hit 762 home runs in his career.
Didn't he use performance enhancing drugs during his career?
I'm not sure, but allegedly he did.
I'm sure Hank Aaron did not during his career.
I agree, though that was before there were tests for steroids.
Didn't Hank Aaron have the most hits all time also?
Actually, no. That is Pete Rose who has the most hits.
I heard Pete Rose was banned from being in the hall-of-fame.
Yes, but it was not for steriod use, but for betting on baseball.
That's a shame, because he was such a great hitter.
Yes. He even helped his team to the World Series a few times.
Who did Rose play for in the World Series?
The Cincinnati Reds twice and the Philadelphia Phillies.
Did the Phillies just win the World Series a few years ago.
Yes, back in 2008 in fact.
Who did they beat to win the championship.
They beat the Tampa Bay Rays, who were in the World Series for the first time.
I read where the Yankees beat the Phillies the next year, in 2009.
Correct, and it was Derek Jeter's last World Series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Mariners and Twins game?
At Safeco Field? Yeah, I saw it.
Did you see that Cruz home run? That was massive!
Didn't he use steroids?
Well, yes, but that was in the past. He's with the Mariners now.
Oh, I  see.
Who started for the Mariners?
Oh come on, you know it was Paxton.
I think he has a sub-2.00 ERA
I think so too, he's really coming on.
So how are the Yankees doing?
One of the best, if not the best, team in the American League
Do the Yankees play the Mariners this year?
I know they did in years before, not sure about this year.
What happened to Ichiro after he left the Yankees?
I think he's in Miami now.
Soaking up the sun with the Marlins?
Yeah, I guess so.
He says he's going to play into his late fortes. I hope he does!
I hope so too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Dodgers?
Not really, I'm more of a Reds fan.
How did you become a Reds fan?
I spend part of my youth in the Cincinnati area
Really, I didn't know that
Yeah, my dad would take me to the games when i was a kid
Was it a cool stadium back then
It was okay. Riverfront stadium; one of those old multi-purpose donut shaped stadiums
Astroturf?
Oh yeah, just like all of them back then
Where do they play now?
I believe it's called Great American Ball Park
Really? That's the actual name?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's a corporate sponsor
I'm a Red Sox fan myself
Did you live in Boston?
Nah, I just like them since I think it's a cool team
Or rather, you started liking them once they started winning World Series titles
Well, everyone likes a winner
Whatever, man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you want to go see that Auburn Baseball game?
Nah not really.
Why not?
I don't like baseball
Dude, you obviously didn't see the last game.
What happened?
Ok so the auburn pitcher, top of the 9th, had 2 outs, 2 strikes and 2 balls right
Right.
And he decided to call a time out.
You can do that in baseball?
Apparently.
Ok continue
So he talked to the coach and decided to do something nuts
What happened?
He swapped with the catcher and he became the catcher.
Ok then what?
The the catcher pitched it, and actually threw a strike and struck the dude out!
No freakin way, how?
The guy took off his mask and it was Tim Hudson!
Bruh. No freakin way! Ok I gotta go see them play now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
How is it going?
Good, you?
Can't complain.
Do you enjoy baseball?
Yeah I do.  Do you like it?
Yeah sure do.  Do you have a team?
I guess I go for the A's from time to time.
Oh?
Yeah I'm not really attached.
They really aren't great these days.
Yeah that's what's tough about going for them.
I understand.
What about you?
I'm a Rays fan.
Oh Florida, interesting.
Yeah really like going to the games.
Good chatting.
Good talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know much about the history of baseball?
Not really. Baseball really isn't my thing.
How can you not like baseball?
Well, every time I'm forced to go to a game, everything feels the same every play, unless someone hits a homerun or something.
There's a lot more to baseball than hitting the most homeruns, and if you understood that, you'd be a lot more engaged while you watched.
Well, enlighten me.
First of all, baseball is a game that takes an investment of knowledge to enjoy watching.
What does that mean? That doesn't sound very fun.
It's like food. You can eat food and not really think about it, or you can learn about food and gain a pallette and suddenly your world is blown wide open.
So it would be worth it for me to learn more about baseball?
Definitely, because once you understand different batters' strengths and weaknesses, and you know the pitchers as well, their game becomes much more exciting.
Isn't it just throwing the ball and trying to hit it over and over again?
No! The pitchers know the batters, and know how they hit. And the batters know the pitchers, and know how they throw. And then it becomes an exciting duel!
I'd rather just watch professional wrestling and see people get thrown around.
You're unbelievable! Here, we're going to a baseball game right now!
I can't, I have to watch my kid while my wife is out. We could turn on the TV and watch a game though.
Do it! I'll walk you through every detail, and you'll love it by the end of it. I haven't even talked about the pitcher getting tired yet.
Sound great. You grab some beers out of the fridge and I'll get the TV warmed up.
Hey, I'm back with the beer! Wait, where'd you go?!
I'm running out of the house to get away from you and baseball!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the Mets game last night?
No, I was busy at work. How did it go?
The Mets won, 5-0. It was a complete shutout.
Yeah, the Mets have been doing really well this season.
I've actually got tickets to see one of their games next weekend.
Oh, really? What day?
Saturday. It's in the afternoon, so it should be a great game for the kids too.
That sounds like a fun family day.
Yeah, the kids are really excited. My wife, not so much, but you know how it is.
Actually, my wife is really a bigger Mets fan than I am.
Really? Have you and she gone to any games yet this season?
No, but she keeps on bugging me to go. I think she might just give up and buy tickets without me.
No, you should go too--they're really good this season, it would be fun.
Yeah, I've been really busy at work lately but it's dying down now, so I think I can make the time.
We should go together with our families sometime.
That would be fun! I'll check with my wife when we're free.
Sounds good. I'll email you a list of games so we can coordinate.
That would be great. Have fun on Saturday!
We will! See you at a game soon.
Yes, see you soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alright, dude, I got a beef about baseball.
I'm trying to eat...
Anyway, why aren't more baseball players in jail?
Again, I'm eating here. But go ahead. What are you ranting about this time?
Well, we see baseball players get into fights on a semi-regular basis. At least every week or two the benches clear, there are punches thrown.
Yes, and?
And they take bats and destroy them, they break water coolers when mad, they throw bases around.
Yeah, they're playing kids games. They're kids, pretty much. What's your point?
What are the penalties that they get from MLB?
Usually a $5,000 fine and a 2- to 3-game suspension.
And if this happened in real life? Someone throws an object at your head at 95 miles per hour, and people get into a big fight?
They... oh...
Yeah, they go to jail. And pay fines that actually cost a lot of money, relatively, instead of the amount they get paid per inning played.
So, why do you think they don't go to jail?
I don't know. They should, especially if they are supposed to be role models for kids.
I'd love to see cops on the field actually putting these players in handcuffs and tasering them.
Their personalities alone deserve it. But anyway, the other problem is that MLB doesn't do enough to dissuade the fights.
The fans cheer it heavily, too.
So, they are promoting violence while not showing any true consequences.
Yeah, they care more about what players put into their bodies than actual crimes. Kind of weird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see the Reds and Cubs game yesterday?
Yeah, but I had to turn in early.
Oh okay, well it was a great game because the Cubs won!
Oh nice! What was the final score?
The Cubs ended with 9 and the Reds had 5.
How are the Cubs doing this season? Do you know?
Doing alright! It is a close season so far though because they are 21-19.
Where was the game yesterday?
It was at Wrigley Field. I have been there a couple of times and hope to go again soon!
Yeah, I have been there too!
Yeah, so Lester extended his winning streak at Wrigley Field yesterday to 11 straight at Wrigley now!
Oh nice! Bryant is lookin good and can knock it out!
Yeah, he hit a home run!
I thought that I heard on Sport news that his BA is .297. Does that sound right?
Yep, that is was I heard too.
Do you happen to know how much a ticket runs these days?
For Wrigley's Stadium?
Yeah, I paid about $50 dollars the last time I went but I was wondering what they cost now?
I know that you can get a real good ticket, on Stub Hub, for around $165 now.
Cool & Thanks! Have a good day..... I am gonna look into getting a ticket now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well I guess the Astros are for real. They now have the best record in baseball.
They have been impressive the past two nights beating the Yankees.
They won't get a chance for a third straight win until tomorrow.
Why's that?
Game just got rained out I saw. Yankees are probably relieved.
Who's been the Astros best hitter this year? Don't hear much about them.
I guess Altuve, they've been pretty balanced.
Are they going to play a doubleheader tomorrow?
I doubt it, will probably make it up later in the year.
Yeah, doubleheaders usually seem to be later in the summer.
Plus tomorrow is Jeter night on ESPN and they wouldn't want to have the first game run late.
That's true, I forgot about that.
The Cardinals are suddenly in first place now. How did that happen?
Are they? Jeez, didn't they start like 4-10.
Something like that, although they did lose last night to the Cubs.
That whole division is close, I think the Cubs are near the bottom.
Yeah, for now, I don't see it lasting though.
Yeah, no way the Cubs are going to finish below the Reds.
Well at this rate...they don't seem to have their heads in the game.
Still 100+ games to go though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What a game last night.
It sure was.
Aren't you glad you we?
Yes, thanks for the tickets.
No problem.
So now we are in first place?
We are tied with the giants.
How long have they been our rivals?
Ever since both were in New York.
Wow.
That was cool you got a foul ball.
It was pretty cool.
What did you do with the ball?
I gave it to my boyfriend.
Does he know you went with me?
No, if he found out he would be upset.
Let's take him tonight.
Let's buy tickets.
I'll buy them.
Get 4 tickets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite play in baseball?
Ooh, that's a tie between a "little-league homerun" and an "inside the park homerun".
Why is that?
Well, these are all highly-paid super athletes. Yet these two situations rely on gross incompetence.
How so?
Well, the little-league home run is based entirely on errors. It's usually a bases-loaded situation and the team just over throws or misses their targets, letting everyone continue to run.
So, it's not a home run, then.
What?
It's a series of errors, not a home run.
You know what I mean. But the best part is a little-league grand slam.
I saw that the other day! It's hilarious.
So what's more exciting, the inside-the-parker or the little-leaguer?
I like the inside-the-park, because it's less on human error, minus a judgement call, and more about a massive sprint.
It's especially funny when the batter is fat.
Yeah, an easy inside-the-park homerun would be barely a triple for Frank Thomas. If not, an out.
So, hypothetical situation:
Ok, go.
Let's say two outfielders are both going to the ball, but collide and are both knocked out. Is it an error or a hit?
No idea, but I'd pay good money to watch that. That seems hilarious.
Yeah, even more so if the third outfielder runs up to get the ball, and trips over them. Just a series of injuries.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think has the best farm system in baseball?
Well you could say the Yankees.
Its amazing considering how they used to be.
I know, when did they ever have a farm system?
Well it used to be all other MLB teams.
I think we have passed that time in baseball.
Yeah, teams are smartening up with that.
Well they are just giving out extensions earlier on so players arent costing as much
But salaries are rising so I think you are confused
Yeah a few get those massive deals but for the most part theyre cheap in the beginning
Thats always been how it is.
I dont think you are understanding me.
I am, you are saying they are locking guys up.
Yeah, so theyre cheaper.
Not really, arbitration years are usually inexpensive.
Well you dont have to pay the premium at 23.
But you are paying them when they are hitting their prime.
So there will be a half billion player soon enough?
I think two - Trout and Harper
No way, thats too bogus
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like to watch baseball
yes sometimes
oh really? do you watch it often
i watch it once or twice a week
do you like the red sox?
oh absolutely
i think they were better a long time ago
yes but theyve had to mature
lots of other baseball teams are still good
yes i know but the red sox arent exactly bad
yeah i guess you are right
i think baseball is the best sport
i agree its always exciting
how expensive are the tickets to the games
they usually are not too bad
i have only ever been to a few
yes me too
i think if they were cheaper i would go
me too
we should go together sometime
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Pete Rose?
I think he is one of the greatest, most hard-working players in MLB history.
And...?
And he bet on the game. He should be banned--it's the rules.
But he never bet on his team to lose.
So?
So that means he wasn't intentionally throwing games as a manager. He was trying to win.
So?
So he didn't really do anything WRONG, just went against a rule that had been around for a while.
He still broke it.
Yeah, but in a good, competitive way. He wanted to win and make some extra on the side.
I still think he should be banned.
I think he should be recognized as the second-greatest hitter ever.
Why second? You're clearly a fanboy.
Well, he's not baseball's all-time hit leader.
In 17 years, he got 3,000 hits ... but had far more in Japan.
How much more?
Well, last year he passed Pete Rose as the all-time hit king.
Dang, I didn't realize that.
You'd hate him. He didn't bet on the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How is Jose Bautista still in the league?
Hes good at hitting I guess
Yeah but I thought he was a steroid stallions
Nah theyve gotten those guys out
Yeah you are probably right
I cant believe though that some players still do them
They have to get a leg up on people
Just makes me upset youd think theyd be smarter
The name of the game is getting paid and homers get you paid
I think the analytics would refute that
How?
Teams are looking for all around hitters now
Yeah but if you can hit a dinger and be able to get a double teams will swarm to you
Most of the issues are still in Latin  America
Theyre all doing aderall I dont know about steroids
You can easily get a prescription for that
Can you?
A team doctor will do it to avoid the suspension
I just dont see how it affects baseball
Me either but it definitely does.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you feel is the greatest baseball player of all time?  I have quite a few ideas myself.
Wow, that is a hot topic that would have plenty of good arguments.  I could only say fro sure that the most winning team was the Yankees. Great players mostly have great statistics
Sure, the hall of fame is full of players with high statistics that were consistent.  I would go with Ted Williams as the greatest hitter, although he was an average player in the field.  Then there are the players in the dead ball era.
There were quite a few players at and above Williams' level. How about Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth?
They were both quite fantastic in their times and there was much excitement and controversy around their careers and styles. I also liked Hank Aaron
Sure, he had the numbers and was very consistent for about 22 seasons.  The only controversy was when he approached the home run record.  Sadly, there was a lot of hating going on.
He was a good fielder and all around player.  A strong role model as well.  A credit to any team and someone to look up to.  He belongs higher on the list than he might actually be.
There were quite a few players with high numbers in the 80's to the 2000's that put up astounding performances like Mark McGuire, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and others that subsequently were found to have used performance enhancement drugs
Yeah, that got into the courts and some players were to have been found to even committed perjury i think.  It was really sad.
Sure for quite some time there were so many players that suddenly came to camp looking like the Incredible Hulk.  It was in all of the sports to some extent.  You can't really blame the athletes too much as they all wanted to achieve stardom, do it better and faster, be stronger to dominate
Yes, and many looked the other way as the hulks were drawing crowds with their exploits.  The players to really admire during this period are ones like Derek Jeter who never touched the stuff and played outstanding ball for a generation.
Absolutely, and it seems the ones that got caught up in the steroids are not getting into the Hall of Fame too fast either.
Yeah, guys like Mickey Mantle were pretty big but he was naturally with a great physique.  I guess the only thing you could say about him is that he hurt himself by drinking too much and didn't take very good care of himself.
Back to the great players.  There were a lot of great pitchers.  Of the more modern era I liked Nolan Ryan, with all those strikeouts.
Sure, He had a hundred mile an hour fastball and threw it until he retired in his late forties somehow.  He was very intimidating to the batters.
He wasn't known for hitting batters on purpose, the fast pitch was hard enough to hit and he was a tough guy but a pretty good sport.
One that did not get much notoriety was Hoyt  Wilhelm.  He didn't make the majors until his late 20's from his war service and was best known as a n awesome relief pitcher.
I think he hit a home run in his first big league at bat and had a screwball that was almost impossible to hit.  I don't know how many saves he had but i think he played until he was almost 50.
Now the pitchers usually only pitch for a few innings and are pulled for specialists like mid inning relievers and closers.  They usually only allow them to throw a certain number of pitches then pull them out to not strain them.
Well, I think the greatest of all time was Babe Ruth as he was a great pitcher who turned outfielder so he could play and hit every day.  He was another one that lived too fast and did his body harm from that.  I guess the argument would go on forever as long as the game will be played..
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch Major League Baseball?
A little, but I don't follow it religiously.
Yeah, me too. I have a team that I support, but I don't really watch very often.
What team do you root for?
I'm an Atlanta Braves fan.
Oh really? I'm a Nationals fan.
They're in the same division I'm pretty sure. I actually think Washington and Atlanta are about the same amount of distance from where I live.
Oh cool, how did you become a Braves fan?
My dad was a Braves fan. There weren't really any other teams in the south east until the 90s I think, so there are a lot of Braves fans around here.
That makes sense. I like the Nationals because I live very near Washington DC and they've been a good team recently.
Cool, did you ever play organized baseball?
Yeah, I played through senior year of high school.
Oh really? Me too, I played through senior year as well.
You know, I like playing baseball and going to the ballpark to watch games, but it's really boring to watch on TV.
I agree. I played it and it's fun to go to the ballpark to watch in person, but watching it on TV can be pretty dull.
It's also hard to keep up with your team consistently because the season is so long.
Yeah, the season is 162 games long I think. That's a lot of games to devote time to.
True, but I doubt they'll shorten it.
Yeah, I don't think they'll shorten the season either. That would mean less revenue.
And I hope they don't lengthen it either. It really doesn't need to be any longer than it already is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you pitched?
Yeah, In high school. varsity. Saved a few games, actually.
Nice. How fast is your fastball?
I'mm a side armer, so my fast ball isn't my forte, you know.
Ok, what is? Curve ball? Slider?
Slider definitely. I got it to a point where it spirals.
The thing is, though, it could spiral all it wants, if it goes over the plate straight, it's useless
Yep, yep. my curve does that. But my slider, it spirals right up to the plate.
Nice. That must be hard to hit.
Yep, yep. I used to love watching that slide up and way into the right corner of the box.
You said you saved a few games?
Yeah, i get tired easily, so I didn't start much, but I can shut out a team for a few innings.
Nice. That's gotta be a bummer though. Not being able to start much.
Well, it's a team game. I don't mind. This one time We were up by 2 and it was the 5 inning. And boom, all of sudden they were up by 3 point.
So they scored 5 points nonstop?
Yeah, just back to back. They were just banging it out. So I was told to go in
Man, that's some nerve racking job.
Yeah, but I did Ok. Shut them down pretty quick with my sliders.
Spirals, up and away eh?
Yep. Up and away into the right corner. Straight to the top corner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you ready for the big game tomorrow?
Not really.  I need to buy a new bat.
What's wrong with your old one?
I broke it at practice yesterday.
Was it when you hit that home run?
Yeah, it cracked down the side.
That was a sweet hit though.  I hope you do that during the game.
Thanks.  I'll try.
You can use my bat for practice today.
Alright.  What brand is it?
It's a Louisville Slugger.
Nice!  My old bat was a Louisville.
I've had them since i was little.  My dad always bought them for me.
Yeah, my grandfather bought me my first one.
They are my favorite bat.  I've tried so many others.
Same here.  There's nothing like a Louisville.
What type of glove do you use?
I have a Wilson.
Mine is an Rawlings.
Cool!  Let me check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Giants extra inning game the other night?
Yeah, 17 innings, unbelievable!
Maybe, the Giants will get going now--it's been a rough start to the season.
What are they something like 12 and 24?
I think so--they are so bad I don't even look at the standings anymore.
I know I don't even know who is ahead in the division.  It's usually the Dodgers, but I don't think so this year.
Maybe Arizona, I'm not sure either.
It could be the Padres or Rockies as far as I know.
Anyway, back to the extra inning game--Posey winning it with a homer, that was something.
He was so tired after catching all those innings, he was more relieved than joyful.
And I can't believe the Giants relievers held the Reds down for all those innings.
Yeh, the pitching has been pretty bad all season and with Bumgarner out it is even worse.
But he hasn't even won a game this year.
Well he was pitching fine--not his fault we can't hit either.
We've gotten it going lately, some hitting, and I think we've won 6 out of seven games.
Something like that--won the Reds and Dodgers series, but now we're on the road.
Where are they going?
Chicago for one I think--Krukow and Keiper were talking about Wrigley Field being remodeled and complaining about the fact that it will be awhile before the announcers' booth is worked on.
Those guys are entertaining.
Well, I hope we can keep it going on the road.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the pirates baseball game against the yankees last night?
Yes I did. that game was amazing!
I know. The way it ended with a grand slam was unexpected.
I agree. that was one the longest home runs I have ever seen.
yeah, it was crushed! the sound it made off the bat you knew instantly it was a home run.
Sounds like you were at the game?
I was at the game. Sat right behind home plate. It was awesome
I'm jealous. I have always wanted to go to a game, but just watch on TV
I would recommend it. The pitching was great for seven innings.
seemed like a pitchers dual for most of the game until the 7th when the bats woke up
the last three innings took forever to play.
I know. so many pitching changes and no one could get an out.
The worst part is that they stop serving beer after the 7th inning. It's a law I guess.
I didn't know that! I had more beer from the 7th inning on then I did in the first part of the game
Yeah, that's the benefit of watching at home. If was still cool to be there and see the walk off grand slam
It looked like a fun time.
You should come with me next time. i have season tickets
I would love to. let me know when the next one is.
Great. I hope the Pirates make the playoffs this year
Me too. that would be neat to watch! Go Pirates!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What time is Eric's ball game today?
It starts at noon, but we're supposed to be there about 11:00.
Really?  Why an hour early.
The coach wants to talk to the parents.
Oh geez, let me guess... He's quitting.
I don't know.
I'll bet he's quitting.  That would make the third coach in two years.
Don't get ahead of yourself.
Well... It's hard not too.  It's frustrating.
I know, Eric loved baseball when he started with Coach Roberts.
Yeah, Roberts was a great coach, all the kids loved him
I get it though.  I mean, how much can a guy take?
I know! I would never have stayed as long as he did with all the crazy, screaming parents.
I'll never understand how two adult men can get into a fist fight over a little league baseball game.
Me either!  People are nuts!
Why can't they get into their heads it's just a little league game for fun!
They all take it like their kid is in the World Series.
If their kids had any real talent, they would playing in the pay leagues so just let them have fun and make mistakes
I'm surprised Roberts made it as long as he did.
I know I would never volunteer for it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Dodgers this year?
I assume they'll be good. They have such a big payroll.
Yeah, but they're trying to spend less now.
It doesn't seem like it.
Well, a lot of their payroll is for players no longer with the team.
They do have some good young talent, right?
They have good young players at several positions.
Like who?
Corey Seager is a really good shortstop in his second year.
Who else?
Cody Bellinger is a power hitter that just came up.
How's he doing?
He's already hit a bunch of home runs in his first two weeks since being called up.
Where does he play?
He can play first base and left or right field.
Any young pitchers?
Yeah, Julio Urias is only 20 and he's really good.
Yeah, I heard about him.
They signed him when he was 16 so he already has a lot of experience in the system.
Ok, so the Dodgers will be good again, but can they win it all?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Derek Jeter had his number retired the other day?
Yeah! Wasn't it Saturday night at Yankee stadium?
Yup, I was there with my family, the Yankees dedicated a plaque for him too.
I'm so jealous! I used to love watching Derek play.
Same here, but I don't think he's the greatest Yankee player to play the game.
C'mon are you serious?!
Yeah dude lol Derek Jeter only had 260 home runs his entire career...
Ok so what's your point?
Babe Ruth had 714 home runs, you just can't compare the two.
You certainly can. Derek Jeter was a 14x Allstar player, Babe Ruth was only a 2x Allstar player.
Hmm but Babe Ruth was a 7x World Series Champion.
Derek Jeter was a 5x World Series Champion and won the Golden Glove 5x.
Look man I'm not disagreeing with you but Derek Jeter will never be on the same level of Babe Ruth.
I guess only history will tell.
History has already spoken, I've never seen Derek Jeter hit 4 home runs in a single game.
Your telling me you saw Babe Ruth hit 4 home runs in a single game?
No I wasn't alive back then but it's documented that he did.
I still think Babe Ruth is over rated, baseball has changed so much since he played.
Whatever dude. Derek Jeter isn't even in the Hall of Fame.
Not yet, he's certainly going to be inducted though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the yankee game last night?
No, I couldnt stay up that late
I cant believe it went to 18 innings
I know that is crazy, has that happend before?
No I think thats the first time
Crazy. The yankees have the giant player on their team
Yea hes like 6' 7" and has already hit around 12 home runs
Wow he is huge. could be the next barry bonds
I hope that the cubs dont win again this year
How come?
They have so many bandwagon fans
I'm kind of a cubs fan....
When did you first become one?
Almost eight years ago
Oh then youre not a bandwagon fan
How come?
Because the bandwagon fans started becoming fans after they won the world series last year
Haha very true
We should go to a game soon, they have good beer at the ballpark
Yea that sounds like a great time
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe how bad the Mets have been this year.
Yeah, they've been struggling a lot.
Well they thought they would have great pitching but injuries have killed them
Losing Syndergaard is a killer.
Yeah, and Harvey has been terrible.
I think he is still hurting.
Well he had a major injury the last two years.
I'm not sure he has it anymore.
It would stink if he is never great again.
He was the future,  He was going to be a Cy Young winner.
Well at least they still have DeGrom
Yeah, but he's coming off injury too.
He looks decent this year.
Hope he is ok in the long run.
I think he will be.
They need him to be a top pitcher.
Then they just lost Familia too.
I know.  Unblieveable.
I think it's going to be a down year.
Looks that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game last night?
Which one?
The Red Sox of course
No, i missed it. did we win?
You wouldnt believe the game. it was crazy.
Extra innings?
Even better. it was tied 6 to 6 in the 8th and the mariners hit a double with a runner on second
oh snap. did boston make a comeback in the 9th?
at the top of the ninth boston goes does 2 outs. then a string of hits and crazy plays.
yes! go sox!
so boston ends up with two outs and bases loaded. big papi gets to the mound and smash a fastball 400 feet deep.
so that was it then we won?
no it was foul, so he had to run back to home.
aw no. tell me he had another chance.
so ortiz gets to a full count, 2 outs. bases loaded. and CRACK he sends it over center field.
thank goodness
yep we go up and close out the mariners in bottom on night. great day for boston.
im sorry i missed it.
youre telling me, i won 200 bucks last night.
you lucky sonofagun. now go park the car in the yard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Cardinals and the Marlins the other night on ESPN?
No, I missed it. Did Ichiro play?
No, but he is still playing for the Marlins.
Didn't he play for the Seattle Mariners for a long time?
Yes, he did for about about 12 years.
There was one season that he got an enormous number of base hits, if I recall correctly.
You're probably thinking about 2004, when he got 262 hits, breaking George Sisler's single-season hit record.
Did he play in the minors before coming into the big leagues?
No, but he played professionally in Japan for about a decade before coming here to the states.
Did he really? So he's played for about a quarter century then.
Yes, and he's 43 years old, and still in amazing shape.
That's crazy, especially when most baseball players retire well before they're 40.
By the way, there are many seasons in which Ichiro got an enormous amount of hits.
Do you think he will be in the hall of fame at Cooperstown one day?
Without a doubt, he will be, and most likely in the first year he's eligible.
Sounds like, if he got many hits per season over many seasons, he would have racked up a whole lot of career hits.
Yes. In fact, when you count his hits in Japan with his hits here in America, he actually has more than Pete Rose.
And Pete Rose is the all-time career hits leader here in America.
That's correct, but they never really talk about his hits in Japan that much.
I still find it incredible the amount of hits total he has as a pro.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the American League so far this year?
Hard to talk about the AL without mentioning the Yankees.
I know, right? What's going on there?
Somehow they're cranking out wins left and right.
Do you think it could be because they've been playing a lot of interleague games.
Maybe. But they're doing pretty well otherwise.
Yeah, that's for sure. I can't believe it myself.
Who do you like on the team?
Well, Betances is playing well as usual. But Judge is really knocking balls out of the park.
Yes, I think he has strong Rookie of the Year potential.
Okay, so that's the Yankees. What else?
Well, the East is stacked! How about the Orioles?
Okay, they're fine. The Red Sox aren't bad either.
I suppose there's the Twins, but they won't last. We all know there's one other team looming large.
Yes, Houston. Best record in the AL. Can it last?
It can, it can. They have a great rotation.
They're playing in the weakest division.
By far. It'll help them win games, but it'll mean their competition isn't as strong.
Could it be a disadvantage in the postseason?
Yes, it could. It definitely could.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the front runners for the World Series are this year?
Well, I think obviously you have to start with the two teams that were in it last year, the Cubs and the Indians.
But both of them are struggling a bit right now, and other teams are surging.
Well, yes they aren't leading either of their perspective leagues, but I think they are still frontrunners.
Why do you think that is?
I think the Indians are a little banged up, and coming off a long year, and they are still in the lead of their division.
What about the Cubs?
The Cubs still have one of the most dangerous and young lineups in Baseball.
Yeah, but they don't have great starting pitching and their bullpen is not great.
That is true, but they can always go and get someone at the deadline.
What about Encarnacion not playing well?
He has traditionally gotten off to slow starts, but I think he will pick up where he left off last year. Who do you like?
Well, I think that the Yankees are a year ahead of schedule and they are young and powerful lineup that can really do damage.
You think the Cubs pitching staff is bad, but you are okay with the staff of the Yankees.
Of course not, just like Cubs, their starting pitching is pretty bad. But they have a lot of ammunition for midseason trades.
That is true, they do have a lot of young talent, but will they be willing to part with it, for rental players?
I think they will move some pieces.
What about in the National League, anyone you like?
Other than the Cubs, I guess the Dodgers would be the favorite. Best pitcher in baseball and also that lineup.
Yes the Dodgers are always a threat to win it all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What a season the Giants are having!
Yeah, unbelievable, and not in a good way.
After they got Melancon, it seemed like their troubles were over.
Yeah, spring was full of promise...
Until they hit the windshield like a bloated horsefly at 80 MPH.
Then the Bumgarner thing!
Yeah, what was he doing, somersaults on a dirt bike?
Dunno, but his contract's up this year.
Not a good for him heading into negotiations for a big payday.
He's been so cool about it though, never complained.
He'll still do pretty well.
Yeah, but not as well as he would've. Really bad timing.
You know when he's coming back?
It was supposed to be after the All-Star break, but now the Giants are talking August!
Figure if they lose 10 games they might've won with him pitching, there goes the playoffs.
It's going to be tough...
But lately they've shown signs of life.
Reverting to the mean, to some extent.
They couldn't keep losing the way they have.
It's good to Melancon earning his money, too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know about the NHL.
The league's weird recently.
It's the rules.
They were considering changes, yeah?
They were debating it.
Hot takes about changes.
The hottest takes.
Would it be so wrong though?
For what?
Maybe changing the rules with shooting.
For what?
To make the game more dynamic.
Like, less long range and mid range play?
Yeah.
That's gross.
Like you don't like the fights.
I like the tactics.
You like the blood.
I mean.
Both of us do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Braves and Blue Jays last night?
Yeah, Braves looked terrible, and now Freeman is out.
It was dumb for Braves to retaliate against Bautista
Yeah, all that happened was that he got a free base and that started a big inning
If you're going to throw at someone, just scare them I guess. Why put them on base?
Yeah what good does it do to put baserunners on for no reason? I never understood that
Both those teams are terrible anyway.
The whole NL East is bad except for the Nationals, how many games will they win that division by?
Jeez at least 20 probably. Even the Mets are way under .500.
And weren't they in the playoffs last year?
Yes, and the World Series the year before.
Well the Royals won it that year and they are even worse I think.
I tell you, small market teams have to do everything right to stay relevant. They need too much luck every year
Yeah, the Royals caught the breaks but now they're not. Big market teams can rebuild much quicker
Look at the Pirates, they had to lose for 20 years just to get enough good players to finally make the playoffs
Yeah, and now they're in last place again. Hopefully it's not another 20 years
Other than the Rays for a few years and the Royals for a few years, it seems like there are about 10-15 small teams that are invisible.
I think the Twins and Brewers are actually in first place, but how many people realize that?
Probably cause their stays won't be long. I can't see the Indians and Cubs not winning those divisions.
Yeah, but they have both struggled for 40 games now. Still asleep at the switch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to have such a crush on Catfish Hunter.
On who?
James Augustus Hunter. A Kansas baseball team gave him the nickname, to increase his folksy allure.
So he was a Kansas sensation.
Actually, he moved with the team to Oakland California, where they became the Oakland Athletics.
Ah. I've heard of the Oakland A's.
Of course you have. I'm surprised you haven't heard of Catfish, a creature of grace and beauty, I'll tell you.
So he had a long and sucessful career with the A's.
Sucessful. Maybe not so long.
Oh? What happened?
After nine years with the A's, I think, he did about five years with the Yankees. I still watched him when I could.
And then he retired, rich and happy?
No, not quite. This isn't one of those happy baseball stories.
What happened, a scandal?
No, a disease or two. First, diabetes.
So he had to quit?
Retire, you mean. Yes, he did. A sad day.
And then he got to watch his grandchildren grow up.
No, then he died of ALS. At about 53, I think.
Huh. Lou Gerig's disease. How sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you watching the Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners right now?
Yeah, low scoring game, but Marcus Stroman is pitching strong
Sure is. Too bad he gave up that double to Ben Gamel in the 5th which scored a run.
I know! At least that only tied the game.
That's true, until Jarrod Dyson's singled to score Danny Valencia from 2nd base for Seattle
Hey...Still more innings to be played. We can come back
Woo!!! Home run from Kendrys Morales to tie it back up!
Yeah!!! That ball got out of here in a hurry!
Like you said, Still more innings to be played. Now it's a game again
Looks like they are pulling Stroman, and Jason Grilli is pitching now
Uh oh! Hope he doesn't let this one get away from him.
I know! he has been off and on all season so far.
And now he's given up a couple singles already.
But here comes Aaron Loup to hopefully get us out of this inning
He has been pitching well for Toronto this season.
And he strikes out Seagar!
Wow, they only put in Loup for one batter, now here comes Dominic Leone
And Leone gets them out of the inning
Let see if Toronto's Bullpen can keep this up
Right! We could really use another win right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think has the best team in the American League?
For sure the Yankees
No way they have no pitching and minimal hitting
Well who do you think is the best
The Red Sox are going to dominate the rest of the season
Why do you think that the Sox are good
One of the best starting pitching staff if not the best
Yea but their in third place whats so good about that
The hitting hasn't come around yet so they haven't supported the starters
They scored double digit runs over the weekend
I know hopefully that will start a trend
I think they have a great closer too but I still think the Yankees will beat them
How about we put up a bet who ever is right gets a free meal at any restaurant
Sure thing but I'm not sure where I will be choosing once the Yankees take first place
Oh don't waste your time worrying about something that won't happen
Haha we should get tickets the next time the two play each other
Sounds like a plan to me I'll check out the schedule later on
I'll be wearing my pin stripe shirt and yankees hat
And I will be taking pictures of you looking like a fool.
Can't wait go Yankees stop the sox.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Chris Sale, Donny?
What about him?
Chris Sale has tied the MLB record for consecutive appearances with 10+ Strikeouts.
Oh yeah. I saw that on the Sports report yesterday.
Struck out 4 of his final 5 hitters to get it, I can't believe it!
He was in the 6th inning with the pitch count heading toward 100 and just 6 strikeouts.I thought for sure the streak would end but the absolute madman did it.
He has got to be the best pitcher in the AL by a lot.
He tied the record he had already tied in 2015.
This is the second 8 straight 10+ K streak he's had. Unreal.
Correction, he ties Pedro and himself. He had 8 consecutive 10K+ games in 2015 too.
But still.
I knew he would do great in the AL east.
Sure the offense is potent on teams but so are the strikeouts.
I hope he can win a Cy young award.
And the fact that he doesn't mess around on the mound. Just gets the ball back, says yes to the first sign his catcher puts down.
And fires nothing but strikes.
MLB needs to use him as the example of game pace.
He's really, really good.
The best strikeout Pitcher since Randy Johnson.
Chris Sale is actually very reminiscent of Johnson. Huge/tall guy with no weight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who has the best grass in baseball?
The Dodgers, why?
I was reading this sports magazine and it had Yankees as the best.
We all no that not true.
Have you been to other stadiums.
I've been to a few.
Which ones.
Dodger Stadium, angles Stadium, giants stadium
You?
Just a few my self.
Which was your favorite?
I have none. I just love baseball.
Ok, if you could see a game which place would it be.
Old Detroit stadium.
That would be cool.
How about you?
Cubs Stadium.
You don't even know the mane.
What is it?
Wrigley field
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Indians game last night?
I didn't, but I heard about it today on ESPN!
You should of saw it, Kluber struck out 15 and was unhittable.
Really? At least he finally got some run support.
Yeah, Santana hit a homerun and two doubles.
He always seems to hit the Royals well.
Well if he can stay healthy, I think the middle of the order is set for the Tribe.
Yup, it was good that they let Napoli walk in the offseason, or else they might need another bat.
Do you think that the Indians will win the Central?
I do. There isn't another strong team in the division this year.
Well, if they make it back to the Series, they might not be seeing the Cubs this year.
Nope! They look lost after last year.
One of the strengths of this Cleveland team is their bullpen.
It sure is. Miller hasn't even given up a run yet this year!
The way Francona manages this team is the best I've seen since Mike Hargrove.
Not even close, Francona is the best manager Cleveland has had in my lifetime.
Who is pitching tonight for the Tribe?
It's supposed to be Tomlin.
Good. He has had a pretty decent year so far.
I know. I'm going to the bar to watch it tonight. Go Tribe!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where would you put the Phillies in terms of how many years away they are?
They havent shown much progress this year so 3 years.
Thats a while to make a fanbase wait
Theyve been patient before
The problem is they have no pitching.
I havent seen much from their hitting either
Thats another spot I thought we would see something
Do you think they have issues with their bullpen?
Yes but that can be easily fixed
How?
Slide some of those starters into the pen
That would hamper the starting pitching though
And those guys have not been good
I think Aaron Nola is a reliver in the making
Yeah he cant stay healthy
So make him throw one inning a game if that
Thats not a bad idea
And then you put Velasquez as the closer
Hes got the heat to do that
Exactly it makes so much sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is America's favorite pass time?
Baseball of course!
It's always good to go out and see a game, what's your favorite team?
Probably the KC royals.
Oh yeah? They were champions in what, 2015?
Yeah. They did really well that year. The year of the MOOSE!
Haha, yeah. All the chanting.
They haven't done as great, but they are still a solid team.
And really, staying loyal is what keeps teams like that solid.
True, not every year is going to be a championship.
Speaking of which, seems the curse is broken on the Cubs!
Yeah go Chicago! That was so close!
That was intense, really. Indians were so close to taking it home.
Cubs really deserved it though. Over a century and there it was.
I've a friend that is an Indian's fan, and she was not pleased in the least.
Oh, that's too bad. I was really rooting for the cubs myself.
I think people would still go to the games forever, it's just tradition.
It would be worth it forever! Having a home team that is close to your heart.
I think I'm ready for the next game now!
Go Royals!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you like to go to a ball game?
Which sport?
Baseball.
Definitley not!
Why?
I never really cared for the sport.
But it's America's favorite pasttime.
Not mine.
Any reason in particular.
It's so boring.
Have you ever seen a game live?
No.
You should give it a try.
OK. I'll tag along.
I'll buy you a hotdog and a beer.
You had me at beer!
You're such a loser!
I know. Ha!
Let's go!
Let me grab my jacket.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That was an impressive win by the Brewers against the Cubs.
Yeah the Brewers did a great job of taking over that game
That was a tough game to play in with all of the rain
I think Major League Baseball should have probably stopped the game a little sooner
Yeah the conditions were getting a little crazy out there
But to the Brewers' credit, they were resilient and found a way to get the win.
That's what good ball clubs do
I couldn't agree more. I mean it was 46 degrees out there and 37 degrees with the wind chill factored in.
Sounds more like football weather instead of baseball weather
Yeah the game was for almost 2 hours at the top of the 6th inning.
That is a long wait to try and complete a game.
It really is, but the Brewers are looking good. They have won 10 out of their last 12 games.
Yeah they got a great game from Orlando Arcia.
I believe he had 3 hits and a RBI
In contrast the Cubs pitchers were wild.
They walked 10 batters yesterday.
That's not going to win you a lot of games.
Even with that they were in a good position to win until reliever Mike Montgomery blew it.
Yeah he came in and immediately loaded the bases
The Cubs have Arrieta going tomorrow, so maybe they can right the ship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will we ever see a hitter hit 400 in a season?
I think the time to do it was the late 90s and it did not happen
Yeah I tend to agree with you because the pitching is so much better
But to counter my own argument, players are hitting alot better than they were.
I just think that its too hard to maintain it all year.
Hard to believe its that big of a deal to hit less than half the time.
Well its a tough game
You would have to go 2 for 3 almost every day because if you go 1 for 3 its still good but not near the 400 level you are aiming for.
I think its harder to hit for the triple crown
Its fun to watch guys get close.
Is there a stat youd like to see eliminated?
I think RBI.
What? Thats how baseball exists!
I just dont see how thats a stat though, you cant control guys getting on ahead of you.
Yeah but you can control whether they cross the dish
Thats true but still doesnt change the fact that you did nothing to get them on.
Sometimes thats not true
How?
Guy could be a terrilbe hitter so they walk players to get to him and then he hits a grand slam
That almost never happens
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did they use in the beginning?
What?
For the ball, they didn't have manufactured baseballs back in the days. So what did they use?
Depends no how far we go back. There have been many bat and ball games throughout the history.
In the US. For the game of baseball. What ball did they use, and how did they make it?
The earliest mentioning of the game was back in 1791 when they passs an ordinance banning the game within 80 yards from the town house.
How do you know that but not know what the ball was made of?
I didn't say I didn't know what the ball was made of, just that there have been many other bat and ball games.
in the US. the game of baseball. How was it made.
The very fist, recognizable, and recorded game of baseball was in the year 1846.
That's not telling me how it's made
I'm getting there. Like I said, there have been many bat and ball games everywhere. And the common method of making the ball included a rubber core, wrapped using yarn and leather
That's not too different from a modern baseball
No it really isn't, and it wasn't too uncommon for the leather covering to come apart upon being struck.
Hah, just like you see in cartoons.
Yep. It wasn't until 1850s in New York, that they tried to standardize the ball weight, size, etc. But it wasn't until 1876 that AG Spalding convinced the the National league to adopt his balls.
Spalding as in the sporting equipment guy?
Yep. he was a picther and pretty good one at that, and he happened to make his own balls, and thought that his was better than others, and the NL agreed, and the ball remained for the next century.
What happened n 1976?
The MLB decided to go with Rawlings, and that's why we have Rawlings logo on the balls and that's why.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where does baseball go from here?
Thats kind of a vague question, what do you mean?
Do they grow the game internationally?
I think its predominantly Latin right now
Yeah but can you see Mexico getting a baseball team?
I dont know about that, theyre a poor country
They love baseball though.
Players would have a tough time finding a place to live.
Well you just need a hotel for most of the time.
True, I just dont see them thinking thats the direction they want to go in
Do you think another expansion team will come into play?
I think they need to fix something.
I dont like the interleague play at all.
I think its ruined the sanctity of the game.
They should never have moved Houston to the AL West.
I agree, they didnt think that through
Heres the thing I bet they did
And thats the best  they  came up with?
Sure, they arent the brightest minds
How can you even say that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game last night?
Yeah.
Who would of known that both teams would have a no hitter.
I wanted shilling  to get his first. You?
I wanted arias to get his first.
That would of been a good one for him since he is so young.
Did you know this is his second season?
Yeah and he's only 22.
No way,I thought he was 26/27.
No man, he's 22 and he came from Mexico at the age of 21.
Wow, and he got his first no hitter last night.
I know, what a good career started for him.
I hope they don't trade him.
Me too, but you know how management is.
I know, they don't long at long term.
What ever happened to the days when a player would stay with a team thief whole career.
How do you thing shilling felt after his loss to that kid?
I wouldn't think he would be upset, but it's so hard to get that far with no hits.
Either way, it was a good game.
You watching tonight?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who will win the American League East this year?
Yankees or Red Sox like usual.
The Yankees play well at home, but who knows how it'll play out over the course of a season.
Baltimore isn't terrible either. Don't know if the pitching is up to par.
That's why I don't discount the Red Sox, they have quality starting pitching.
True. And the SP available at the trade deadline this season looks pretty underwhelming.
What happened to Toronto? They are under-performing.
They're a little banged up so they got out of the starting block slow.
If they can turn it around and have Stroman carry the rotation they could be back in it.
Yeah, but they could easily slide back and have an uphill climb just to play catch up.
I hate to say it, but the Yankees made really good moves-not just throwing money around.
They did get younger really quick. Their prospects like Bird, Judge, and Sanchez have really flourished.
It's not murderer's row, but you're right. They traded Chapman then re-signed him, now they have the prospects and Chapman back
They built a lot of those deals with the Cubs.
The Chapman deal plus the Castro one, too. Cubs spreading the wealth.
Who has a better young core? The Yankees or Red Sox?
Tough to say, but Bogaerts, Betts, Benitendi are a solid counter.
Yeah, I think that group with Sale throwing is trouble for everyone else.
They'll be battling for years to come carrying on the rivalry.
Absolutely. It never ends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where did the Tigers play baseball last night?
They were at home.
Who did they play?
They played Baltimore.
What's their record so far?
The Tigers?
No, the Orioles.
They were 23 and 15. Now, it's 23 and 16.
Oh, you mean they lost last night?
Yes, it was close though.
How close was that baseball game?
The final was 6 to 5.
Wow, you got to love baseball!
How so?
Baseball games are always close!
Yes, I love it when they go into extra innings.
Yes, it makes you feel like you got your money's worth.
I should hope so!
What do you mean?
Baseball games cost and arm and a leg to attend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's going on at the border?
Canada and America?
Yeah.
America's been doing surprisingly well.
Really?
Boston's been killing it hard.
Wow, Boston?
Yeah, I know.
Even New Brunswick?
That's a little much.
Boston killing Canada, nuts.
It's not so nuts.
They've got that new coach.
Roberts.
He's a nutter.
He's a good nutter.
He's an absurdly good nutter.
He loves to be a good coach.
He's great at coaching.
Everyone loves him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the cubs game?
Oh yeah, It was great.
Did you see how they won the world series.
Yes, I was very happy that they won.
I think It was about time right.
I think so I mean It's been long over due.
I was at home when I flipped the TV and saw they were playing.
This was so cool I started watching and felt glad they would win.
That is nice I am so happy they won!
Well it's about time they won.
I know it took forever for them to win.
I can't believe it started to rain and it went into overtime.
What a world series.
I thought for sure the Indians would take it.
I know right I thought the same thing.
good thing they did not win.
Yeah, Go cubs you earned that victory.
Yes it was a well deserved trophy.
I love baseball season in the summer.
I like baseball quite a bit myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch Jeter's retirement ceremony tonight?
Yes, I'm definitely going to catch that.
Do you think he's the greatest Yankee of all time?
No, my vote goes for Mr. October -- Reggie Jackson.
Wow! He's my favorite Yankee too!
I knew I liked you.
Thanks! We should get together and watch the ceremony!
Yes, that sounds like a lot of fun. We could also catch the double header in the afternoon.
Oh, who are the boys playing?
The Astros. They just got into town.
Great! Let's head over to the stadium.
How soon can you be ready?
I'm ready now! What time does the baseball game start?
It's around 2pm. I think we can make it.
Yes, but I need to grab my mitt.
Yes, I would love to get a memento.
Have you caught a foul ball before?
No, it was a home run!
Wow! I bet that happens to us today!
Yes, today is turning into a great day. Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last Mets game?
The one in Arizona?
Yeah, the Wednesday game.
I did. They lost.
They've lost seven games in a row now.
That's pretty bad. Do you think the season is already over for them?
Nah, I think they have time to bounce back.
Maybe. Yoenis Cespedes comes back next week and that should help.
True. I think they have a few other key players out with injuries too.
Yup, Steven Matz and Seth Lugo should be back soon too.
Too many early season injuries, in my opinion. It really cost them.
Yeah and I heard Noah Syndergaard might not be back at all this season.
Has the coach said anything?
No, but a team official said they've deserved to lose these games. They aren't playing well.
It's weird that they're still managing to cling to second in scoring in the Major Leagues.
The games have had really high scores.
Yeah, they lost to the Brewers 11-9 last week.
Still, I have hope the team can turn it around.
Me too. There's a lot of talent on the Mets.
Once the core team is healthy and returns, I think they'll see better results.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you watch the KC and Rays game last night?
Yeah, I watched up to the seventh inning but it was still one to nothing.
Aw, that stinks; they started scoring in the eighth.  The Royals got five in the eighth.
Really! I can't believe that.  I watched the entire boring ball and missed the good stuff.
Vargas was throwing some heat!  I think the Rays only had three or four hits.
That guy is a beast!  His ERA might be below one pretty soon.
I think this might be the end of the Rays for this year.  They've lost six of the last nine games to bad teams.
I think you might be right.  The Royals are bad too and they whipped them easily.
I think the main issue is their bullpen.
Yeah, every game I watch they are in the game into the starting pitcher gets pulled and then they start getting shelled.
You been watching your boys, the Red Sox, a lot.
Yeah, I've been watching all their games.  I've been pretty dead at work, so I get the chance to watch them regularly.
Their game last night was pretty good, did you see that win over the Brewers?
No, I actually missed that.  I thought they'd win easily so I didn't make time for it.  Did they win easily?
No, not really.  It was tied up one to one going into the ninth inning.
What! That sucks, I hate I missed that game.  What happened in the ninth?
Boston got a couple guys on and Betts crushed a three run homer!
That sounds like an awesome game, I hate I missed it.  Who got the win for the Sox?
Kimbrel got the win.  I think he's two and O now.  It was a little rough though, because they brought in Feliz first but he could only get one out.
Man, I'm not missing any more of their games.  Go Sox!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Are you going to the ball game today?
Whose playing?
Seattle plays Baltimore today, but it's a double header!
What do you mean by double header?
Oh that means that they will play two games in a row on the same day.
Really? That sounds exhausting.
I know, but you get your money's worth as a fan!
I suppose that is right.  When does the game start?
The first game will begin at noon and the second game will follow.
Is there a break between games?
Yeah, there will be a short intermission for the field to be regrouped, but it won't be too long.
I don't know if I could spend the whole day at the park.
I know.  I always feel like a devoted fan when I attend a double header.
Can I just attend one game or do I have to go to both?
You can just come to one game.  When it comes to baseball games you can come and go as you please.
Going to a game does sound like fun, but I have some things to do this afternoon.
No worries. Complete you tasks and then give me a call.
Okay.
I plan on being at the ballpark all day!
Great! I'll catch up with you later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the movie 61*?
Yeah, that is a really good movie.  Its about Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle in 1961
The year both players made a run at the Babe Ruth home run record.
Sure, Thomas Jane played Mantle and Barry Pepper played Maris.  They did an awesome job and looked so much like them.
It was very historically accurate they even showed Roger smoking Camel unfiltered cigarettes.
I don't know how they got them to hit the ball so hard either.  The actors must have had to work hard on their playing skills.
That and some good editing and great camera work.  The other actors also did great performances.
They showed Whitey Ford always coming to the rescue of Mickey when he had too much to drink.  Some of the scenes were comical and others were a little sad.
Yeah the issue of Mickey abusing himself came up a few times and it was shown in a very realistic light.
Too bad neither Mickey or Roger lived to see the movie.  I bet they would have liked it, as it was done so well.
Yeah.  They even had Mrs. Babe Ruth in there giving out the MVP award to Roger at the start of the season.
Maris was somewhat of an under rated player.  He had two really good years at the plate and was just good the rest of the time.
He was an awesome fielder and good on the base paths.  He retired at a young age, about 33.  Died really young too
Yeah, he was a loner type and did not like the limelight.  He retired young after playing two years in St. Louis
They said he played his last year because the owner of the Cardinals agreed to set him up in the beer business.
Yeah, he was set up to have a job after baseball, smart move on his part.
Players were not paid much as compared to today back then they needed a second career.
Most of the guys probably blew a lot of the money they made on partying after the games.  Some invested though.
Yeah, they say Mrs. Babe Ruth tamed the Babe a bit and invested a lot of his money wisely so he would have something after his playing days ended.
It was a good thing for him as he spent his money like crazy just thinking about having a good time.  Mickey was a little like that too.  Good movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you shorten the regular season?
Yeah probably by about 20 games.
Why that many?
I think you need to end baseball by mid October.
It does go on far too long
Yeah start the playoffs around Labor Day.
That would be significant, you would have to change the trade deadline.
I just think for the amount of games played and playoff teams, its not needed.
What about the lost revenues?
Teams can change their business model and figure it out.
Maybe expand the playoffs?
If you do that then you are really negating the regular season
So how do you assume you can make the game better?
Well I am not trying to improve the game, just eliminate games we dont need.
People could argue that final weekend is important.
It can and could be but you gotta assume that theyd be just important early on.
I think they should expand benches.
Just hitters?
Yeah, teams should be able to carry 3 catchers.
Your logic is a bit flawed to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did they high school have their last ball game last night?
Yeah, I can't believe you missed it!
Yeah, I totally forgot about it.  How did they do?
We won.  By two points in the last inning.
In the last inning?  Was it tied until then?
Yeah, neither team had scored since the fifth.  We had been tied 4-4 for half the game.
Wow, so what happened?
Well, the other team had used their pitcher all game, and I guess he was worn out.
Oh, so that must have screwed them up.
Well, it ended up costed them the game.
Oh, what happened?
Well, first he threw a ball and beaned the batter.
Oh, that sucks.  Why didn't they take him out then?
I don't know, but then he walked the next batter.
So there were two guys on base?
Right.  Well, the pitcher lucked up and managed to strike out the next batter.
But there were still two on base with only one out, right?
Exactly.  They could have still switched him out.
But they didn't.
Nope.  And the next guy hit in both runners.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's a good thing you didn't get me those Yankees tickets for my birthday.
Why is that? Because they were so expensive?
No, because they lost!
Oh yeah, right, that was pretty brutal.
That's why I love the Astros. I think they're the best team in the league right now.
Better than the Yankees? You're a traitor to your team!
Haha. I think Carlos is great. Did you see that two-run home run he made?
Carlos who? Who are you talking about.
Carlos Correa, number one on the Astros
Oh yeah I saw the run but I forgot his name. Guess I better start paying attention to them though.
Yeah you should, they're gonna be contenders this year for sure.
They almost were contenders last year, but they had some bad luck.
Yeah Correa got a shoulder injury and was out for awhile.
I saw the way he dives for the ball, always lands right on his shoulder. That's very risky.
Jose Altuve is great too, he's their golden boy. But I think Correa is gonna outshine him eventually.
The game was rained out today. It was supposed to be a double header.
Yeah and it was Derek Jeter night too.
Traffic is gonna be chaos in the Bronx tonight!
That's another reason I'm glad we didn't get tickets this weekend.
Exactly, I'm not up for taking two hours to get out of the parking lot at the stadium after the game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Cardinals game on Wednesday?
Yeah, that was a tough loss.
I know!  They have been doing so well lately.  It kind of derailed them.
Yeah, they will bounce back tonight against the Giants though
I agree. They started off very rocky, but they are turning things around.
That they are.  Aren't they leading the Central right now
I believe so.  But I would have to check.
I honestly don't care who is leading the Central as long as it isn't the Cubs.
I know right?  They win 1 World Series in over 100 years and suddenly they have millions of fans!
Yeah, bandwagon fans at best.
Right?  Did you see the Reds troll them?
I saw that video, that was great.  I haven't laughed that hard in a while.
Me either!
Who do you have going for it all this year.
Well in the AL the Yankees are very dominate, as much as I hate to say it.  NL is a complete toss up, but it is still early.
Yeah I don't think the Yankees will stay this strong.
Me either, but who knows, it is very early in the season.  Ask me again after the All-Star Break.
I can do that.  You going to any games this year?
I have tickets to a few this year, what about you?
Nah, unless you have an extra ticket!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Atlanta Braves baseball stadium is amazing.
Did you know they have to turn off the waterfall in the outfield during the game?
I heard about that, I think the baseball rulebook would consider it a distraction.
Speaking of distractions, some players on the Mets don't like it when fans do the wave.
That's surprising, the wave is one the best parts of the game for the fans.
It can make a boring game more fun, but I think it upsets the players if the game is close.
Do you think Harper is going to have another MVP year?
I hope he does well, he has a lot of fans in Washington.
I haven't really taken to instant replay in baseball.
Me too, I find that it distracts from the integrity of the game.
Did you know that every instant replay is reviewed remotely by someone in New York City?
That's amazing, no wonder the reviews tend to take so long.
On a good note, Freddie Freeman is having another amazing year for the Braves.
If Freeman and Harper were on the same team, I'd be really excited.
The game has changed, players get shuffled around much more these days.
Yes, it's harder to really bond with a team and form a connection with the players.
Who do you think the World Series champions are going to be this year?
I think the Cubs are going to do it again, Epstein is genius general manager.
Epstein is an amazing general manager, I agree, first the Red Sox and now the Cubs.
I can definitely see him bringing that magic to the Milwaukee Brewers some day!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best center fielder of all time?
Mickey Mantle.
I was thinking it'd have to be him or Willie Mays.
You're right, that's a coin flip.
I'd even give the edge to Mays because he was a little better with the glove.
Both were great. Mays had the legs though.
Well, that's a common mistake people make. Mantle was actually the faster of the two, but Mays stole more bases in part to Mantle's injuries.
We can throw Ty Cobb into the mix too.
Another good one.
What about best CF for modern times?
That's a little easier probably.
Maybe have to go with Trout since he's very similar to a modern Mantle.
Trout is a machine, but still early in his career.
Then I think you have to go with Griffey without an argument.
Yeah, you're right I can't think of anyone close to Griff in the past 50 years.
You mean Andy Van Slyke isn't close?
Haha. Good player but noooooo.
Kirby Puckett and Beltran for modern guys, but they're not Griffey.
Always forget about Kirby, if he didn't have the eye thing he might have his numbers would have been even better.
Yeah, that's a shame it got cut short.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been to a ballgame recently?
Yeah, last week.
How was it?
It's the first time I've been since I was a kid. It was okay.
Did the Reds win?
No, they lost, but it was still a fun time.
I haven't been to many games since I was a kid too. I tried going recently, but it just didn't hold up.
It's definitely more comfortable to sit at home and watch.
Yeah, you don't have to pay for food and you can always see what's going on.
Not to mention you won't get rained on.
They could still call the game though.
It makes me wonder why they play in stadiums without roofs.
Yeah, it's not like someone is going to bounce a ball off the ceiling.
I suppose it would cost too much to upgrade current stadiums.
They would have to build new ones.
I'm surprised they can't, with what they charge for a hot dog.
Yeah, the cost to taste ratio is not good.
It's supposed to be sunny for the next game, though.
It doesn't matter. I'll be watching on TV.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been to a game lately?
Yeah, last week.why?
Have you noticed all the ads that the stadium has?
Yes,I have never seen so many.
Did you see the one with the cat?
No,I missed that one.where was that one?
It was in the reserve level by the hot dog stand.
Oh, missed it. Yeah there are way too many ads.
I counted 32 that I could see from my seat.
Wow,I realize they had a lot, but bit that many.
I wonder how much they get.
Well they are paying for Kershaw,etiher,Jensen.
That is a lot of player with high pay.
We are one of the teams paying top dollar.
Why can't they just have a flat rate for all the players.
That would make it fare, but money talks.
Who's getting paid the most?
I don't want to find out.
I know what you mean.
I guess that's why there are so many ads and parking is expensive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Baseball sure is a slow game. I don't recall it being so slow as a kid.
Yeah, it is a lot slower than it was, say, 20-30 years ago.
I wonder why that is?
I think, in part, it is due to the use of so many more specialist relievers.
What do you mean? How would that slow down the game.
Well, if you bring many more relievers into a game mid-inning, then they have to warm up and come in from the bullpen.
Oh, yeah, that would slow down the game. Why else is the game slower now than it used to be?
Well, also you have to factor in reviewing questionable plays and the time that takes.
Yeah, but they have cut down that review time.
And, advertisements between innings are a little longer on average then they used to be 30 years ago.
All of this adds up to a much longer game and given this attention deficit-type of society, I can't see baseball being around much longer.
Well, I don't know about that, but there are a few other ways they can speed up the game.
Like what?
Well, they could have advertisements only at the end of innings, not mid-inning.
I can't see that happen. The more revenue streams for broadcasts, the better. There not going to reduce their revenue.
Maybe that's true, but there's not really a way to enforce a quicker game as the game is played today.
Maybe it's the sports fan that has to adjust to devoting three-and-a-half hours to a game.
There's something to be said for that. Baseball is a past time, so we should take time out from our busy lives.
Who knows. It may be that they get rid of baserunning altogether, shaving game times by 30 minutes or so.
Only time will tell.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite team?
I'm a die-hard Cardinals fan.
Did you grow up in St. Louis?
I lived there when I was a kid and my family went to games every summer.
How have the Cardinals been doing this year?
They're tied for first with the Cubs.
How does that sit with you?
I don't get in to baseball rivalries.
Do you think the Cardinals will make the playoffs?
The do almost every year.
What about this year?
They have good hitting.
Do you think their defense is any good?
They seems to be giving up a lot of runs.
What do you think they can do?
They need to get some new blood on the pitcher's mound.
What about their manager?
He's doing fine except that he could shake things up a little bit.
Do you think they can go all the way?
The Cardinals will be in the World Series for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Giants and Mets yesterday?
Yes, it was on really early on the West Coast, but I was able to watch it online at work.
Wow, that's some dedication you have.
Well, I am a fan of the Giants, and work wasn't too busy.
Can you believe the Giants were able to come back in the 9th inning like that?
No, I was really surprised.  They have been on a horrible losing streak.
Yea, the Giants have looked really bad lately.  What is going on?
Well they have had some key injuries, and some of their free agent signings aren't working out.
True, it's quite a shame what happened to Bumgarner and how he got injured.
Yes, but I mean the Mets are in the same boat.
That is true.  Giants and Mets met in the playoffs last season, and this year they both look like they've regressed.
Well the Mets had a really promising pitching rotation.  But injuries have really hurt them.
Harvey, Syndegaard.  Yea, you are right.
For a while there the Mets looked like they were going to be a dynasty.
Yes, and now, all bets are off.  They just can't keep their pitchers healthy.
What happened to Matt Harvey is such a shock.  He looked destined to be the next big star.
This is true.  Well at least the Giants won 3 World Series already, right?
Yes.  Our fanbase can't complain too much when we've done so well in this decade.
Yea, I think the Giants are due for some bad years.
Well I wouldn't go that far.  But yea, there is that fear that the window might be closed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tribe play tonight?
nah, they were off
good, they could use the break
yeah, hitting's been a little off, even as the pitching's getting better
bullpen's been great though
oh yeah, maybe best in the league, definitely is the best in the division
you think they're still good?
man listen, the twins ain't hanging around much longer
tigers neither, I really think by the end of june, they'll be just battling for home field
yep, me too
hopefully the fans start showing up a little more now that the weather's getting better
they've never really shown up though
well, in the 90's...
and early 2000's sure, but that was a different era
different team, different fans?
nah, same fans, just different priorities
yeah probably, any way, I had these off days
yeah, nothing to do at 7pm!
I actually went to buy tickets last night and realized they were leaving for the road trip
boo! next time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Phillies game yesterday?
Yes, it was terrific.
Wow, what happened?
The pitcher threw a no-hitter.
Wow, that's so cool!
How did he manage to do that?
He was throwing over 100 miles an hour on some pitches.
He must be great!
He sure is.
Was he a veteran?
No, what is amazing is that he is a rookie.
That's unheard of.
Yes, he was terrific in college and the minors.
He must have put on a show!
Yea, the crowd was going wild.
Even the greatest Cubs players couldn't get a hit?
Yep, their top hitter was struck out.
Wow, that is so cool.
I wish the Phillies keep up on this winning streak.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the a baseball had 88 stitches on it.
No I didn't know that.
That's a piece of baseball knowledge.
So why 88?
I really don't know why, but it's 88.
I noticed that it's always red stitching.
Yeah, so that the player can see the ball better.
That makes sense.
Also, did you know they cover the ball in mud.
No they don't.
Yes they do.
Why?
It's so that the ball dosent slip out of their hand.
Did you have a pro ball?
Yup,I have 2
Can you rub the dirt off?
I sure I can, but why.
Just skiing
Want to hold it?
Sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Jose Batista get hit while up to bat last night?
No.  And I thought that is only a controversy when he's playing the Baltimore Orioles.
Yes!  It usually is.  In fact he is playing them tonight; we should watch the game.
I wonder if there is anything brewing between those two teams this year.
Yeah.  There always is.  I wouldn't be surprised if he gets hit between the letters first pitch!
Well, you have to remember they will be more focused on winning then anything.
You never know.  People are people and when they hold grudges, I think that might trump the game.
Not when millions of dollars are on the line!
That's true.  Who is favored anyway?
I think the Orioles have a better record, but have been in a bit of a slide lately.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I wouldn't be surprised if Toronto took it to them tonight.
Me either.  What time is the game?
I think first pitch is at 7:05pm.
Who is pitching for the Orioles?
I'm not sure, possibly Dillon Bundy?
He's a pretty decent pitcher.
He more the decent.  He is the ace of their staff right now.
Sorry, I forgot Tillman is still down.
Yeah, until he gets his body and mind right again, Bundy is the ace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Afternoon.
Afternoon.
Do you enjoy baseball?
I do.  you?
Yep, one of my favorite sports.
I like baseball, but it's not my favorite sport.
Do you have a favorite team?
I like the Nationals.
Oh okay, you from there?
No, but I moved here for work.
That's cool.  I like DC.
Yeah great city.
How are they doing this year?
Not bad, starting off okay.
That's good.
What about you?
I like the Mariners.
Oh okay.
Good chatting
you too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Brewers are now in first place?
No, I didn't.  That's crazy!
Yes, they were supposed to be terrible this year.
All their players are young and unknown.
They are now 24-18.
Wow!
They have been hitting a lot of home runs, but their pitching still isn't great.
They still have Ryan Braun, right?
Yes, but he is actually hurt right now.
Really? And they are still doing that well?
Yes. It will be interesting to see if they can keep it up.
Baseball is a very long season.
Hopefully they will at least be in contention at the end.
Yes, that would be fun.
It makes the games much better to watch at the end.
I should start paying more attention to the Brewers now, I guess.
Yes you should.
Going into the season there was so much negativity I just figured they were going to be really bad.
Yes, not many people had confidence in this team.
Go Brewers go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think analytics is ruining the game?
No I think it improves it immensely.
Now they are devaluing closers.
And thats the way it should have went
How so?
They put too much emphasis on getting 3 outs in the 9th.
I guess so
Think about it, isnt it important to get the meat of the lineup out?
Always
OK so if they appear in the 8th dont you want your best reliever pitching to them
I am seeing your point.
And then go ahead and  throw whomever in the lineup
So what stat would you use to determine the value of a reliver
Inherited runners scored.
Thats a good stat
But then again so is holds.
I think thats the same thing as a save essentialy.
Yeah its not conclusive but it is what it is
I think we need to stop focusing on stats.
Baseball is all about the numbers
XXXXXXXXXXX
LOOKS LIKE THE CUBBIES WILL WIN ANOTHER WORLD SERIES THIS YEAR
YEP THEY ARE LOOKING STRONG ESPECIALLY THE PITCHERS
RIZZO IS HITTING LIKE MICKEY MANTLE TOO.
HAHA I AGREE GOOD THING THEY TRADED FOR HIM
PLUS JOE MADDEN IS UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS MOTIVATING ALL THE PLAYERS.
YEP WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE HIM AS A MANAGER
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE PITCHING STAFF?
I THINK THEY WILL HOLD UP ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE GOOD RELIEF PITCHERS.
I AGREE WE HAVE A VERY VERSATILE PITCHING STAFF.
YEP PLUS OUR STARTING PITCHERS ARE THE BEST IN THE MAJORS.
YEP PLUS I LOVE HOW OUR HITTERS ARE NOT ONLY GOOD HITTERS BUT FAST ON THE BASE PATHS.
YEP WE WILL STEAL OVER 200 BASES THIS YEAR.
I AGREE WE GOT THIS.
HAHA ITS NICE TO BE A CUB FAN.
FOR SURE ITS BETTER THAN BEING A WHITE SOX FAN.
HAHA PLUS WE GOT THE BEST FIELD IN WRIGLEY.
YES NO MORE 100 YEAR WAITS FOR THE NEXT CHAMPIONSHIP.
AS LONG AS WE STICK TOGETHER WE WILL BE A GREAT TEAM
OK LETS CHAT AGAIN SOON ABOUT GOING TO A GAME NEXT WEEK.
SOUNDS GOOD LETS GET SOME GREAT SEATS. TAKE CARE BROTHER
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think will win the AL West?
The Astros will this year.
Are you an Astros fan?
No. I root for the rangers
They won it last year
They won the last two years
You don't think they will win this year?
No, They were in last place at one point. They just don't have the hitters in their lineup.
They Astros I know has some good hitters
Yeah they are also the best team in baseball.
Jose Altuve is really good
Yeah. I think he is an all star I just hope the Rangers make it to the wild card
Do you think the Astros have a shot at winning the world series?
It is too early to tell. They would have to make a good trade too.
Yeah they may need another pitcher.
Yeah if they could get an ace pitcher that would make them a lot better
Who is your favorite Rangers player?
Elvis Andrus without a doubt. I also like Mike Napoli
Elvis has been around for a while
He has. He is a great shortstop not much gets by him and he is starting to hit better too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did the world series begin anyway? It's so stupid. Oh gee, look. We're gonna play for the world Championship. Oh, look, only the Americans are playing.
just about everything you ask is way to overgeneralized. You really can't pick one single game as the start of the world series.
Ok Fine then. What can be considered somewhat like a world series where multiple leagues played for one title?
If that's what you meant, then, the original world series should be the post season competition between the American Association and the National League.
Ok, now we're getting somewhere.
yes. And this game was initially called the "The Championship of the United States," or the "World's Championship series."
Now that sounds like the world series.
And it was called that, for short. The first game was played in 1884, between the Providence Grays vs New York Metropolitans
These teams are not even around anymore.
Well, New York Metropolitans is called the New York Mets now. And the MLB didn't exist until 1903, which is most commonly referred to year as the year when the first World Series was played
Who played in that?
Boston Americans vs Pittsburg Pirates.
let me guess. Boston Americans became the Red Sox?
Yep.
Did Pirates win any world series?
Yep, They won the first inaugural series in 1903, and then a few more after that, and the last one they won was back in 1979
What's the deal was that shoeless Joe guy?
Black Sox Scandal. Shoeless Joe was an outfielder for the Chicago White Sox. And he and 8 other players were accused of fixing the world series to make some money from the gamblers at the time.
Did he do it? Did all 8 do it? All guilty?
Well, Chicago White Sox wouldn't win a world series until 2005. They call it the Curse of the Black Sox. Shoeless joe had a home run in the series, perfect fielding stats with no errors, had the highest batting average of 3.75 in the series. Yet he was banned from baseball for life along with the other 8. His records from the series show that he didn't throw the game. Thus the curse.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey whats chilling i am at the cubs game and it is pretty chill.
Your at a cubs game no way how?
I won some tickets and i have been dying to go to a game this season.
Yeah i am definitely jealous of you.
You should stop by  maybe get a ticket.
Nah i cannot afford that how is the game going currently
Currently the score is pretty intense
How intense is it.
Every oufield guy is picking it up like mines and giving them no time it is a riot.
I hate to miss that.
Yeah it is pretty good and their are still over 5 innings left.
Well at least they are doing well i planned to record the game tonight so i can watch it later.
That was my plan but i got this and i actually got a ball  that got hit into the stand
You gotta get Perez to sign it.
I did not think about that but that is an excellent idea.
You should also get Michaels to sign it too
Multiple signatures would be awesome
It would also make a good souvenir for the baseball collection.
I do need to get more memorbillia for baseball and this is a perfect start.
Exactly and it will be a unique item in your collection.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Yankees fans?
Yes, I love the Yankees.
Do you think they are going to win the world series thin year?
I'm not sure, it's too early to tell, but they are looking good this year.
Do you like the new star on the Yankees that is hitting all those homeruns?
Who Aaron?
Yes Aaron Judge, that guy is huge.
Yeah, isn't he like 6'7?
Do think Aaron will be the homerun King this year?
Maybe, that man can hit the ball hard!
Do you think he is the next Derrick Jeter?
No, no one can replace Jeter.
What other teams do you like?
I like the Mets.
So you are a Yankee and a Met fan, you must love the subway series.
Yeah, I do I root for both teams.
Do you attend live games?
No, I like to watch the games in sports bars.
The Yankees are going to win it this year, I can feel it.
Yeah, I hope they do NYC needs a win!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Cubs vs Yankees game?
No, I'm not a Cubs or Yankees fan.
What team do you like?
I'm a St. Louis Cardinals fan.
Why are you a Cards fan?
I was a huge Mark McGwire fan during the homerun chase.
Do you think him and Sammy Sosa should be in the hall of fame?
Of course they should.  Everyone in baseball is on steroids.
Who is your favorite all time Cardinal player?
That's easy the Wizard Ozzy Smith.
Man Ozzy Smith was a beast on RBI baseball.
I loved RBI baseball.  Good times.
I use to play as the Oakland A's.
They had McGwire and Conseco didn't they?
Oh yeah and Dennis Eckersly.
Eckersly threw sidearmed.
Eckersly had one sweet moustache for a baseball player.
I also like Rickey Henderson.
Did you know Ricky played until he was like 40?
Yeah, I think he retired with the Yankees.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been to any baseball games recently?
No, I haven't gone since i was a kid.
I always loved going to games with my dad.
Yeah, those were good times.
There was a certain excitement to seeing your favorite players, even if if was from far away.
Sitting in a large stadium you could feel the energy and excitement in the air.
Did you ever eat any ballpark food?
Yeah, I would get cotton candy and hot dogs.
They were overpriced, but my dad would buy them anyway.
I haven't had ballpark food in years, but I'm sure the smell and taste would come back to me if I was around it now.
Did you ever catch any foul balls?
No, but came close a couple of times.
Did you see any homeruns?
A few.
One Reds game I went to, a player hit a homerun and batted in two other players.
That must have been pretty cool.
It was.
Do you watch the Reds on TV?
Yes, sometimes. When they're on a losing streak i'm not so inclined to watch.
Yeah, why do that to yourself?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the Phillies lately?
Yeah they havent played well.
They are young though.
I know but I want to see progress.
Wont see it from Mikael Franco.
He looks like he has issues.
He has a loose swing.
Hitting coach needs to clean that up.
They brought in Matt Stairs.
He was more of a power hitter. Not for average.
Yeah but the hitting has improved somewhat.
Pitching never looked great to begin with.
They have a history of not developing pitchers.
They put Jake Thompson in the pen.
Thats a head scratcher. Thought he was their ace.
They dont know what theyre doing.
Probably waiting to see how everyone develops.
Yeah they have promise, just gotta figure it out.
Hopefully sooner before the fanbase turns.
Theyll wait it out. They always do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's your favorite Major League Baseball team?
I'm from Boston, so I love the Red Sox.
Me too! Did you watch last night's game?
Sure did. I'm glad they finally beat the Yankees.
They're still third in the division, but it's going to be close all year.
Yeah, it's a good thing the season is so long. Who's starting the game tomorrow?
I think Chris Sale is pitching tomorrow.
Perfect, he's the best pitcher in the league right now.
He is, and the batting lineup is starting to get hot as well.
I know, can you believe that home-run that Mookie Betts hit?
The ball must have went over 400 feet. Did it go out of the park?
I think it did. What an incredible hit.
Did you see the stolen base in the 6th inning?
I did! I wasn't sure it was possible for a person to run that fast.
Have you ever been to Fenway Park for a game?
No, but I'd definitely like to visit there, because it's one of the oldest stadiums in the league.
I went to a playoff game last year. I hope the Red Sox make the playoffs this year.
Me too, and I especially hope that the Yankees don't make the playoffs.
Here's my number, let's meet up to watch tomorrow night's game together?
Thanks, I think the game's at 7. Go Red Sox!
XXXXXXXXXXX
MLB clubs had a total revenue of over $10 billion last year.
That's a lot of omney
More money than we will ever see, dream, or do anything with .
Oh I can dream.
But more than what we know what to do with.
Maybe.
See, how much do these players make tops?
Every year? or over their careers?
I don't know. Whichever. What do they make? Who's the highest paid baseball player over his career?
Alex Rodriguez. He made over 399 million over his career. So since 1994, that's 22 years, so that's like 18 mill a year
That's gotta be nice.
To imagine. Play the game you love. get paid 18 mil a year for that
That's nice.
That's an understatement. That's fantastic. That's the dream life for many. It's the American dream. Too bad he's a an immigrant from Dominican Republic, wait. that make it even more of the American Dream
NO he was born in New York, but moved to Dominican Republic when he was young.
Is that right?
yep
But he didn't get 18 mil every year, he started with 2.3 mill at Mariners.
Back in 1994, what's that worth now?
It's about 3,85 mill. Still respectable even to this date.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see that LSU won the SEC West championship?
No I didn't! I watched the games last weekend though.
Yeah it was great game man. This is LSU's 19th division crown.
Isn't LSU 20-9 in SEC play?
Yes they are, and if they beat Mississippi State later today I think LSU is tied to win the SEC overall championship.
What's a stake for LSU?
Florida has to lose to Kentucky for LSU to be SEC champions.
Oh man I really hope Coach Paul Mainieri can pull out this win for LSU, they really need it.
I agree, Jared Poche pitched really good yesterday.
Poche is going to need to be on his A game today though.
Especially since today's game is the last game of the regular season.
Dude if LSU doesn't win the College World Series this year something's going to have to done about Paul Mainieri.
As much as I hate to say it, I agree. LSU has been struggling the past few years.
Yeah I think Coach Mainieri is having a tough time coaching in Skip Bertman's shadow.
It's tough to say but season after season LSU clinches the top seed in regular season play but they end up flaking when it's time for the College World Series.
I don't get it, I really don't. They without a doubt have some of the best talent in college baseball.
This is very true but I think this year may be their year.
Couldn't agree more. Kramer Robertson is going to be a top MLB draft pick next year.
I think Kramer Robertson is on par with being as good or better then the former LSU player Alex Bregman.
Woahh, I'll believe it when I see it man but I do love Kramer. He's a great shortstop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My son has a ball game tonight.
Oh, he's still playing?
Yeah, this is his fourth year.
What position is he playing this year?
They tried letting him pitch at the beginning of the season, but that didn't work out.
Oh, yeah?  Didn't go over well?
Well, he didn't do so bad, but there's another kid that does much better.
Oh, well where is he playing now?
He's in the outfield.
Does he like playing there?
Oh, he loves it, and he's actually a lot better in the outfield than he was pitching.
So it all worked out?
Oh, yeah.  He'd rather catch flies than worry about throwing strikes anyhow.
How is he batting?
Not bad at all.  He actually had a home run and a triple his last game.
Wow, it sounds like you've got a star on your hands!
Yeah, he's pretty talented to be honest.
It sounds like it!
I'm just glad that he gets a chance to spend time doing something he loves.
Yeah, it's great when kids love sports.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that no hitter last night?
I quit watching in the 8th, thought for sure he'd blow it.
Was crazy he actually was perfect through 7 but that one close pitch and he walked the pitcher of all people.
So what happened past the 8th?
The first batter up in the 9th, he actually hit  up on the shoulder...looked like he was done for...was his 111th pitch btw.
They left him in because of the no hitter?
Yeah so then, like he walked two more batters AND THEY STILL left him in with only a 1 run lead with the bases loaded.
Man thats crazy...seems like it wouldnt happen in modern era baseball.
The crazy thing was...the next batter...
yeah?
He had him in the hole at 3-1 and he got him to bite an up and a away fastball.
Lol, who swings there?
I know...then the next pitch was dead on the corner...I thought it was a ball til the replay with that plate thing.
Yeah?
Caught the corner just BARELY.
So then what?
It was all smooth sailing from there...he faced 7 and 8 from there, and they were being fanned all night.
So much for the ruined no hitter
Yeah...I was happy though...first one in months, and for once it was for my favorite team..
We'll give you that one *laughs*
XXXXXXXXXXX
I went to the game last night.
I was there to.
Did you get the give away?
Yeah
Did you like it?
Not really, why?
Just asking. What a game Kershaw pitched.
I thought one of his best.
I agree.
That guy had one of the best sinkers ever.
Don't forget about his curve.
If you had a chance to hit against him wild you?
Sure.won't you?
No I would be too afraid to get hit by his pitch.
I can't believe he went 8 innings with Pitt let's them get a hit.
A simple bloop single could do it.
I would not be surprised.
Why?
He looked tied.
Wouldn't thou bee after 87 pitched?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Good morning.
Morning.
How are you.
Well and you.
Not bad, you like baseball.
I love baseball.
Is it your favorite sport.
Yeah baseball and football.
Same here.
Do you have a team?
I like the Mets.
They look good this year.
Yeah, but our pitcher was just in a sort of scandal?
Oh really?
Yeah Matt Harvey.
What happened?
He showed up to a game late because he was partying too hard.
Dang.
Yeah you'd think with all that money they paid him he would show up.
True.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How excited do you get about the All Star game?
I think its the best in sports
I agree its always compettive
Baseball is such a one on one sport
Yeah the pitcher is always trying to get the hitter out
And the hitter wants to hit a homer off the best
You dont have that lazy play you see in other sports.
They didnt need to make it count in my opinion
Yeah that was the league really messing that up
I am glad they no longer made it have such big implications
I cant believe it took that long for it to happen
Baseball isnt as progressive as we think
I dont know how accurate that is
What makes you say that?
Because they introduced the world to analytics.
I think all the sports would have gotten there eventually.
I think you might be right but may be wrong.
Its tough to say to be honest, I think it could have went either way.
I wish they would get rid of the every team needs a rep rule
Yeah thats a bit stale as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Yankee's at all this weekend?
Yeah, they were supposed to play on Saturday but it got rained out.
When are they having the make-up game?
They actually had it the next day, on Sunday.
But didn't they already have a game scheduled on Sunday?
Yep, they ended up having a double header.
Wow, a double header on Mother's Day?
Not only that, it was Derek Jeter day.
Isn't he already retired?
Yeah, exactly.  They had a ceremony to retire his number.
How long ago did he retire?
About three years ago.  It was a long day of baseball, but it was really good.
What did they do for the ceremony?
Well, they actually gave him a stone in Monument Park.  His whole family was there and they gave him a plaque that was a mini-version of his Monument Park stone.
Wow, I did't realize he was that influential of a player.
Sure, he's up there now with all the greats.  Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle...
I know he was really well known, but was he actually that good?
Oh for sure!  He's their all-time leader in hits, at-bats and stolen bases.
I had no idea.  So did they win the games?
They won the first but lost the second.  It was pretty close at the end though, it looked like they were gonna come back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! Did you catch the Yankees and Mets game last night?
You know it! I never miss a Yankees game.
Oh, that's right you have season tickets don't you?
Yup! Right above the 1st baseline.
Wow, those sound like great seats! Did you catch any foul balls?
No, not this time. But I did catch a few Derek Jeter foul balls back in the day.
They did like to pitch him inside..Whens the next game?
The Yankees play the Rays tomorrow at home, I have an extra ticket if you'd like to come?
That would be awesome, I haven't been to a basbeball game in years!
Sweet, i'll pick you up at 330? Chris Archer is pitching!
330 sounds good to me. Oh no way! That's easily one of the best Ray's players!
Yeah, Archer is pretty great. DIdn't you play baseball in high school?
Yes sir, I played centerfield but I was never any good.
Oh hush, I bet you we're the star of your team! I play in a softball league if you ever want to swing the ol' bat again!
A softball team and Yankee's tickets?! You must be the nicest person ever.
I just have a love for the sport. Baseball is America's pastime.
Well, I gotta get home before the Cardinals game tonight. Thanks again for the invite!
Oh no problem, Good luck to the cardinals and say hi to your wife for me!
Sound's good! see you tomorrow for some baseball!
Have a Home Run of a night!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Like baseball?
Yeah I'm a fan I guess.
Any team you support?
I like the Padres.
oh okay.
How about you?
I like the Twins.
You think they have a shot this year?
I'm not sure.  They are starting out pretty mediocre.
Same with my team.
I would love to see the playoffs this year.
You and me booth.
Ever been to a game?
Yeah you?
Yeah, loved it.
same here.
Nice speaking with you.
and you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you coming over tonight to go to the game?
I don't know if I want to go.
Really?  It's the last one on the season!
Yeah, but they really haven't been doing well anyway.
I know what you mean, but it's the last game!
I'll think about it, but we're on the bad side of a losing streak and I really could care less.
Tonight might be different, we actually didn't bat bad last game.
I don't think one game of decent batting will make up for for eight games of horrible losses.
Not really, but we might see some good batting tonight and that might lead to a good game.
Who has the upper hand on pitching?
Our pitching staff is actually better by far, which is another reason you should come with me.
So they actually stand a chance to win?
Yeah, man!  Batting is up and their pitching is definately no match for ours.
What is the ERA of their starting pitcher?
Like seven point something.  He is horrible.
Wow, our guys will run all over him!
Yeah, and we have 3 guys who actually have a couple game hitting streak despite the losses.
Yeah, I guess it's not their fault we keep losing.
So you gonna come out?
Yeah, sounds  like it will be a great game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Royals have been terrible this year.
Yeah, they can't win many games.
Vargas is pitching well though.
Yeah he is.  Too bad Herrera is struggling.
Trying to watch the Royals is like watching paint dry.
Their offense is horrible
They don't need to worry about making the postseason.
No they might have to start trading away assets.
I heard Herrera is a prime trading prospect.
Yeah they should be able to get some good, young talent for him.
Yeah, they'll probably trade him to the damn Yankees!
The Yankees already have the best bullpen in baseball.
Who do you think wins the AL Central?
I bet the Indians.
Cleveland is good, but I think Detroit has a chance too.
The Tigers are too old and they aren't nearly as good.
Do you think the Indians can make it back to the World Series?
I do. I think they'll beat the Cubs this time.
No way, the Cubs are too good.
We'll see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello there.
Are you doing okay?
Yeah good you?
Not bad.
Baseball fan?
Yeah I like baseball.
Same here.  Who is your team?
I like the Braves.
I like the Mets.
The mets are okay.
Yeah they're doing alright this year.
Strong bullpen.
Yeah except they don't show up to the games?
How do you mean?
Harvey not showing up.
Oh I didn't hear about that.
Out late partying.
Man that is a bonehead move.
You're telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can anyone stop the Rangers right now?
Heck no! This team is on fire at the moment.
They beat the Tigers last night 5-3. 10 wins in a row!
They are smoking hot! DId you see how far Gallo's home run traveled?
Yeah 445 feet. He crushed that ball!
I didn't think that ball was ever coming down.
Mike Napoli also hit a home run last night as well.
Yeah they are getting great production from their main guys.
They also got a good outing from Nick Martinez
Yeah he only gave up 1 unearned run over 5 innings.
Great hitting and good pitching is definitely a formula for success.
I agree. Though they did struggle a little bit to close out that game
Matt Bush was definitely making me nervous. I didn't know if he was going to survive.
He definitely had some tense moments out there
Yeah it was a good win though, but keep in mind Detroit didn't have Cabrera or Martinez in the lineup.
Yeah, but that's not the Rangers fault. You got to perform against whomever is out there.
Yep, you are right. At the end of the day a win is a win.
It sure is. Now it's going to be interesting to see if they can keep this streak going.
I think they will they have A.J. Girffin starting tomorrow. He's been a stud.
Yeah he is 4-0 trying to stay undefeated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey.
How's it going?
Not bad, yourself?
Not too bad.  You like baseball?
Yeah I like baseball okay.
Do you have a team near you?
Like an MLB team?
Yeah mlb, minors, whatever.
There's not really an mlb team near me.
Minors?
I think there is a farm team near us.
Have you ever gone to a game?
Never been to a game before.
Oh that's a shame they're fun.
Yeah that's what I hear.
Good to take the family to.
Yeah I should do that.
Good talking to you.
You as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really hope the Orioles can win the division this year.
Yeah it's going to be tough with the Yankees' resurgence this year.
But think about it. They are only a game and a half behind the yankees.
True. The Orioles have been playing pretty well this year.
I just hope they can keep it up. The yankees have really re-tooled their organization.
Yeah, but I would love to see David slay Goliath
This Orioles team is not a great hitting team, but they have their abundance of sluggers.
Yeah Chris Davis and Manny Machado are definitely dangerous hitters.
These guys can go yard at anytime.
In addition, Dylan Bundy has been pitching really well this year for them .
Yeah right now his ERA is under 3.00. And he has already accumulated 5 wins this year.
Yeah I didn't see that coming from him, but that's been a bonus
If he can keep that up throughout the year I give the Orioles a chance to take down the Yankees.
I don't know. It seems anytime they go up against the yankees they wet the bed.
True, but if they just play consistently throughout the year then they have a great chance.
I hope you're right because I cant' stand the Yankees.
Me too. But trust me it is not going to be easy. They are going to have to earn it.
They just need to play better on the road.
Yeah right now they are 13-3 at home but 3 games under .500 on the road.
yeah they are going to have to improve that record to win this division.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been keeping up with the games lately?
To some extent. You?
Yeah. I try to. I can't say for sure how the Rangers will do.
The Rangers! I remember their team from the early '90s, even.
Yeah? Rafael Palmeiro?
Sure. I don't recall them all.
They weren't bad. They're doing really well lately.
It helps to finally make a world series.
Yeah. That was one hell of a dry spell, wasn't it?
At least. People joke about Boston, but sheesh!
They have some quirky characters on their roster lately.
The one guy from Bolivia(I think) qualifies.
Sure. How many baseball players have huge pirate-style beards?
He's the only one coming to mind right now.
In all seriousness, though, maybe they'll have another chance soonish.
Maybe. I do like that they get by without a Steinbrenner type running the show.
How so? What about him do you mean?
I mean their success doesn't seem entirely dictated on who can afford the best players.
Simply because their owner's rich, right?
Exactly. That gets tiring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game last night between the Cubs and the Yankees?
Yes I did! It was such a close game.
I can't believe it lasted 18 innings, what a game!
Severino brought his A game for sure.
I know! Crazy! He pitched a velocity of 100.2 MPH.
Alot of sliders and fastballs...insane!
What about the Mets though, did you hear what happened?
No I didn't! What's up?
They suspended Matt Harvey three days without pay for an undisclosed violation of team rules.
Whoa! For real?? What did he do?
Apparently he was suspended after not showing up to the ballpark Saturday.
Oh yea, that'll get you. I wouldn't have done that if I were him.
Yea...it really took a hit on the team.
Yea! They were crushed by the Marlins right?? 7-0.
Ouch...just hearing that hurts my ears.
What about the Reds vs. Giants game??
Oh man, that game was interesting! The Reds outscored the Giants big time 27-5 last Friday and Saturday combined.
Yea, I thought that the Giants had a more hopeful future.
I agree. They've had the worst season NHL 11-21.
Definitely don't see a celebration in the near future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cant believe it man.
You can't Believe what?
The Spurs are looking so much better on the floor. With Kawhi Leonard out I thought for sure they'd lose.
Well they are the spurs afterall. Do you think they can take it all the way?
Yeah I do, Golden State looks good too but something about this Spurs team has me.
I don't know. Golden State looks like they're super hungry this year.
As long as Kawhi comes back and can play defense and Aldridge can have a solid game I think we have a good shot.
Cleveland may also be a nuissance to them before the warriors.
Yeah... I forgot about the cavaliers.
How can you forget Lebron James?
I feel like Kawhi is the new LBJ.
Youre crazy man.
It's always dangerous business underestimating the Spurs, as the Rockets just found out.
I mean yeah but cmon we are talking about two of the greatest teams.
San Antonio could be a challenge  to Golden State by winning the battle in the paint, and clearing boards.
Thats true with gasol and alridge.
Pretty much just need to focus on stopping steph and klay.
Kevin durant is still there.
Yeah KD is a different animal he can score on anyone, I just hope he has a few off days.
Keep hoping. Kd doesnt play like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
How are you?
Doing well you?
Not bad.  You a baseball fan?
I do like baseball.
You ever play?
I only played when I was a kid.
Yeah same here.
Do you have a team you like?
I like the Orioles.
I'm a fan of the Braves.
They aren't that great this year.
Yeah they are struggling.
Orioles look like they might be okay.
We'll see.
I hope we can make the playoffs this year.
Yeah they might can do that.
Good chat.
Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think it was worth the money for the Dodgers to pay 70 million for puige?
I don't any player should get that money.
Why do you say that?
It just seems like all these players are getting money and a lot of money to play baseball.
True, but I don't thing baseball would be the same if not for the money.
I think it would be better.
No. You have it wrong.
How?
That's how players would get paid off.
Paid off?
Yeah baseball games could be bought out to win or lose.
So that's why you say pay more?
I'm not saying that. It's just harder for player to get paid off.
You may have a point.
Pete rose is a perfect example.
Oh yes, the rose.
He did tarnish him self.
He was good.
That's why players get paid a lot.
Good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Good morning.
Morning.
Do you like baseball?
Yep, big fan.
Cool, same here.
Nice.
What's your favorite thing about the game?
That's a good question.
Take your time.
I think maybe because it was such a big part of my childhood.
Oh okay, like good memories?
Yeah, and also I played a little bit.
Oh, were you good?
No, not really, but it was the only sport I really played.
I played a bit myself.
Were you good?
Nope, terrible.
Well that makes two of us.
Good chatting.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever hit a home run?
Nope. I'd love that, though.
I did once.
Was it awesome?
People were screaming all over the place. It was pretty amazing.
I can imagine. When was it?
When I was in high school.
When you played for the Vipers?
Yes, that's right. Remember Julie and Ellen taking you to the games with them?
I do but I never saw you hit a homer. Trevor did, though.
It was one of the days they didn't go. I think you were all at the lake.
Sorry I missed that. I love how jazzed the crowd gets.
It's an intoxicating feeling for sure.
I always wanted to experience that for myself but I'm not any good. I didn't even make the team.
I remember that too.
Oh, well, we can't all be good at sports.
I'm actually thining of trying out for this new team Luther made up.
I'll come watch if you do.
The tryouts are next Saturday at one.
OK, we can ride together if you want.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
How are you.
Good you?
Great.
That's good to hear.  You into baseball?
I do follow it. you?
Yeah I like baseball.
Did you play?
Yeah I played a bit, you?
Yeah me too.  Did you play in high school?
No only little league.
Oh I see.
What about you?
Yeah played a bit in high school.
Were you good?
I was okay.
What position?
I played first base.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the highest rated major league baseball team of all time?
That would be the New York Yankees, of course.
I am not sure. The Yankees did have Babe Ruth, Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, and Lou Gehrig, but what about lately?
The Yankees have been in 27 world series.
I think the Yankees are great, but the Boston Red Sox are my favorite.
The Boston Red Sox are good and some of their best players have been Ted Williams, Wade Boggs, and Manny Ramirez.
What do you think about the Atlanta Braves?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened to Greg Bird?
What do you mean?
He was killing the ball but now he stinks.
He's had 60 at-bats. Relax.
I know it's early but he looks completely lost.
Compared to what? Like I said he's only had sixty ab's.
In spring training he was smoking the ball though, now it's not even the same swing.
Well spring training stats are worthless, everybody is just trying to shake the rust off and get going. Plus Bird got hurt.
Is it normal to struggle like this coming off an injury though, especially when it seemed like he had gotten it back?
Well you gotta remember he's young and didn't even really have a lot of minor league experience.
When he first came up to the majors he was hitting awesome.
Right, and then pitchers get to see you often and after a while they can figure you out. It's normal.
So you think it's just growing pains and adjusting?
To a degree, yes, and the injury complicates things. All in all he's still very green and will need time to mature.
I just want to see him mash again in that short porch.
Well the Yankees are generally young and going through it all. You have some guys really overperforming and then you have guys like bird trying to catch up.
You're right, I guess I should wait it out.
Count your blessings with Judge and those guys really turning it on, they're keeping the torch lit.
Got that right. I just bought some of his rookie cards.
Nice. Hope he keeps it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go see a ball game some time?
Ball game, like baseball?
Yeah. It would be pretty fun.
Aren't those game expensive though? And we'd have to go to the city.
Well we can see a minor league game.
Where do those team play?
There's a minor league team over in Somerset.
That could be fun I suppose.
It really is a good time even at the minor league level.
Well what do the tickets costs?
I am not sure, but I think no more than $12 usually.
That's not bad at all. I could go for that.
I have been to a few of their games in the last few years.
How did the team do?
I think they won most of the games I went to. Go Patriots!
Hahaha! Maybe I'll show up as a supporter of the other team for fun.
That may just cause a riot in the stands!
That doesn't scare me. As a die hard supporter of whatever the other team is, I will not be shaken.
I admire your dedication to the sport of baseball.
It truly is America's pastime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to watch the Yankees game tonight?
Why?  Because it is Derek Jeter night?
Yes.  I am not necessarily a fan of the Yankees, but I do want to watch to see how they honor him.
Yes, I guess I will be watching as well for that reason.
What are your thoughts on Derek Jeter's career?
I think it really stands out.  He's a legend on a team full of them.
Yes, I think no matter how you feel about the Yankees, you have to respect what Jeter did.
I agree.  He played twenty seasons for the most scrutinized team maybe in all of sports.
Exactly!  And honestly he never had a scandal or got in trouble for anything.
Yes, he did seem to conduct himself as a professional off the field.
And he was pretty good on the field as well.
Well the five World Series titles kind of speaks for itself.
Yes, and wining three straight.  I don't know if any team will do that again.
I think he just had the personality to fit in New York.
Yes.  He's a good looking guy, well-spoken, and always seemed to deal with the media very well.
Do you think he was the best short stop of his era?
I definitely think so.  I mean Alex Rodriguez was a short stop.
Yes, but ironically Rodriguez had to change positions when he came to the Yankees.
Well those two did not really get along.
Yes, it will be interested to see if Rodriguez is there tonight for Jeter's night.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Yankees and Red Sox?
I did! It was intense!
Sure was! How about that double play in the 2nd inning!
Oh man, I couldn't believe they almost let him score!
I guess that's what happens when you forget there is a runner on 3rd!
I guess, but how can you not remember there is a runner in scoring position.
I know, right! They almost had the game tied.
Good thing they got him out, the yankees don't do well when they get behind.
No they don't. Remember the last time they got behind in the 4th inning, spent the last 5 innings playing erratically.
So true, it's like they can't figure out where to throw the ball! The center fielder tries to make a play at home and doesn't use their cut-off man.
I know! It's like all fundamentals go out the window!
It's a good thing they beat the Red Sox this time, it will put them in the playoffs!
Playoffs are already coming around? Wow, that's crazy!
I know, I wish the season could last longer.
The guys need some rest though, they are getting up there in age.
Yeah, that makes me think of Derek Jeter, man I miss him!
Oh I know, he was the best 2nd baseman of all time!
That, and he was in general just a good guy.
I'm glad he mentored new players to be role models for today's youth.
Me too, my son has always looked up to him, and tries to act just like him. That is one pro athlete I am okay with him acting like.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What year did baseball start?
1846?
No, it's 1890
Wow, that was a long time ago.
Yup, do you know who many teams New York had in the 50's?
I think they had 6 teams.
I don't knew, that's why I'm asking you.
What?
Just kidding. The had five.
Can I guess which ones?
You'll never guess, but try.
The Dodgers, Mets, Yankees, and giants.
That's only 4.
That's all o could think of.
Your right, only 4.
You owe me dinner, buddy.
Fine, but only you.no body else.
Your sounding weird again.
We'll,I like talking alone with you. We could go on and on about baseball together.
That's true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Afternoon.
Hi.
What's happening?
Not much, you?
Same.  Are you a fan of baseball?
Yeah sure am.  You?
Yep, like baseball.
Did you ever play?
I played a little bit when I was a kid.  You?
Yeah I played up until high school.
Oh cool, you must have been good.
I was okay, but I grew up in a small town.
Oh I see.
Yeah there wasn't a big talent pool to choose from.
Do you watch a lot of baseball?
Yeah some, I'll catch a few games now and then.
Yeah I'm the say way.
Hard to catch a lot of games, so busy these days.
Bye.
Bye.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the scuffle between Joey Bats and the Braves?
Yeah I saw it, Jose getting into it again.
What do you think about his bat flip?
I think it was dumb of him to do when they were losing, but the Braves should not been butthurt about it.
The next game The Braves hit Joey in the thigh deliberately.
Well, I hope it angered Jose and motivated him to hit another dinger.
I agree with you, bro. Braves will continue to be wussies.
True. Every Brave except Bartolo haha.
Bartolo Colon truly is big sexy.
I hope he stays in the league forever.
Yeah, dude. We need to see him hit another bomb.
Hope he starts when the Braves come over to AT&T Park later this month.
Me too! I'm down to going if he pitches. You down as well?
Yep, definitely! Haven't been to a game all year!
Sweet. I'll hit you up if I hear any more about the series.
Hope Giants can turn things around fast.
Yep. They are really struggling.
The last series with the Reds and Dodgers wasn't bad though.
True. They've got the Cards coming up. You think they'll win the series?
They should be able to. Or else I will be disappointed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
How are you?
Not bad, you?
Doing okay.  Are you interested in baseball?
Yeah I like baseball.  How about yourself?
Yep, I'm a baseball nut.
Who do you like?  I mean like a team.
I'm a big Red Sox fan.
Oh okay Boston cool.
Yep.
Is that where you live?
I grew up there and moved away.  But I still like the Red Sox.
Yeah I get that.
What about you, favorite team?
I like the Dodgers.
Oh okay out west.
Yeah.
Good talking to you.
Bye.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Major League Baseball team right now?
I like the Chicago Cubs the best.
Were you happy when they won the World Series last year in 2016?
Of course! That was their first World Series win since 1908?
It was a great series.  I was surprised the Cleveland Indians did not win.
They are not doing very well this year.  The Indians are currently only second in the American League Central.
The best team in the American League right now is the Houston Astros.
Their pitching is excellent. Dallas Keuchel is off to a strong start!
He could win the American League Cy Young Award this year.
I think Ervin Santana has a chance too.
Who is the best pitcher in the National League right now?
I think Clayton Kershaw is.
True, but even with Kershaw, the Los Angeles Dodgers will not win the National League West division.
Only because the Colorado Rockies are so dominant right now.
Their offense is incredible. Mark Reynolds could be the National League MVP this year.
But Ryan Zimmerman is having a better season now.
I cannot wait to see the Rockies play the Nationals this year.
I think the Rockies and the Nationals will be finalists in the National League Playoffs.
And the winner will face Houston in the 2017 World Series.
I think the Rockies will play the Baltimore Orioles in the 2017 World Series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did yousee the reds ox game last night?
I did not, did you?
I did not either, I wanted to know if you knew the score. They are in Milwaukee right?
Yeah, playing the brewers.
Whats the name of the brewers stadium?
I'm not sure. I've never been.
How do you feel about the whole matt harvey thing?
I'm not really sure. It seemed weird that they suspended him like that. i don't know what he did.
Me either. He wasn't scheduled to pitch  that day.
Is he a starting pitcher?
I think so, for the mets.
How are the mets doing this season?
I think their team image is kind of suffering a bit with all this player drama.
I agree.
How do you feel about the racist comments that fenway fans made to jones the other night?
Totally horrible and uncalled for.
It makes me embarassed to eb a boston sports fan
I agree. I hate it.
At least fenway tried to make up for it.
How much can you really do though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they can speed the game up anymore?
Oh they definitely can soon.
I would like to see batters take pitches quicker.
That is the easiest route to take.
I would say once they get the ball back they have 10 seconds to throw it.
Yeah I would be OK with that.
And get rid of all the relief pitching changes.
I think thats a fine line they have to toe.
What do you mean by that?
Well who is to tell a manager who he can put it.
The problem is that takes 6 minutes sometimes to do.
Yeah just eliminate the warm up pitches on the mound.
Then theres advertising dollars that are lost
I dont think so because what if theres no changes.
True. Any more suggestions?
I would start there and go forward
I think you are on to something.
They may be able to reduce some times in other places but I am not sure what that would entail.
Trimming the roster?
That could be the way to stop with all the relievers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Braves fan?
Yes! There are a lot of us here since Nashville doesn't have a team.
Did you see the game last night against the Nationals?
I saw that. That was great!
I don't think anybody expected them to win.
I'm always optimistic, but I didn't really have a LOT of hope.
The Braves seem really good to me sometimes.  But their record is pretty bad.
Yeah.  I was starting to get worried they might get off to the terrible start they had last year.
I hope Freddie's hand heals quickly.
They said it's broken in several places.
But Peterson is doing okay at first.
I think so too.
Dansby really messed up that one play, but he redeemed himself.
I really pull for him because he went to Vanderbilt and I did too.
The pitcher R.A. Dickey is from Tennessee isn't he?
Yes, and he did okay last night.
Every time Bryce Harper comes up to bat I can only think about that commercial where the baseball bubbles are coming out of his nose.
Right! That commercial is hilarious!
They play again today at 3:00.
I'll be watching.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Astros-Yankees game yesterday?
Which one? They had to play two games due to bad weather this weekend.
The night game, the one that was broadcast on ESPN.
Yes, I did see that one, where Derek Jeter's number was retired.
The Yankees almost made a comeback, but still lost 10-7.
They must have, because when I watched it, the Astros were up 9-0.
That's because in large part to George Springer hitting two home runs.
Don't forget Bregman's grand slam.
That too, and that just spoiled the Yankees' night.
Yeah, but at least they won the first game of the doubleheader.
Didn't the Nationals and the Phillies have to play two yesterday also?
Yes. The bad weather was all over the northeast, causing many games to be postponed.
I saw that Bryce Harper hit a home run in the first game.
He hit the game winning home run Saturday night.
That kid is amazing. He's got one of the best batting averages right now.
And he is indeed still a kid. He's only 24 years old.
He might be in the hall of fame once his career is over.
I predict he will have at least 500 home runs in his career.
I think he'll have more than that, perhaps 600 or 650 home runs.
There are very few baseball players who have hit that many home runs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see CC Sabathia's last start? He was lights out.
I had to work late and missed the first half.  The second half was great.
Did Matt Harvey start last night?  I heard they won but didn't see who got the W.
Yeah, he went 5 innings.  He got lit up.  They went to the bullpen early.
Did you see the shot David Wright took last night?  I bet they are still looking for that ball!
That was a heck of a blast.  I think car windows in the parking lot got shattered.
Brett Gardener stole 2 bases again last night.  That boy can run!
I didn't see the game.  Sounds like I missed a good one.
Did you see the Derek Jeter retirement ceremony the other night?  I was crying.
The Yankees did a beautiful job, like always.  It was a very moving ceremony.
I love that Joe Girardi is still coaching the Yanks.  They really take care of their own.
That team always seems like a family to me.  It must be great to play for them.
Boy, I really love Aaron Judge!  Every time he comes up to bat, I hold my breath waiting to see if he hits a homer.
I really like him.  He is so aggressive at bat.  They found another good one.
Matt Holliday is a great player.  He makes up some much spade in the outfield.
He is so fast.  He gets to all those balls that I don't think he will.  He is really impressive.
Gary Sanchez caught a heck of a game last night.  I thought the ball was going to go right past him.
He made that tag at home too.  That guy should have been safe, but Sanchez put the glove in the right place.
Is Ben Heller pitching this weekend?  I want to go to a game and would really like to see him throw.
I am not sure, but would happy to look it up for you.  If you need someone to go with you, let me know.  I am free this weekend and would love to see the Yanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what about them A's?
What are the A's?
They are a baseball team, I think they are on the east coast.
OH the few teams I know are on the west coast.
What teams do you know?
I know of the dogers and the giants but I am sure there are more, they can't just play eachother.
Well that sure is true. There's the national and then reginoal teams.
Baseball is so difficult, how do they hit that ball.
I figure it is with lot's of practice and maybe some drugs.
I don't think they can use drugs while in a professional sport
So when was the last time you seen a game.
It has been a few weeks, I went down to the statium and saw the red sox play
How cool.
It was but sort of sucked I mean it was eight dollars for a beer.
Wow that is extortion
I know I don't know how they could charge so much, I thought beer and baseball really went hand and hand but at those prices
True, I wish it was more accessible to go to more games
Who would you want to see?
I would want to see the Giants or maybe the Dogers
Me too those are the best teams but they are rivals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Aaron Judge sure turned things around this year, didn't he?
Yeah he's the biggest thing in baseball this year.
He performed so poorly last season, I thought for sure he'd be sent back down to the minors.
I didn't think so. He was just young and nervous, coming in almost at the end of the season.
True. Remember when he finally almost got a run in, and he tripped at the last second?
Yeah that was awful for him. He hurt his ankle too if I remember correctly.
My heart broke for him.But you're right, he came back with a vengeance this year!
Well he probably had A-Rod mentoring him. He's bound to improve
He's a really big guy too.
Yeah 6'7". A guy like that is bound to be a powerful hitter. He could be team captain.
Well, the Yankees don't have team captains anymore.
They dpm
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how the Dodgers are doing this year?
They got off to a slow start, but they're slowly gaining momentum in the NL West.
They had the Rookie of the Year last year, didn't they?
Yeah, Corey Seager. And they have another bright prospect making news this year.
Is he any good or just a flash in the pan?
Yeah, he's tearing up the place... there's no way they're going to send him back to the minors now.
What's this rookie's name?
Cody Bellinger, and he's in line to replace Adrian Gonzalez at first base.
The kid must be really good to replace Gonzalez... what's he been doing lately?
He has five home runs in those 11 games, and just hit a grand slam against the Padres.
That's incredible! Do you think he's a Rookie of the Year candidate?
Most definitely. The Dodgers have a history of cranking out Rookies of the Year.
I remember in the 1990s they had five in a row.
Yeah, one of them was Mike Piazza, who just got elected to the Hall of Fame last year.
This could be the start of another streak for the Dodgers rookies.
No doubt... people criticize the team for buying high priced talent, but they've got quite a few farm players in their line up.
Anyone I've heard of?
Joc Pedersen, Yasiel Puig, and Corey Seager are all everyday players, not to mention Clayton Kershaw.
Kershaw is a pitching machine, isn't he?
No doubt... he'll lead the Dodgers to the World Series within the next three years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Boston's great.
They're okay.
I mean.
They're not great by any means.
They are.
I don't think that's the case.
I promise.
Come on.
They 're really, really active.
They're not so good.
They're like always clever.
They never do anything new.
They love to do new stuff.
Their midgame is still decades old.
Yeah, and?
It's boring.
It's perfect. Timeless.
It's dead. Rotting.
You hate good hockey.
I love it. That's why I hate Boston.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't baseball great?
Excuse me?
Oh, beg pardon, I was talking to my parrot.
That's weird. Your parrot a sports fan?
Thats none of your business.
My apologies. For what its worth, I like baseball!
Nobody asked you though.
Fair enough, I was just saying.
No, just ignore him. Two outs.
What was that?
Stop eavesdropping, I'm trying to have a conversation about baseball.
Does your parrot really understand english?
Clearly better than you do, did you hear when I told you to leave me alone?
Sorry, its just....a baseball loving talking parrot! Its fascinating.
Deal with it.
I can't, its rather remarkable really. Whats his name?
Babe Ruth.
Well ain't that something.
I'd say its a home run of a name.
I'd say you watch too much baseball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This kid Aaron judge is good. have you seen him?
No, who is that? who does play for?
the yankees! nothing like in the 90s though
he's a rookie then? when did he start?
This year dumbass! obviously if he's a rookie he started this year.
I'm sorry, I don't know too much about baseball, I'm only really thinking about networking
Fun times. anyway back to the Yankees. He's a right fielder, he smacks homers
how good is he? like is he powerful?
When he hits homers he knocks it into the restaurant outside. I'm not even playing.
is he a big dude? like tall?
Oh my god this dude is huge! he's like six foot seven
he hits a homer and they say "here comes the judge"
wow you must be talking about 400-500 foot home runs! is he a MVP?
He made rookie of the month. He has also has made most valuable player in some games recently.
the Yankees have a new young nucleus, a new young team they can build around
like jeter and them? some new young stars?
yeah, exactly like that! this is just what they need
they have been a little weak lately, so I'm glad to see this
hold on, don't disrespect the Yankees. I won't have that
I forget you are a true fan. My apologies to your people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of last night's Yankees Royals game?
I wasn't expecting the Royals pitcher to be so good.
Yeah, it was the pitcher on Wednesday who was supposed to be a problem for the Yankees.
And they really beat up on him.
The baby bombers are becoming the Bronx bashers!
One of those radio guys is calling them the Bash Brothers.
Too bad they couldn't score last night.
After the game Girardi said they were having trouble seeing the ball well. Duh!
Poor Montgomery. I guess it's tough when you're just starting out.
I think he's a decent pitcher. He has some wins, just has to get used to the pressure of the big league.
You know, speaking of pitchers, Sabathia was pretty impressive the other night.
He was awesome!
You never know with him.
Hard to make the transition from high speed thrower to finesse pitching.
I wonder if Petite has been giving him some lessons.
He's dealing with a lot, getting over his alcoholism, learning a different way to pitch. And just getting older.
I guess. Still making the big bucks though.
For sure. This is his last season with the Yankees. Hope he invested his money wisely.
Yeah. Say, who's pitching for the Yankees against Tampa tonight?
I don't know. Tanaka maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The bases are loaded.
I bet the Vipers will win.
It would be so awesome.
Marcus wants to win so badly and ever since he joined this team they haven't done so well.
I know. It's sad.
Oh, my gosh, a home run!
Look at Marcus run!
This game is so amazing. They are going to win. There's only a minute left of the game.
Marcus is going to be thrilled. He just made it home.
This is the best game I've ever seen.
Baseball normally bores me but this was awesome in the end.
I like it OK but you are right about this being one of the best games.
At first I thought the Asteroids would win but the Vipers took it in the end. Can you believe how sudden the turn was?
It was really crazy.
Marcus is coming over here.
Look at that grin.
Oh, he is so happy.
He also looks kind of tired.
Baseball is good exercise like other sports.
Maybe I should play a sport then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are the Cubs losing?
Almost nobody in the infield is playing up to expectations.
But Kris Bryant is having a stellar year.
He certainly is, but Rizzo and Swarber are really is a funk.
It is the sophomore jinx.
How about Theo Epstein, though(The Cubs General Manager)
He sure is a wunderkind.Speaking of Theo, how are my Red Sox doing?
I hear that Sale is outperforming expectations.
He sure is, amazing! He is leading the AL in strikeouts by a large margin.
That trade is working out.But, GM Dave Dombrokski also seems to have made some dubious moves.
Time will tell.Anderson Espinozo was NOT part of that trade.He is a top prospect.
I know, I was traded even up for that lefty.
I think you are referring to Drew Pomeranz. I think he is pitching alright.
Well, he may be "alright", but that is not good enough.
Yes, I agree, and David Price has yet to throw his first pitch of 2017.
They sure dodged a bullet there.Early reports indicted Tommy John surgery, with a return in mid 2018.
He really underperformed last year, even though he may have won around 17 games.
Well, that may be correct, but for 30 million a year, you need to pitch better than he did.
He easily could have won 20 games, the way the Sox hit behind him.
I know, and even though I always liked the guy, he threw a real stinker in last year;'s playoff appearance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Could you tell me who played the Cubs in the 2016 World Series?
Yes. It was the Cleveland Indians.
Didn't the Indians play in the World Series in recent years?
They last played in 1997 against the Florida Marlins and lost.
Seems like a long time since both the Cubs and Indians won a World Series.
Indeed. The Cubs last win prior to last year was in 1908, and Cleveland last won in 1948.
I recall the 2016 World Series went all the way to seven games.
That seventh game took extra innings to decide.
It took practically all night because of the extra innings, and there was a rain delay in addition.
When will the World Series start this year?
It is scheduled to begin October 24.
Who do you think will play in the World Series this year?
Maybe the Astros and Cubs, but its too early in the season to tell.
Have the Astros been to the World Series before?
They were once back in 2005 against the White Sox.
That's confusing because both are American League teams.
That's true now, but the Astros were in the National League back then.
Did the Astros win it that year?
No, the White Sox won it all.
So both of the Chicago MLB teams have now won the World Series in recent memory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will any pitcher come near Nolan Ryan's record for no hitters?
No way its untouchable.
We have seen an uptick in No Hitters lately.
But those are just isolated starts. Guys dont come near them.
Yeah I think its tough to throw them nowadays
Plus guys are singles hitters now
So you think the hitters have evolved?
Its just that theres more contact going on in baseball
But the power numbers are down.
Yeah and if pitchers dealt with that it means more flyouts.
So no one will break this record?
No, not in my mind. Just like DiMaggio's record.
It is amazing that no one has even come close to it.
Yeah its just too hard as well.
we are in a pitching era right now.
And that will end eventually because everything is cyclical
I think that we will see it turn quicker but who knows.
It goes without saying in my opinion
Its such a great sport with so many records.
But you do want to see them get broken
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, there are a few surprises going on in baseball this year.
Yes, I am surprised how poorly the Cubs are doing.
How about those Milwaukee Brewers.
Yes, as of today, they are actually leading their division.
I am not sure they will continue doing so well.
They seem to have the hitting but, pictching is not fantastic.
I think they have won 5 games in a row now.
Yes, I noticed they were actually a couple of games ahead of the Cubs.
Houston is another team that is surprising.
I noticed they have the best record in baseball.
I know they have a pretty good pitching staff.
There hitting is also very good.
Those in the know say they will last.
Would not surprise me.
I noticed the Dodgers are doing as well as everyone had predicted.
Yeah, I think they are only a couple of games above 500.
Who do you think is the best team in the American league?
For me it is a toss up between the Astros and the Yankees.
I am not crazy about the rule changed that just allows you to walk a batter intentionally just by letting the umpire know.
I don't like it either. Takes away from some of the excitement of throwing 4 balls without throwing a passed ball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Pirates have a chance at getting to the World Series this year?
I'm not sure, I haven't really been following their lineup.  I'm rooting for the Yankees!
How can you like the Yankees?  They are only good because they have so much money, they can buy a championship.
The Yankees are a historic institution.  They don't do anything that every other team would do if they had the money.
I agree that they have a very rich history, but they seem so snobby.  Like they feel they have earned the right to win, like it is expected.
Say what you will but have you ever been to Yankee Stadium?  It's like magic.
I've been a couple of times. Nothing like seeing the Yankees play the Red Sox!
The best games I've ever seen have been the Yankees versus the Sox.  The crowd is just electric!
Completely agreed.  That's when you can see the true spirit of the MLB, you can just feel the energy and passion.
I can't wait to bring my kids one day to see one of those games.  It's like a family tradition.
I love the traditionalism of Yankee Stadium.  It isn't one of the fancy stadiums catering to the wealthy.
Remember when the Arizona Diamondbacks stadium was opened?  They had a swimming pool!
I know, it was ridiculous!  We're here to watch baseball, not have a college party!
I do admit though that the Yankees have their faults though.  They have premium seating that is beyond expensive.
Is the premium seating just at a better section of the ballpark?  Or are there rules?
I believe it is the first four or five rows behind the Yankees dugout.
I can't even imagine being that close.  I always end up higher up, more often then not in the nosebleed.
It isn't a huge deal though.  Half of the fun is the spirit and the energy of the ballpark, not the seats.
I agree with you somewhat, but it would be exhilarating to sit that close, be able to hear conversations in the dugout.
One day maybe you'll sit there!  I bet the Yankees have contests for tickets, we should look that up!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how often do you play baseball here with your friends?
Whenever they can come out.
And how often is that?
Pretty often; only Josiah was out today, though.
What's your favorite baseball team?
The Boston Red Sox.
I thought so; I've seen you wearing a Red Sox shirt sometimes.
It's Josiah's; they're his favorite team, too.
Who's your favorite player on the Red Sox?
Heath Hembree.
Why Heath Hembree?
He's really fun to watch; he's a really good pitcher.
Do you want to play for the Red Sox when you grow up?
I'm not sure; I just like to do it for fun; I know they make a lot of money, though.
Did you watch the game last night?
Yeah, it was fun although they lost. Did you see the whole thing?
No, I saw it the next morning and people were talking about it at work.
I hope the Red Sox will win more games this year.
The season's still young, I think they have a good shot.
I hope so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Phillies ended their 4 game losing streak last night.
I saw that. It's about time, they needed that win in the worst way.
They got a good pitching performance from Hellickson last night.
Yeah he really got into a groove after that 1st inning.
He retired 16 out of 17 batters at one point. He was feeling good out there.
Yeah he had started the year out so strong. He had posted a 1.80 ERA in April
Yeah the Phillies need him to find that type of performance more consistently.
The guy is 5-1 this year, so they play pretty well when he is out there
There is a little concern over him though because his back tightened up in the 6th inning.
Well it wouldn't be a Phillies game if everything went right
The crazy thing is that it tightened up after he helped his own cause with an RBI double
Yeah, but they have already said that this will not cause him to miss his next start.
Yeah I know, but it is still something to monitor going forward
For sure. But this is the type of win that you need over another ballclub that's struggling.
Yeah the Pirates have their own slump going right now.
Well their ace Ivan Nova will be on the mound tomorrow.
Yeah he was the NL pitcher of the month in April
True, but he has not won a game in May
Baseball is a funny game that's how it works sometimes
I agree, but I think the Pirates win tomorrow.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see tonight's Met game?
I can't believe they almost blew it.
But they didn't. If they win tomorrow they'll be back in it.
They're still four games under 500.
Maybe, but the rest of the NL isn't doing much better.
It's only a matter of time before the Cubs start winning.
We're getting Lugo and Matz back soon.
But we don't have a bullpen.
If the starters pitch to expectations, we won't need one.
We still need a bullpen.
The offense has been good. If the starters can pitch seven innings and not give up five runs, we'll win games.
I still don't trust the offense.
Bruce is a good player, and they don't really need Granderson.
But why do they keep pretending Wright will contribute?
I don't think they do.
Then why is he still on the team.
I think he's earned the right to decide when he's done.
Not if it hurts the team?
It's not. They have Reyes.
Reyes isn't reliable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does baseball season typically start?
Usually around April 1st, give or take a few days.
How long does baseball season last?
Around 6 months or so, with a month of playoff afterward.
Do teams have a training camp like in other sports?
Yes. They call it "spring training", and it's about a month or so.
Between all those, it sounds like they're playing eight months out of the year.
Indeed. The regular season alone is 162 games.
That's a lot of games to not include the other parts of the season.
A team that makes the playoffs can play from 1 to 22 games.
What about in spring training?
Teams will play about 40-45 games each spring training.
Wow! That's almost 230 games a year, which is a ton of baseball!
Indeed, and I didn't even mention that some players will play elsewhere around the world in the winter also.
That's crazy! That probably almost 300 baseball games a year one player could play.
Thankfully, baseball is a non-contact sport that also isn't too physically demanding.
That's for sure. I've seen some players on defense not have to move an inch during an inning.
That's especially true if their pitcher strikes out a lot of batters.
Is that why you'll see baseball players play well into their 40s?
That is indeed true, and players can play 20-25 years as a pro.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would be the scariest bench clearing team that you could assemble?
Hmm. Let me think about that one.
Who would you pick to create an enforcer baseball team, a team of 9 players (pitcher included) that you would never want to bean with a pitch and have a bench clearing brawl against.
Stanton, machado with a bat.
I don't know.
How about Mo Vaughn?
He's like a teddy bear.
Tough crowd.
I agree about Stanton though. Just give him a bat and stay out of his way.
Exactly. How tall is he anyway?
He's 6'6".
I thought so. He just towers over everybody on the field.
Yeah but size doesn't always make someone a good fighter
True but it is great camouflage.
What do you mean?
I mean would you in your right mind pick a fight with someone who is that tall?
No way. I'd be doing my best to stay on his good side.
Exactly my point.  Not everyone will try a giant to see if he is tough or not.
You're right. Especially if that giant swings a baseball for a living.
Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the game against the Minnesota Twins and Colorado Rockies?
I did! How many strike outs did Berrios have again?
I think he had 11 strike outs.
That's incredible. He's been a real shining star for our team lately.
Sure has. Especially after that earlier afternoon games with the twins losing 5-1.
That game was brutal to watch.
Sure was. Thank goodness we pulled through with the night game. Snapped a losing streak for us.
Interleague has been a humiliating part of the season for us. No doubt!
Could you imagine, 3 losses in a row? That would put us in 2nd place. We need to stay strong this season.
Hey, at least we aren't as bad as the 3rd place New York Mets.
Haha! They've been true disasters this year with that pitching scandal and all.
We have great pitchers this year and Berrios has been a shining star for us.
Who do we play next?
The Twins are playing the Royals next...at home.
Oh no! Our home record has been awful this year. We need to just keep playing on the road.
Last I checked Paul Molitor was joking around they will just wear their gray uniforms at home to get in that mindset.
Ha! They should also display the Royals colors all over the stadium.
Ha! Good One. I'm looking forward to the game, it should be a good one.
Luckily it should be a blow out with Kansas losing all 5 games against us this year. We should go to the game.
Great idea. I'll look at tickets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think pete rose should be allowed in the hall of fame
thats a tough topic
yeah i know i think he should be in
he did bet on baseball
but is that a thing other people arent doing
i think it would be sniffed out right away
it could be but i dont see how it affected his games
he had a passion for the game
how is it any worse than taking steroids
those guys arent in the hall either
yeah but they can get jobs if a team hires them
thats true maybe he should be
i just dont see how you ignore what he did
he probably gets in after he dies
thats terrible let him see it
i think thats the worst kind of punishment
then they need a progressive thinker
As a comissioner?
I think that Manfred does an OK job
He hasnt had any controversies so far
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Yankees game last night?
Yes I did. What a tough way to end a game!
Yeah. I don't think they should have sent Ellsbury home.
I think you have to send him there. I think he has a better chance of scoring than Holliday getting another hit.
I guess so. The 7th inning was frustrating when the Yankees had first and third with no outs.
Agreed. I can't believe they struck out 3 times in a row.
RIght? Oh well, Yankees are still only a half game out.
That's true, but we need to at least come out of this series with two wins.
I think the Yankees will be fine. Hopefully the Orioles cool down.
Their offense isn't that explosive and I don't think their pitching is that great,
It's going to be a close race all season. Hopefully the Red Sox don't catch fire.
I know. They didn't start off as great as everyone was saying.
Anyways, how do you feel about Aaron Judge?
He's a solid player, but he started off so good that his expectations became unrealistic.
Last night his at-bats were pretty bad and he struck out in a key at-bat.
When he was hitting home runs every game, I made sure I never missed an at-bat.
Did you see the picture of him next to Torreyes and Betances?
Yes. Aaron Judge is huge. No wonder he hits so hard.
Are you watching the game tonight?
Of course. I'll be tuning in at 7:05. Go Yankees!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How can you watch this stuff? It's so boring.
What? Baseball? It's an exciting game
Excting? Right. Because watching dudes run in a circle after a ball. Real fun.
It is! You just have to understand the game.
I understand the game. I don't understand how you can like it.
Well, I use to play in high school so...
Did you? Did you wear the super tight pants too?
Of course. And my bum looked great.
Haha. So who is winning?
The Braves. The are up by 4 and it's the last inning.
Looks like they are going to win the whole thing,
Maybe. The guy up to bat now isn't very good. He could mess up the whole thing for everyone.
Why do they let him bat then?
They have to. Part of the rules.
Well, that's dumb.
Agreed. But it is what it is.
I guess. The only good thing about baseball is all the food.
You are ridiculous.
What? Hotdogs and beer.
I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Rockies are playing the Reds this evening
Yeah the Reds just got swept by the cubs.
The Reds are struggling a little bit they could use a win tonight.
Yeah but the Rockies are rolling and are looking really good right now.
Yeah they are 10 games over .500 right now.
And they are playing better on the road than they are at home. Which is impressive.
The reds are still only 4 games back after getting swept, so they are still engaged.
Yeah and it's still early, but I would like to see them take care of the Rockies this evening.
Matter of fact the Reds have lost 6 in a row, so they got to  stop the bleeding.
Baseball is such a long season, you just have to be able to hang in there.
Yeah, but you never want to fall too far behind. It's a marathon, but you don't want to be way in the back.
Yeah if they could just tread water and hover around 3 to 4 games out of first place they should be in good shape.
Yeah but that is easier said than done. They are in a tough division.
That division is tough. Especially with the World Series Champions Cubs and the Cardinals.
Yeah the Cardinals always seem to be hovering around the top.
The Reds are going to have to play awfully well to compete with this group.
But it can be done, they just got to get some timely hitting and good pitching.
Yeah but I think the Cubs exposed their pitching that last series.
True, but when the Cubs are hot, they will expose a lot of teams.
Good point. Hopefully, tonight starts a win streak for the Reds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
How are you?
Well, and you?
Doing good.  You a baseball fan?
Yeah I like baseball all right.
Do you have a team you like?
Yeah I like the Braves.
That's cool I like the Braves too.
Oh neat, who is your favorite player?
I like Freddie Freeman.
Oh nice, he's a good first baseman.
Yeah I really like him.
He is good.
Who do you like?
I liked a lot of players, but they all seem to get traded away.
Yeah I know, so sad.
I hope the new stadium will be worth it.
Me too.
bye.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will a Deion Sanders kind of player ever show up again?
What do you mean?
A guy who plays baseball and football
Oh, no not at all.
What makes you say that?
I think that there is too much money involved now.
So baseball pays more.
Right so they cant spend time on both sports
Or are the athletes just not as good?
No they are definitely good. Maybe even better
That runs counter to what you just said.
Yeah but think about how much training is needed nowadays.
I dont follow your logic nor do I agree with it right now.
Players have to focus on their main sport.
Do you think baseball has written it into their contracts?
Theres always that too.
So players are limited to what they can do?
I dont see how its bad to be honest it keeps them safe.
Thats true do you think a player would ever bargain it into their deal?
They could but I dont see it happening and time soon
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, can you believe the Rockies?
It's been crazy, the question is if they can keep it up
At some point the bullpen is going to cost them right?
Probably, I mean, the Dodgers are better on paper
At the very least CO will hit all year
It's hard for surprise teams to last, but maybe they can. They have youth
Yeah unlike the Twins they have a good mix of youth and vets
Anyway, do you think LA has the best shot in the NL?
They have the cash and assets to acquire more help, they have youth
But they can't hit lefties!
Yeah that is so funny and perhaps their downfall again. Though there's not a ton of lefties in the NL
But there are bullpen lefties and that matters in the playoffs
The key to beating LA is essentially keep it close for 5 innings and then turn over to your lefty bullpen
Okay, what is the saddest team in baseball?
Easy. San Francisco.
Yep. That is a team that has long needed to tear it down and rebuild
Does that mean trading Posey?
Well, that would truly be a tear down.
They have to do something, or pray they find some decent pieces in the offseason
I think their run is over and they need to start over
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about bench warnings?
I think it keeps baseball grounded.
But there are unwritten rules.
I understand those but some of them are antiquated.
If someone bunted to break up a no hitter you wouldnt have a problem?
No because the name of the game is to get on base.
Thats a progressive thought
I think you do what you need to in order to get on base.
What about throwing at a guy?
Bench warning should only be given if the ball goes near the head.
So if they throw at the ribs you are OK with that?
Yes its baseball thats how you keep players in line
It seems barbaric to me.
Other sports are way worse.
I just dont like the ejections automatically
Coaches should control themselves.
I think they do a good job of that.
Well not when their bench gets warned.
Thats true.
They have to keep the focus of the team on their minds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe the Marlins are still so bad this year.
I can.
Why's that?
The death of Fernandez really messed up that franchise. Their pitching is terrible.
Yeah, but the hitters aren't hitting either.
I guess. Stanton is batting what, .250?
I hate to say it, but he's extremely overrated. That contract...
Finally the Marlins spend monoey and the player doesn't live up to it.
He's making 1 million per strike out. Haha!
Ouch. And what happened to Yelich? He was so good in the World Baseball Classic.
I don't know. His batting average is just as low as Stanton's. It's a shame.
That team has been together for a while too. You would think it would click eventually.
The players aren't bad but the combination doesn't work. No one is hitting.
Who else is struggling?
Bour, Gordan, even Ichiro.
They may have to hire a new batting coach. What happened to Barry Bonds?
He's gone. The only one who learned anything from him was Ozuna.
He's doing real good, right? Probably the only all-star for them this year.
Yup. Oh well, hope they win tonight.
Game starts in 15 minutes. We'll find out soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know about America.
Is there any good American team.
Ugh.
Seattle?
Ugh, no.
The border states.
I heard good stuff about New York.
What's the place that plays New Brunswick teams a lot?
I think Vermont?
No, I'm not sure.
it's around there.
Maybe.
Washington?
Actually, huh.
Yeah, I'd think.
They must.
They're in the area, kinda.
They do good.
They do amazing.
Best team we have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you doing tonight?
I'm watching the Royals game on TV. Are you watching it?
No, I'm afraid to, I heard that Chris Young is pitching, he's been so horrible this year, we should have traded him last year.
No, he's not pitching, Danny Duffy is, but yes I agree about Chris Young. I can't believe the one game we saw in person this year he was pitching. What a waste of money.
My Mom was asking me why I thought hewas doing so poorly this year, I said I thought it was that he's lost about 3-5 mph off of all his pitches.
Well, that, plus, I think his arm slot is different, it seems like his pitches don't have much rotation.
What is the score in the game?
It's 3-3 in the 7th inning, they just put Al Albuquerque in. You should turn it on.
Albuquerque? When did we get him? How? I thought he was with the Tigers.
Yeah, he's pitched for everybody. Typical fill in journeyman. Like we don't have enough of those already.
I'm turning it on now, I have a feeling this will end badly.
Probably. At least some of our hitters are finally hot, Hosmer and Cain have scored the runs.
I don't know what we will do if they don't resign them. We will go back to being the worst team in baseball.
Well, they are going to be free agents soon, so it's better to get something for them than nothing.
I know, but it's like our entire World Series team has been totally dismantled. And not replaced with anyone good.
Oh, that's not true, we still have our 18 million dollar man who's hitting .150. He probably has some other injuy, again.
Gordon is such a waste of payroll.  I can't believe they signed him to that huge contract when he's always injured. We could have spent that money better elsewhere.
I know. oh, geez, Royals are now behind 4-3. Only 6 outs left to go ahead. Yeah, I feel real good about this- I knew I shouldn't have turned it on.
These last 2 seasons have just been soul crushing.  Guess we're back to the team we've had for the last 20 years- a losing one! Ugh!
I know. We may want to rethink going to see them play so many times when we go to California. It will probably be a real downer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Subway series is coming soon
Yeah, I'm not as excited this year as usual though.
I know what you mean, I don't know what's wrong with the Yankees.
And the Mets can't seem to keep it together to the end of the season
Both teams need stronger pitching
Well Tanaka is ok.
And the Yankees can't seem to get a good third base defense.
I don't think they're making the playoffs
Well the mets have Sindergaard
That's true but they have a lot of guys with injuries
Are the Yankees on the road now?
Yeah they're playing the Red Sox away
What time is the next game
Tonight at 8 pm. Channel 11
I think deGrom is pitching tonight
Mets vs Angels, right?
They're at Citifield
Oh no, traffic. Sometimes I hate when they're playing home.
Well they're back on the road a bit before the subway series
We;ll have to catch that on TV, ticket prices are way too high!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the game between the Astros and the Yankees?
Yea I can't believe Lance McCullers Jr. play!
He fired seven strikeouts in six shutout innings.
That was crazy! I can't believe that happened.
And at the plate, Brian McCann was great.
He unleashed a three-run bomb in the fourth inning!
Yea, this really secured the Astros' four-run lead.
I know. I'm look forward to 25 wins that they have on the season.
Me too, I can't believe it their fifth consecutive win of the week.
They're definitely on a roll.
What about the game between the Blue Jays and Mariners?
Joe Biagini did a great job that day as a starting pitcher.
I agree, a five spotless innings!
It really helped them secure their win 4-0 against the Mariners.
What about the game between the Braves and the Marlins?
I did see that game, the Marlins are off to a rocky start this year.
It's their fourth consecutive loss on Friday.
They came up empty-handed against Atlanta starter Mike Foltynewicz in the first three innings.
Yea but they had no match for Tyler Flowers.
Right, he had a second-inning blast and two RBI single in the seventh, taking home Braves' 12th win this year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
What's going on.
Not much.
You into baseball.
Yeah I like baseball.
What do you like most about baseball?
That's an interesting question.  Let me think.
Okay.
I guess it reminds me of my childhood.
Yeah that's a good point.
The nostalgia is pretty high with it.
Yeah I understand.
Did you ever play?
No never played. You?
Yeah I played some little league way back when.
Oh neat.
Yeah it was fun.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Boston Red Sox?
Absolutely not!  I'm a Yankees fan!
Hey, calm down there chief.
I can't help it.  I like my Yankees.
Were you sad when Jeter retired?
Of course.  He was the best
He was alright.  I was a Nomar fan myself.
Agree to disagree chief.
Come on!  You have to give Nomar his due.
You Red Sox fans are all the same.
What do you mean?
Everyone thinks Nomar is the best thing since sliced bread.
Hey sliced bread is good, and so is Nomar.
Haha.  Alright, he was decent.
Just decent?!
Yeah, don't push it buddy.  I'm trying here.
Ok.  Well, are you excited for the upcoming season.
Yeah.  We're going to win the series this year!
Not if the Sox can help it!
Oh, it's on!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the Phillies game yesterday?
Against the Rangers?
Yeah, man. Can't believe they blew it again.
Seriously. Their bullpen is terrible.
I really thought they would be better this year too.
Me too man, Joely gave up 6 runs in one inning!
It's crazy. They have nobody they can turn to in the pen right now.
I know, even Neris and Benoit are throwing awful. They have one of the worst pens in the league.
For sure, at least their hitters are turning it around though.
Yeah, that's true. I saw Franco hit another dinger.
Yeah, he's starting to hit a bit better. I think his batting average is up a bit...
Yeah, and Tommy Joseph too.
True. Although Odubel is really slumping.
Seriously, what's up with that? Of an all stay year too.
I don't know, I'm worried that extension is going to his head...
Man, I hope not. They really need a couple of these guys to stick.
Well, Altherr looks legit
Yeah, he might be the real deal. Luckily they have a good minors system
Yeah - if only the bullpen wasn't awful right?
True that! They need to make a trade, I think
XXXXXXXXXXX
I used to go to minor league ball games.  They were exciting and the players were all trying to make a name for themselves.
I went to mostly Yankees games.  Like I saw that one armed pitcher Jim Abbott pitch a no hitter for 8 innings until it was broken up by a hit by Bo Jackson of the White Sox.
Cool. It must have been nice to be in that park.  I liked the minor league games as they were much cheaper to attend and sometimes big stars would play in rehab games or appear.
It does cost to go to the show.  That game I saw a Yankee steal home successfully.  Almost couldn't believe what i was looking at.
Reggie Jackson came to the minor league park as an attraction after he retired and put on a home run show.  He must have hit the ball about 500 feet about 15 times in towering drives.  That was cool.
Neat.  A few weeks after the Abbott game they played the Indians and that time he made a no hitter.  That was awesome.  What a thrill to see such a special game.
I bet.  The minor league games I attended were very fast paced and the players seemed to go full tilt for the whole game.  What some of them lacked in talent they made up for wit hustle and guts.
I was lucky in that we scored tickets from a well connected friend.  It lasted for a few years and all I needed to do was pay for food and the seats were great.
The minor league games were fun.  I remember there were a group of people in the upper deck that always wore aviators goggles and hats.
Ha ha that must have looked funny. I remember some of the fans used to heckle the players.  Didn't like that too much as it seemed pretty rude.
They had a couple funny mascots that ran around for the entire game.  They pulled all kinds of pranks and entertained the crowd.
I just remember the music playing on the organ.  They did not have a mascot so in dead time you had to pretty much entertain yourself.
Well I just liked the minor league park as it was close to home and very entertaining.  Those hot dogs were really good too and the kids loved it.
We went to a Phillies game once at the old Veteran's Stadium. It was like going to a fight and a baseball game broke out.  They were pretty rowdy there.
I don't remember seeing many scraps at the minor league park.  It was close a couple times and both benches cleared but the umps got it under control in time.
I don't remember seeing any fights at the Yankee games.  Just in the parking lot when everyone tried to leave at the same time.
They had special days at the park too, they gave away things like small bats, team balls, caps and the like.  Every week there was something else to draw the fans to the park.
I did not go to that many Yankee games.  I think it was about ten over a few years.  I do not remember if they had gimmicks.  Maybe some little trinkets.
It was so fun to go to the games. There were sights, sounds and smells that were at no other place and i will always remember them.
For sure.  If you got there at the right time they would let you go to the monument park and look at the bronze plaques  That was pretty cool too.  Nothing like going to the old ball game!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best team in baseball right now?
Believe it or not, it's the Houston Astros.
Really? Weren't they the worst team just a few years ago?
Yeah. But that's when they were in the National League.
How long ago was that?
That was in 2012. They switched to the American League in 2013.
How are the world champion Chicago Cubs doing?
They're not doing quite as well as last year.
Do you think they will repeat as world champions this year?
I'm not sure. They need to improve some this year, but they have time. It's a long season.
So they aren't in first place in their division? If not, who is?
No, they're not. Actually, the Cardinals are right now.
Really? I heard they had a terrible start to the season.
They did, but they're doing much better now. That's my point. The Cubs can still do the same thing.
The Cubs winning the World Series last year was such a big deal.
Oh yes! That's because that's their first championship since 1908.
Wow! That's a very long time between champsionships!
No doubt. But they pitched, hit, and defended better than everyone else last year. They earned it.
I heard the Cubs let Dexter Fowler go the Cardinals.
Unfortunately, yes. I thought that was not a smart move, letting their guy go to a rival.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Red Sox off-season moves?
I thought they were okay, but not great.
I agree.  What moves did you like?
I liked how we got Chris Sale to help the rotation.
Me too.  He is a stud.
I also like how we got Thornburg for the bullpen.
Agree, good move.  Did we give up too much?
Not really.  Moncada is young and supposed to be great, but you never know.
I would have rather kept him and gotten rid of Castillo.
Totally.  He has proven to be a bust.
I wish we had gotten more power to replace Ortiz.
Me too.  Encarnacion would have been great.
I agree.  Moreland is okay, but nowhere near the power.
And we already had Hanley at first base.
I know.  I would have preferred getting a decent third baseman.
Tell me about it.  Sandoval is not the answer.
No, he was a bust.  And Holt is good, but not for everyday.
Right, he's a great utility man.  Maybe we can make a trade during the season.
Yeah, go back to the White Sox and get Frazier for third base and Quintana for the rotation.
I'd be happy to give them Sandoval, Allen Craig, a minor leaguer and some cash.  They can have Swihart too.  He's a bust.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Grant is making up a new baseball team called the Basemasters.
That's cool. Are there tryouts?
Tomorrow at one. Are you going?
I might watch. I was thinking of my brother actually.
He's a great pitcher. He'd do great.
He really is. I bet he'd make it on the team.
Does he still practice?
He does every few days with his friends.
We haven't had a team in a long time so I see why there's so much interest. Lots of people are going so your brother will have competition.
I'll tell him about it as soon as I get home.
We should tell Jenson too. He's a great batter.
Remember that home run he hit last summer?
That was crazy.
Did they ever find that ball?
No, never.
That's hilarious. He should try out.
We'd win a lot of games with Jenson and your brother on the team.
Absolutely.
I know Grant is just going to coach and stuff.
He likes to manage and organize.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So.....do you think that baseball players still retaliate against each other?
You mean like throwing balls and bats at players?
Yeah.  Like what happened between the Braves and Blue Jayes
Oh yeah.  What was the deal with that?  Bautista seemed like he was looking for something.
When he smashed that homer and ran the bases Jace Peterson and Kurt Suzuki both said something to him.
And then on Thursday Teheran was trying to nail Bautista on the plate.
What was that first pitch, 94 mph?
Yep, and it barely missed him.  Then his second throw, the one that hit Bautista, was recorded at 95 mph!
The blue Jays crushed the Braves Thursday night.
Sure did!  With 3 in the first and 6 more in the second two innings!
I wonder what Teheran was thinking about when he was pitching?
Seemed like he would have been better off keeping his mind on the game instead of getting back at Bautista.
Even after he got hit the first time, the second time at bat he killed it again with a double!
Yeah, he sure wasn't intimidated by Teheran!
These are grown men.  You'd think they would be over trying to get even with one another.
Right?  It's not like it's sand lot baseball!
What would have happened it one of his own players had gotten hurt?
The Braves would have really been sucking wind then!
All in all, let's just be grown ups and play ball here, okay?
Sounds good to me!  Steerike!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've never been that interested in baseball.
Really? But you do like some sports, right? I've seen you watching football.
Baseball is too slow for me.
Hmm... I guess there's not as much turnover as there is in basketball or football.
Exactly! And I prefer games that score more highly.
Ha, I have definitely seen low-scoring baseball games.
But you are a fan though, right? What teams do you support?
I support the Cubs primarily.
What city are there from?
Chicago. I also like the Mets.
Wait, aren't they supposed to much worse than the Yankees.
Yup.
So why do you support them?
I like rooting for an underdog. Besides, the Yankees have too many advantages.
What do you mean by that?
Do you know how huge their budget is compared to some of the other teams?
That bad, huh.
It's like they're playing with a loaded deck. And not even playing with it well!
Haha, I see your point.
Thank you! I'll show you a high-scoring baseball game sometime if you're interested; I have some taped.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Senators play again tonight.
Do you know when the Rangers play again?
I think they play on the road tomorrow.
I'm not getting a good feeling about their chances on the road.
Yeah, I think they weren't even that good before they made that trade.
Yeah, they didn't even get much in return that they could use right now.
I think they're preparing for next year, to be honest.
Yeah, I don't know why teams are willing to give up on a season like that.
It seems like they aren't concerned about the fans who invested this year.
Do you think they will even have the same coach next year?
I'm pretty sure they won't blame this year on Girardi.
Yeah, how can all those injuries be his fault?
Exactly, plus they're young.
True, they should be fine at most positions next year.
I think they could use a good closer though.
I think they have a really good one in triple-A right now.
Do you think he would be ready to come up for next year?
I think he could be ready now, honestly.
I think they could use him now.
I think he could be too young and could get hurt like the other players.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Could an MLB team go undefeated playing a college schedule?
All it takes is one hot pitcher
My brother said no. He also said LSU would beat the Astros one game out of 50. I think the gap is too large between college/professional baseball. Thoughts?
Your brother is correct. It would only be one game out of 50, but it would happen.
The talent gap is so large. Idk official statistics, but I'd be willing to bet 6 out of 9 starters on a college team won't make it to AA ball. Every starter on an MLB team is one of the best players in the world. I think they'd run through the schedule. Hitting/Pitching is so much more advanced.
The talent differential would be night and day. But even if you give the pros a 98% chance of winning each game, they only have a 36% of winning 50 straight. If you bump it to 99%, it is a 60% chance.
All things being equal, the worst MLB team wouldn't lose more than 2 games. Given that the NCAA team uses wooden bats or the MLB team uses aluminum bats.
If it's 100% on the same playing field there is no chance. Guys like Altuve, Trout or Harper would hit close to .550 with a metal bat against NCAA pitching.
Think a team like LSU, with really good fielding, would almost definitely win one in 50. All it takes is one game where the MLB team gee unlucky on balls in play and the MLB pitcher has control issues
I think college hitters could hit MLB pitchers, but college pitchers would get killed by MLB batters. That being said, I think the MLB team would have at least a couple of off nights. So no, I don't think they could win 50+ straight.
Talent gap isn't much different overall from each college to pro sport but baseball is certainly the easiest sport for a college team to beat a pro team.
College teams regularly compete well with pro teams in exhibition games, so while its possible for a pro team to go undefeated on a tough college schedule, its still more unlikely than likely.
College players play in off-season leagues with minor league teams all the time and they often beat them. And not just D1 college players... I'm talking D2 and D3 also.
College has a ton of players who are there to play College baseball. And their dream ends.
There are still examples of college teams winning exhibition games against pro teams. Granted those teams are frequently made up of minor league players.
The MLB team would be favored in each game, but the odds would probably be against them going 60-0 or whatever the total number of games would be for a season.
With all this talk aside, I would pay a lot of money to see a game like this played.
Likewise, but I still think your delusional if you think a NCAA college baseball team will have any chance at beating an MLB team on the field.
Ehhhh who really knows. We'll never get the chance to actually witness a game like that being played.
Indeed. Very true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Whats up?
Nothing you?
Same.
You a baseball fan?
I do like baseball.
Who do you like?
Like team or player?
Let's say player?
I really like Mike Trout.
Yeah he is great.
Anyone else?
Hmm let me think.
I am a fan of Matt Harvey.
Yeah he is good when he shows up.
Yeah that whole scandal thing.
Yeah pretty dumb.
Good chatting.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Red Sox/Yankees game last night?
No, I missed it!
Oh that's too bad! You missed a great game.
Yes, I'm sure. It's always interesting with that rivalry.
It definitely was last night. It went into extra innings.
Oh really? How many?
They played seventeen innings.
Wow, that's a long game. What was the score going into the seventeeth?
It was zero-zero.
Oh, well then maybe not such a good game. It sounds boring.
Not at all! There were several bases loaded, no out situations, but both teams managed to get out of them.
That's tough to do. Must have been good pitching!
It was for sure.
So who finally won the game?
The Red Sox ended up winning with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the 17th.
What a way to win the game.
It really was. The ball went over the Green Monster so it couldn't have been more perfect.
What a lucky fan who managed to grab that ball!
Definitely. I wish it was me.
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Yankees game?
Yes it was a good game.
Yankees are my favorite team.
Mine is the cubs.
Yankees beat the cubs the other day.
I know I saw that game, it was suspenseful
I wish I could have went professional.
Did you play in school?
Yea I played in high school, it was fun.
I played little league, that was the only time
My son is in little league right now. I love watching his games
That sounds awesome
Do you have a favorite player?
Not really, I just love the game and the team. You?
I've always liked Sabathia.
He's good. You going to watch the pirates/dodgers game tonight?
Yea I planned on it, the pirates are a good team.
I'm watching it too
The pirates are probably my second favorite team.
I like the Dodgers
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Texas Rangers have got to do better on the road.
How bad is their record?
They are 6-12 on the road right now. That's not going to get it done.
Yeah winning only 33 percent of your road games is receipe for disaster.
I mean think about it. They are awful on the road, but they are in 2nd place in the division.
So just imagine if they could at least play .500 ball on the road they could give themselves a real shot.
You would think so. You have to think that the Astros won't continue to play this well right?
Yeah they have to come back down to earth.
So if they could start picking up the pace on the road this could be an interesting divisional fight.
True, but something about the Rangers always worries me.
I know. They can never seem to get out of their own way.
I would probably give the Angels a better chance than the Rangers
I mean you could be right, but both teams have had their screw up moments
I can't disagree, but the Angels have Trout and the Rangers do not.
Point taken but the cupboard is not bare in Texas. They got some good hitters too.
No doubt. Both Joey Gallo and Nomar Mazara are having some good years
Yeah they just need more consistency away from their home confines.
Well the good thing is they have time.
Yeah but they are already 8 games back. You don't want to fall further behind.
True but they are in contention for one of the wild card spots if all else fails.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think AJ Cole can hold down the 5th rotation slot for the Nats?
He's pitching well, I don't see why not.
Ross is on his way back, that's why I'm asking.
Is he? Last I saw he was struggling in the minors. Hard to call that "on his way back."
You never know with Dusty Baker.
That's the truth. The way Dusty treats pitchers I wouldn't be surprised if the last healthy arm won.
Haha. Yeah. I like Cole though, I just hope he stays healthy.
Definitely a lot of promise for Cole and all things considered I don't see a reason why he can't take this opportunity and run with it.
Roark was in a similar position and it worked out.
Yep. And some think Cole is even more highly regarded than Roark was at that time.
Even if Ross does come back healthier that's not a bad problem to have though.
Got that right. Nats have a solid staff as is.
Yeah, bullpen is a little iffy but the starters are all pretty solid quality.
Scherzer is a monster. Strasburg when he's going strong is unhittable. Thats a 1-2 punch right there.
Gio Gonzalez is not bad either. At least right now he's looking like his old self.
Yeah I always forget Gio, was still thinking Zimmerman even though I know he's gone.
Gotta keep up with Mets pitching in our division.
Yeah they're another solid staff but there's some muck in the works with Harvey and still not sure about the back end.
Right but they have the depth that can figure it out over the course of the year, I see them as comparable with us maybe even a little better.
Right. When you guys play a series there's some good matchups on the hill.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about last night's game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs?
Crazy! I can't believe it went 18 innings.
Did you know the Yankees and Cubs set a record in that game?
Most strikeouts in an MLB game ever. Amazing.
The Cubs seem to be struggling a bit more than I had expected them to this year.
Haha, a new World Series losing streak has got to start somewhere, right?
I'm pleasantly surprised by how well the Arizona Diamondbacks are doing this year.
Yeah, they got Greinke last year. Looks like he's settled in nicely.
Too bad it took a whole season before this. Diamondbacks bullpen in general seems improved.
They're a nice young team. Could be very competitive if things continue to go their way.
The Diamondbacks have Goldschmidt at first base. He's a great guy.
Indeed! Gold Glover, All-Star... would love to see him get a World Series ring with that team.
How about those San Francisco Giants, eh?
Man, the Giants are terrible this year. I swear they should hire clowns off the street to pitch for them.
Speaking of pitching, did you see the Cubs' Miguel Montero pitch the other night?
Position players pitching is one of my favorite things in baseball.
Of all the Cubs pitchers who pitched that night, only Montero pitched a scoreless inning.
Ha! Cubs should pay him more money for playing as a catcher and a pitcher.
So, who do you think will win the World Series this year?
I'm going to go out on a limb and say the Mets. Just because they've been terrible so far and it would be an amazing turn around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thing about going to the baseball games with dad?
Probably how excited he gets.
I love watching Landon play too.
So do I. He's a great catcher.
Remember when he tried out and he caught that seemingly impossible ball?
I knew he'd make the team after that.
So did I. It was amazing.
He really is an excellent catcher.
He's not a bad pitcher either.
Yes, true, but Ron is incredible.
I think he'll get drafted in college.
Definitely.
Do you think Landon will?
I hope so. It's his dream.
I know that and it would be great if he and Ron could be together.
They'd be there to encourage each other. I can't wait to see if they both make it.
Landon has been talking about it for years.
I know and Ron has wanted it since kindergarten at least.
I remember him practicing at recess way back then.
So do I.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, have you gone to any baseball games lately?
I'm not a huge baseball fan, but yeah. I went to a couple of spring training games out in Arizona this year.
Oh, fun. Is that the Cactus League? I went there once.
Yep,it sure is. I think that is baseball at its best.
So who did you see play?
I saw the Chicago Cubs play the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals play the White Sox.
Great fun.So who won?
Uh, actually I don't remember. I follow the Detroit Tigers mostly,so I really wasn't rooting much for one over the other.
Ha ha. So what did you really do there?
Talked with my sister; ate hot dogs; played on my iphone; got some sun.
Well, speaking of the Tigers... you want to go to a game with me this fall?
Sure, that would be fun. Shall we get a group together, or just the two of us?
Oh, the more the better. But you will have to watch the game.
I can do that. Sometimes its kinda fun to watch.
Have you been to Tiger Stadium before?
Once. Well,once to the new stadium; and once years ago to the old stadium.
What do you think?
Well, I get the nostalgia for the Old stadium, but I have to say the new one is pretty spectacular.
Yeah, me too. Maybe we can go to dinner first.
Alrighty, sounds good. Looking forward to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about those Astros?
I know, first place! I can't believe it!
Those young guys finally playing well.
I agree, Correa, Springer, Altuve.
It's a really bright future.
The manager finally seems to have control of the team too.
I think the Veterans added to the team help a lot.
Certainly, you can't overlook the veteran players added to the team.
Do you think they will go all the way?
It's impossible to predict, I'd just enjoy it while it lasts.
Definitely, not every day you get to support a first place team.
Exactly, they certainly have the talent to continue winning games.
Did you see them play the Yankees?
Yeah, I was surprise with how much better they proved to be.
You know what could stop them? A trade.
They are not trading anyone I imagine, why fix what isn't broken?
I mean if another team gets better by trade, like the Yankees.
Ah yeah, that would suck. I still think though the Astros are very good.
Certainly, I hope we will see them in the World Series.
Yeah, that would be a dream come true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey. Do you know when baseball season starts?
Yeah! Its already started.
What? You mean to tell me I missed baseball's opening day?
Yep. Missed it by over a month.
Oh man. Thats horrible. Do you know when the baseball all star game is?
Yes. Its in July. Will you be attending the baseball all star game?
I wish. I can barely afford a ticked to a regular season baseball game.
Do you even like baseball? Ive never met a fan that didnt know when opening day was.
Of course i do. Im a big fan of baseball. My favorite team is the Yankees
Yankees?!? How is that possible? You live in Chicago
Ive always liked the yankess since Reggie Jackon played on the team
Ok. He was a good player. I cant argue with that
Whos your favorite baseball team?
The Cubs! Thats a given. I am a die hard cubs fan.
Must suck having to go 100 years without winning a championship.
Thats ok. We're champions now. Aren't we?  Hey... hey what do you say? The cubs are going to win today.
Ha Ha. You have one championship and we have tons of them.
Yeah but we appreciate it more. It might be another 100 years.
Now thats true. So true. The yankees are going to win this year.
You always did have a great imagination didnt you? I have to go. The cubs are about to play. Gotta love baseball!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like baseball?
It's okay.  I'd rather play than watch, it just seems like there's a lot time with not much going on.
You think the games are boring?
Some parts.  If it could just be the highlights, that would be great, with ten minutes a game, all the best hits and catches and outs.
That's not the way it works.
No, but it should.  I mean, I've watched some of a no-hitter and sure, there's some tense moments, but mostly it's just a guy throwing to another guy.
Have you ever been to a game?  Not just watched one on TV?
Yeah, in Seattle.  The field was really green and I guess some of the stats were kind of interesting, but it got a little boring after a while.
I guess if there aren't many hits, it can be a little tedious.  So, do you have favorite position?
To watch or to play?
Either, both.
Well, I can't really pitch and my throw is little short for an outfielder, so maybe first base.  Watching, though, it changes a little depending on the caliber of the player.
So, you just like the really good players?
I like really good players, but what I mean is that some seem to have a little more flair a little more style when throwing or catching.
I guess I get that, some players seem to just have a little more presence.
Yeah, they seem to be the ones who make these amazing catches or throws.
How are you as a batter?
I'm okay. When I've played, I usually get a hit every other time at bat, though mostly singles.
I'm not really a great hitter, I can only ever get fast balls and the pitcher learns that pretty quick.  But I'm pretty damn good as a catcher.
I could see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you like the Detroit Tigers?
They are pretty good.  Did you catch their game yesterday against the Angels?
Oh yeah, brutal huh?
Yeah it was.  I can't believe they lost 0-7.
Yeah, but their game on May 11 they beat the Angels 7-1
Detroit's pitcher,  Fulmer is top notch!  He's partially why the Angels lost I think.
Detroit has a lot of good players, it just seems like sometimes they're hot and sometimes they're not.
Who is your favorite player?
I like Upton.  You?
I think Kinsler is pretty good.
How do you like Verlander?
He's awesome!  Tigers are lucky to have him.
Yeah, he's been with the Tigers for a long time now.  He's got to be one of their best players.
How do you like Wilson?  He's pretty decent.
He's okay.  I like Verlander better.
Wilson is still pretty new, but I think he shows promise.
Do you know who the Tigers are up against next?
Yeah, they play the Angels again tonight and then again tomorrow.
I wonder how that will play out.
I know.  Seems like they're really on top of it or they get beat pretty badly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the extra-inning game between the Cubs and Yankees last night?
I fell asleep in the 14th inning, what happened?
The Yankees ended up winning in the 18th, I think it was past 1 a.m. local time
Jeez, so the Cubs got swept at home?
Yeah, and they're not even in first place anymore...
Who is? The Cardinals?
I think the Reds actually. But everyone is jumbled up within a few games of the lead.
Cubs were about 10 games up at this point last year? They must have the World Series hangover.
Yeah, didn't they start like 25-10 or something? This year they're barely .500
They only went 1-5 against Red Sox and Yankees over the past week or so.
Yeah, doesn't look good if they end up meeting those teams in October
Yankees are playing really well though. I think they are something like 20-9, with one of the best records in baseball
How are your Diamondbacks doing?
They lost 2 of 3 to Colorado in Denver over the weekend, still in second place but now 2 and a half games back
That division is all upside down this year. The Giants are way under .500
They're in last place and look absolutely dreadful. They're the reason the Reds are in first.
Yeah, they got swept in Cincinnati. And the Dodgers have been so-so. Although we knew the Padres would stink.
If D-backs can find some pitching they can win the division. Not sold on Rockies yet
Yeah, they're bats go silent outside Denver usually
They host the Cubs tonight for a series
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude did you catch the game the other night?
You mean the Cubs?
Nah man, you know I'm a White Sox fan...
Oh...its easy to forget such a terrible team..
Anyways... so it was Sox vs Sox *laughs*
I dont know why you always laugh at that.
...and it was funny because that one pitcher from Japan who sometimes bats DH..
Ryuki...yeah?
Well he was pitching do the DH...
so?
So it was the Sox vs Sox, DH vs DH!
...you are so ridiculous.
But this is where it gets crazy...
...
Bannon hit a foul ball and it actually hit one of the other guys who plays DH...lol.
Truly one for the record books...
So it was a DH pitching do a DH who hit a DH while it was Sox vs.
....yeah yeah we get it
So as you can see, crazy things happen all the time...
Speaking of which how about them Cubs...!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Cubs!
They'll never win the World Series again.
Please, they are going to win it all again this year.
Never happen. Their pitching isn't good enough.
Yeah, but they have minor league guys they can trade for better pitchers.
Maybe, but they got lucky a lot last year.
I'd rather be lucky than good.
I'd rather be lucky and good. The Nationals are the best team this year.
The Nationals are all right. Bryce Harper is such a showboating player.
If you were as good as Harper you'd showboat too.
It's bad sportsmanship. If I hit a home run I would just run the bases like it was no big deal.
If you hit a home run you would cry with happiness.
Yeah, but I would do it while I was running. Besides the Nationals don't have good pitching either.
Good enough. Better than the Cubs.
But the Cubs have guys to trade. The Nationals don't have a good farm system.
I admit, the Cubs have a very good farm system, but the Nationals have a lot more money to spend on free agents.
The Cubs have a huge payroll!
But will they spend as much this year now that they have actually won the World Series?
Yes they will, because they want to win again.
The Cubs will win the World Series again in about a hundred years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you catch the game between the O's  and the blue jays
Yeah!
It was a great game.
Yeah the O's  had that walk off homer at the bottom of the 10th
Yeah I totally thought they'd give that game up.
Well, they have been on a bit of a losing streak lately.
Their pitching needs some improvemeny.
I agree. They either hit well or pitch well. They can't seem to get it all together
Well, it was awesome to see Castillo hit 2 homers throughout the game.
Yeah that walk off homer was his first career homer.
Really? I didn't know that.
I thought good for him.
He's not the best defensive catcher, but the guy can hit.
I thought the same thing.
They've played 500 baseball so far this season.
Yeah but it's still early. I wonder if they can really keep the pace for the season.
I know right? They made the playoffs last year but gave it up early on.
Yeah well the pitching decision was the worst.
They should have bright in Britton. He wouldn't have cost us the game like that.
He rd he best saver in baseball right now in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it true that Derek Jeter and Jeb Bush are buying the Miami Marlins?
I thought this was joke at first but wow haha.
Right? That seems like strange bedfellows, no?
Money brings people together I guess. It says their is other bidders too.
Yeah, I'm reading Tom Glavine is involved in one of the groups that are bidding.
They have that new ballpark already, you'd think that new ownership would have a clear path to make their investment back quickly.
It's Miami though...they have a hard time getting fans in the park on a regular basis for those Florida teams.
True, but it isn't as bad as Tampa. Winning helps a lot.
Agree, but it's hard not root against Jeb Bush.
LOL the Bushes already owned the Rangers, we saw how that worked out.
For 1.3 Billion they better win something.
Fun fact: the Marlins haven't lost a playoff series.
Gotta get them there again to put that to the test.
I like a lot of their players, still such a shame about Jose Fernandez.
Aw man, yeah, He was supposed to be their anchor for years.
Poor choice of words.
You know what I mean LOL
Gotcha. Still have Stanton though.
They win when he's on the field but he's a little injury prone.
The knee, the wrist, it's always something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the best pitcher in the league right now?
Kershaw. He's the greatest pitcher of our generation.
What about Scherzer?
He's in the top 5, but Kershaw is in a league of his own.
I agree. He's worth 10 wins per season by himself.
The only fault against him is injuries.
I know, but long term I think his arm and delivery are made to hold up late into his career.
Yeah, he's not really a power pitcher who relies on velocity.
Do you think he's more valuable than Trout?
A think a pitcher normally is, and I'd take Kershaw over any other hitter in the league, but not Trout.
Trout has to be the most valuable player in baseball
I agree. Mostly because of his age and the fact that he's not even peaked yet.
He could go on another 12 years doing what he's doing.
So you'd take Kershaw over Bryce Harper?
Definitely. Harper is inconsistent and susceptible to injuries.
After Harper's terrible season in 2016, I don't know if I could trust him on a 7-10 year contract.
Yeah, it's like he turns it on when he wants to.
With Trout, you know what production you're getting every year.
So the top two players in the game are Trout and Kershaw.
They're the most valuable right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The SEC baseball tournament is the weekend after next
Yeah, I think Florida will probably win it all
I know they're favored but they always seem to choke in these tournaments
What about Kentucky?
They're traditionally terrible but their hitting is amazing this season
I know, they're the only SEC team that has never been to Omaha
Wow, I didn't know that
After Vanderbilt's recent rise they've become the undisputed cellar-dweller of the SEC
I was listening to Head-to-head the other day and they predicted they would host a regional
I don't doubt that a bit. Their home stadium has those short alleys in right.
I know, they hit a lot of homeruns in that stadium
What about Ole Miss?
They have solid pitching but their bats sometimes don't show up.
True, but they've played better at the end of the season. Bortles is hitting well
I could see them making a run in the tournament
They did last year before their regional collapse
Yeah, that game against Texas A&M was exciting, very back and forth
I missed it but I was not surprised that Florida won the next day
What do you think of Auburn?
They seemed to be cruising to an easy conference title but have collapsed the last few weeks
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been to the Braves' new stadium at SunTrust Park?
No, but we have tickets for later in the season.
Which game are you going to?
We are going in August to see the Braves vs Reds.
Awesome! My favorite player is Nick Markakis, who is yours?
I really like Freddie Freeman. He's a great hitter!
Yes, and a great 1st baseman!
I really wish the Braves would make it to the World Series again.
Yes, we are overdue for a World Series win!
Those guys in the 90s were fantastic players!
I used to love watching Tom Glavin, John Smoltz, and David Justice play.
Me too, and I miss seeing Bobby Cox running out onto the field too.
We have some talented players, we just need to get it together.
We're still in the "rebuilding" phase.
I really think Freeman, Markakis, Kemp, and Swanson are going to the ones to lead the team.
It will be interesting to see how this year goes, especially with a new ball park and location.
I saw an article the other day in AJC that called the park a "Home Run Hitter's Paradise."
I'm sure Freddie Freeman is loving that!
I still miss Turner Field though.
Yes, lots of good memories there of many good ball players that came through.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the doping scandal in baseball recently?
No, I haven't. What doping scandal?
They're saying that some 20 baseball players may face suspension!
Twenty? That's just crazy! What players are involved?
The report didn't mention all the names but they said that Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun are involved in the scandal.
So, what are they doing about it?
Well, the players union said that players are being interviewed by baseball officials and are represented by attorneys.
This could become the worst drug-abuse scandal in the history of U.S. sports!
Tell me about it. The league declined to comment to CNN but confirmed that an investigation is in the works.
I heard that Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances when he played with the Texas Rangers in the early 2000s.
But he denied using performance-enhancing drugs this time.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
It's hard to say. Nowadays, many athletes turn to these kinds of drugs to improve their game.
For his sake, I hope he's telling the truth.
It would be a shame to lose a good player like him.
What do you think will happen if they are found guilty?
They mentioned that the league may ban the players for 100 games.
Seriously? That's a bit much. Don't you think?
Well, they're counting the doping as one fraction and lying about having taken the drugs as a second one.
Oh, I see. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you watch any baseball?
Yeah why?
Well did you see the Tigers crush the yankees last night?
Yeah I did see that! Verlander had like 15 strikeouts right?
He actually has 18 strikeouts.
Wow, he's so good.
Do you think they are gonna make the playoffs this year?
I hope, it just depends on if they play consistently.
Thats true, it would be great to see them make a run for American League title.
Or even the World Series!
That would be amazing. Tigers haven't been in a few years.
I remember that, I almost bought a ticket to one of the games.
That would have been amazing to see them win it.
It might happen we've got enough good players.
You're right. With cabrera at the plate anything is possible.
I have not seen a player like him before.
He's able to hit the ball so naturally.
I know, I can't even hit a baseball.
Haha. We should go to a game sometime.
Sounds good to me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Miami Marlins might as well stop playing baseball.
This team is putrid, horrible and awful combined into one.
First of all, no one goes to the games down there.
Yeah and on top of that, this team has lost 9 out of it's last 10
Talk about unwatchable. This team couldn't compete against some minor leaguers.
Yeah this is not how baseball was supposed to be played.
If any team needed a day off tonight it is them.
Yeah, they should give them the whole year off.
The only bright spot seems to be Marcell Ozuna.
Are you talking about their Left Fielder?
Yes. He is currently batting .302 with 11 homers and 29 RBI
With those numbers he should be playing for a contender.
You would think. Not many people know this guy because his team sucks.
Yeah hard to get notoriety when no one is watching.
Can't really blame the fans, this is a bad product.
It really is and those folks down there are not the greatest when it comes to supporting local teams.
Yeah that is very true. Combine that with an awful product. and you get tons of empty seats.
Yeah it's like a ghost town out there. I don't know how this team is making money
Me neither. I'm just glad this is not a team that I follow.
Yeah me too. If it was I'd be pretty ticked off right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see what the Phillies did yesterday?
What was it?
They extended their manager.
Oh wow thats a surprise.
Who does it on May 11th?
I guess a team who is struggling with their identity.
Yeah I presume he wants to show that the manager will be here for awhile.
Or wants to show stability in the franchise for upcoming free agents.
No one cares about that anymore.
It is all about the money but some guys want to win.
I dont think Philly is luring those free agents for awhile yet.
True, they look like they will be contenders soon.
I dont think so, but back to the extension.
You cant fire a guy who has been given nothing
I agree but they could have waited a few months.
No I think they want to establish trust.
Could be but this guy looks over his head.
He has been given no talent
Thats not true, they have Herrera.
I dont know about that he looks terrible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about MLB agreement with Facebook?
No, what is it?
The MLB agrees to let facebook a game every Friday with no blackouts.
Sweet, I'm looking forward to those knowledgeable intelligent Facebook team fans commenting on the game.
Yeah, this is pretty cool. I like the gradual movement to actually streaming games.
No blackouts is nice too.
I wonder what the first game on Facebook will be
Its like the free game of the day, but more people have facebook accounts then mlb.com ones
I think this could work, we'll have to see though.
Good on MLB for making steps to modernity.
Do you need an account for the MLB free game?
The free game of the day still has blackout restrictions. So, it's even more than that.
I don't have a Facebook account. I hope I don't need one.
You don't? Everyone is on Facebook.
I'm not. I don't trust them.
But if I have to make an account just to watch a game, it won't happen.
Are you serious?
I am dead serious. Facebook can't be trusted.
So how does this work? Is there a page I'm supposed to follow/like to see the games?
I'm sure if you follow the main MLB page they will provide a link to the game.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you see the baseball game last night?
What baseball game?
The home game between the Bears and the Wings!
No, I didn't even know they were playing.  When did the season start?
This was the opening game.
Oh wow, I hadn't even heard about it.
Yeah, the stands were packed.
Where was it?
It was at Armfield Park, the old ball field, remember?
Oh, I thought they were building a new stadium downtown.
They are but it's not ready yet.
Oh wow.  So who won the game?
The bears did.
Really?  I thought the Wings would win for sure.
Yeah so did I, they had a much better team last year.
Yeah that's what I thought
but that new coach they got apparently is no good.
really?  That Daniels guy?
Yes, the new one from Florida.
Oh, I had heard he was supposed to be great.  Hmm, that's really disappointing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That Bryce Harper extension was a shocker.
In what way?
The amount of money given to him.
Yeah but why not long term.
Makes you think they dont want him around?
Trout got a multiyear deal.
True, I guess they are treading water for now.
Yeah but its baseball without a cap, it makes no sense.
Well maybe they dont want to commit to him.
How many guys are like him?
He is a generational talent.
So why not make him your cornerstone.
This is true
I think thats going to hurt them in negotiations.
Yeah if I am Harper I might not sign back with the team.
Hes gotta be hurt in one respect
But on the other hand he just made some serious bank.
And if he has a bad year?
I think they look at it as an abberation
You could be right with that one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that 18 inning game last night?
Yeah, 48 Strikeouts. That was nuts.
Looks like the Giants lost again.
Its been a rough start to the season.
Kershaw is definitely the best pitcher in the game.
No doubt about it, he just needs to perform in the postseason.
That Stanton is a beast. Two HR's the other day?
He sure is. He hits the ball harder than anyone in the league.
I Can't believe the Mets let Thor get hurt. What were they thinking?!
Their management is terrible and has a history of this sort of thing.
You think the Rockies can keep it up all year?
They are off to a hot start, that's for sure, but i think they will come back to earth soon enough.
Who do you like this year to go to the World series?
Tough call. The Cubs still have a heck of a team.
You think the Yankees will stay hot all year and recapture some of that magic?
They just might. They have some good new talent.
Did you see the Red Sox throw at Machados head the other day?
Yeah, that was bush league. You don't ever throw at a players head.
Sale struck out another 10 hitters last night.
He sure is something. Leads the league in strikeouts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever been to a baseball game?
Yeah, I watched the Cubs a lot when I was a kid.
Were you excited that they won the World Series?
I was so happy!
Me too. It was about time they won.
After being cursed for so many years, it was really nice to see them win that Series.
Do you think they'll ever do it again?
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
They really did impress me.
Me too. I was proud to be a fan of them.
How long have you been going to baseball games?
Since I was about ten. What about you?
I went to my first Marlin's game when I was six.
That must've been fun.
Yeah, I went with my dad. He loves baseball.
Mine too. He's the one that got me into the Cubs.
Do you like any other teams?
No, but I really hate the Yankees.
I hate them too. I always root against them.
You have to root against the Yankees.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Cubs can repeat this year?
I doubt it. It's hard to repeat.
Yeah, I don't think so either. They lost Chapman and some of their starting pitching isn't as good.
And baseball teams don't really repeat championships very often.
I think the Nationals might make it to the World Series, but I don't know that they win it.
It's so early in the season that it doesn't matter what the Nationals are doing right now. They always fall short.
It could be the Dodgers, but it's kind of the same thing with them too.
Yeah, but someone new has to break through.
I just hope it isn't the Cardinals again.
Or the Giants, but I don't think we'll have to worry about them.
What about the American League?
I don't know. I don't follow the AL as much as the NL.
The Yankees are surprisingly good so far.
I know. They finally have some young talent.
And they have Chapman back to save games like he did for the Cubs.
There's a lot of good teams in the American League right now.
You're right. The Orioles and Astros should be right there.
And don't forget the Indians.
Yeah, they came so close last year.
It's going to be a good season in both leagues.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe how many injuries the Mets have had this year.
Yeah, they've really had terrible luck
I don't think it's luck, I think there's something wrong with their medical staff.
Flores had a leg infection and Duda hurt his elbow. How can you blame that on the trainers?
Well, I still remember Ryan Church flying back to New York with a concussion
That was fifteen years ago.
You have to admit there's something wrong there.
I don't think so. Every team has injuries.
I guess, but it seems like their window is closing.
They've still got Syndergaard and deGrom under control for a few more years.
Ok, but they need to be thinking about how to win now, especially with their injuries.
Who is out there that they can get?
I don't know. I really think they should get a catcher.
Yeah, d'Arnaud is awful and he can't stay on the field.
Maybe Lucroy will get traded again.
I doubt it. I think Texas will be good this year.
Also I'm worried about their bullpen without Famllia.
I think Reed is a good enough closer.
But other than him, they're all terrible
Blevins is pretty good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey.
Whats up?
Not much, you?
Same.  You like baseball.
Yeah I do.
Who do you like?
Like team-wise?
Yeah.
Hmm let me think.
Okay.
I like the Braves.
Really?  That's my team too.
Cool.
You from Atlanta?
I grew up there but moved away.
Oh I see.
You live there?
Yeah in Atlanta.
nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been watching Baseball this year
Yeah a few games, Yankees are looking good.
Im an Orioles fan myself, they have been playing well
I saw that they lost yesterday though.
Yeah, but as of now they are still in first by half a game.
Yeah, I have a feeling that the wildcard team will be the team that takes second in the AL east.
Judge is looking good for you guys.
Yeah he is batting .315 after yesterdays game
Yankees have a lot of good young players.
Yeah. they were smart to trade their veterans when they did.
Yeah. this is a bonus for you, thye were supposed to be rebuilding.
Orioles look good too, looks like Dylan Bundy is coming around.
Yeah, 5-1 so far with around a 2.00 ERA
Machado looks like he is coming around.
Yeah, he was batting under .200 a couple weeks ago but is now at .227, he has been great defensively all year though.
I remember hi making plays, last time they played the Yankees
This should be a good season, as long as Boston is not in it.
Agreed they are public enemy number 1 to me.
Next time our teams play each other, we go catch a game.
That would be great, good to see you again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, the angles are I town.did you see the game last night?
Yes, I can't believe it went so late last night.
I know, 3 homers from the angles and 5 from the Mets.
I can't believe the Mets tied it up in the 9th.
The angles had it, but you know their pitching.
Yeah, they need to spend more money.
Did, you see how mad the coach got when they tied it.
How, knew the Mets would come back to win.
I didn't see the start, how much where the angles winning by.
They were winning by 7 in the 3rd.
Wow, they really inched back.
They sure did. I did see when the hit that grand slam.
I know, what a shot.
Those Mets got all the runners on base with walks.
I have never seen that before.
Plus 3 grand slams?
I think, this was the highest scoring game ever.
I can't wait to see what happens tonight
Who is playing 1st base?
Don't know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the score last night between the Diamondbacks and the Padres?
Yes!  The Padres were decimated.
10-1
I know it was insane.
It makes me wonder what the padres will do to the coaching staff?
Not just the coaching staff but the players.
Well the coaches are usually the first to go and then the players at the end of the season.
Very true, but I think both groups will have some heads will roll
Well we will have to see at the end of the season
Indeed we will
Getting off the depressing topic of Padres, did you see the tribute to Jeter?
Yes, they retired his number at Yankee Stadium
He very much deserves it
I agree he does
He has been such an influence on so many players coming up in the organization.
Not only in that specific organization but in the world of baseball
Very true
It is so important to remember the greats and make sure that they are honored correctly.  20 years in baseball is a long time.
Yes a very long time.
I hope I can get a job like that someday where I can be apart of a team for that long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What's up?
Not much, you?
Same.
You into baseball?
Yeah I like it okay.
Same here.
Who do you think is the best player in baseball now?
That is a good question.  Hmm.
Take your time.
I think maybe Mike Trout?
What about Bryce Harper?
Yeah he's okay, but I think Trout is better.
He was MVP last year.
Yeah exactly.
I think Harper has more power.
Yeah, but not as good defensively.
Good point.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Rockies are playing well this season.
I know. It's surprising how well they're playing.
It's like the Rockies are the team in the NL West that can hit left handers.
LOL. The Giants are awful against LHP.
Dodgers too. The Dodgers should be running away but they haven't been able to hit lefties.
Yeah, the Dodgers are under-performing for sure. Giants are always up and down.
Better than the Padres though.
Padres actually have some good young talent too. Myers is good when healthy.
Still well behind Dodgers with Seager, Urias, and Puig if he has his head on straight.
For sure. I think LA will get on a roll eventually. Too much talent to languish.
If the Rockies keep playing well they'll be right in the mix.
Arenado is a beast.
Agree. It's only a matter of time before he puts up some MVP caliber stats.
He's had some good seasons already to be in the conversation.
True, but he's still got growth to have a real year of mashing.
Especially in Colorado.
Do you think that helps or hurt his chances at getting MVP consideration?
Good question. I mean on one hand the park inflates his numbers but on the other hand his splits aren't that dramatic.
Plus there's the fact he has some other talented guys in that lineup.
Right, but lately they weigh your club's success with it too. All the more reason to keep the team rolling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats up with Kyle Schwarber?
Slow start after missing basically a full season and adjusting to a new position seems like a pretty reasonable explanation.
No doubting his long term potential but after 115 PA, he's only slugging .330 and he's striking out over 30% of the time.
That it is really really hard to hit in this league. I think he'll be fine and adjust. The league has learned some of his hot spots, and he'll adjust and be perfectly fine.
I'm not doubting that he'll rebound this season as well. My question is does anyone notice anything mechanically or perhaps were expectations too high coming into this season?
I mean, I think he's a .275/.360/.475 hitter this year, and more power in future years.
I don't question that he'll finish well and that its just a bad month but sometimes the struggles come from injury, a noticeable change in mechanics, etc.
Schwarber will get going. Although I personally don't know if he will ever be that superstar that his bat has the potential to be. I think he will be a solid 3 WAR guy. Just no superstar
Schwarber has time to become an elite player, and him playing left can be fine. But I'm not seeing passable defense yet, am I wrong?
No, probably not.
My concern with Schwarber is how is he fairing against RHP. Its totally common for even really good left handed hitters to struggle against LHP but he should be mashing right handers.
I mean, Schwarber comes with some higher expectations because he was an elite college bat.
But he was the 2nd best college hitter in that draft and he needed to be sent down after initial success when the league made adjustments to him.
Usually the top college bat in a draft ends up being a pretty solid hitter in the big leagues, and what minor league and MLB numbers have shown so far, he does appear to be legit.
I would certainly move him down in the order, maybe see if that can take that pressure off of him batting leadoff until he starts to find his groove.
I think Schwarber will be fine offensively
So its that its early and he will rebound?
I do think so. He's also been in the league exactly long enough, that the league knows his profile as a hitter now and are exploiting any weaknesses he may have.
He has to adjust back.
He will, don't throw him under the bus just yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess who I met?
Who?
I'll give you a clue.
What is that clue?
They just changed a street name to his name.
Vin scully!
How did you meet him?
I was shopping at a baseball card shop and he was there.
What was he doing there .
He was giving away baseballs.
Did you get one?
I got 2. Nobody was there.
I don't believe you.
It's true. It was not advertised.
How many people were there?
3 in total.
I was the only one really.
You said 3.
Yes, me and the people who work the baseball shop.
He was the best baseball announcer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How was the Phillies game last night?
It was pretty cool.
How so?
They won in the bottom of the 9th.
Really?
Yes, it was amazing.
I didn't see it.
Yeah, Joe hit a grand slam in the last inning.
Wow! That's cool.
Who was pitching?
Smith was pitching.
Is he undefeated?
No, but his ERA is 1.4.
Wow! That is super.
Will you be going to any games this year?
Yes, in June I'm going to see them play the Mets.
Oh, that should be a good game.
Yeah.  I don't like the Mets so I hope the Phillies win.
Me too.  I am not a Mets fan.
I can't wait to go and have fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the cubs game last night?
No.
Did you record it?
yes.
Do you want to know the outcome.
I would prefer not to.
i was hoping to talk about it today but okay.
Sorry man.
Were you busy or just didn't watch it.
I had work to do sadly.
Oh well that would explain it.
I'm sorry again.
I just enjoy our baseball talks.
I do too.
Well who do you think will win.
Obviously the Cubs.
Yeah I guess that was obvious.
They're my favorite team afterall.
WIll you watch it tonight?
Oh yes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Astros are great this year
Yeah, they have great pitching and hitting
D0 you think steroids have hurt bseball
Hard to say
Do you think the Cubs will win again
They do still have talent
Are you a Cubs fan
Not really
How many ball parks have you been to
3 or 4
Do you like domed parks
No, they don't seem authentic
Was honus Wagner better thsan Babe Ruth
In my opinion, yes
What is the length of the longest home run run ever hit
I'm not sure, but I would say it's around 600 feet
Who is you all time favorite player
I love Ty Cobb. The guy was a prick, but he was a thourouhgred.
You seem to have knowledge of baseball
Yeah, I love the sport.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The next match is next Tuesday
I might go if i have time then. Have you watched any good games lately.
Their is a really good baseball game that i watched that has my home team in it recently.
What is your hometown? because i seem to have forgot
My home town is Cleveland Ohio. not really that hard to remember.
So their is a game with the Cleveland Indians?
No i have not seen any of their recent games.
You should watch them they are mesmerizing.
I might if i got a chance but i am busy watching the other teams i really want to see that rangers match
That rangers match is gonna be good they will win like they did last time. By a landslide
They did?  That sounds impressive by how much?
over twenty points It was impressive i watched the game and i was just jaw dropped the whole time
I cannot recall the last time i saw a baseball game that was impressive.
I know right some teams are just awful.
I would not call them awful but they are far from interesting.
Yeah i watched the yankees game and it was just so Rote and almost put me to sleep.
I never watched a yankees game and i will never will.
Why will you not ever watch them i mean they are boring but not the worst thing out there.
They are the worst team in the league the best teams are the Indians and the rangers.
If you say so but i think you are making the right choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Morning.
Hello.
How are you?
Well, you?
Doing good.  What do you think about baseball?
Yeah I like it, you?
Love baseball.
Oh yeah?  Big fan?
Yeah.
That's cool, did you ever play?
Yeah I played for a bit, but wasn't that good.
I was also terrible.
That's why I watch now.
Yeah I get that.
Did you play in highschool?
No never did. you?
Yeah I played in high school.
What position?
I was pitching.
cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Red Sox game last night?
I watched it until the fifth inning then i fell asleep!
Wow, you missed an unbelievable ending!
Really?
Yeah, they came back from a huge deficit.
No kidding?
Yeah they were down by eight runs and came back to tie it in the ninth inning.
That's impressive.
Yeah, Sandy Leon hit a grand slam in the bottom of the ninth inning.
He is on hot streak lately.
Yeah, John Farrell has decided to go with the hot hand at catcher.
I like that strategy.
Yeah, he has been hitting for power lately.
They should start him as much as possible.
Agreed!  The bullpen played great as well.
Who pitched?
Embree came in for the seventh inning, Barnes for the eigth, and Kimbrel for the ninth to close the game.
That's a good combination.
Yeah, Kimbrel struck out the side to end the game.
Awesome, too bad i missed that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was looking forward to watching the Beltway series today but it got rained out.
Same. You a Nats fan?
Nah, O's all day.
Ah. I'm a Nats fan but I go to a lot of Orioles games too.
Good baseball is good baseball.
Especially during the playoffs. I went to an O's Tigers playoff a couple years ago. Place was on fire.
2014?
I think so.
We swept them right?
Yeah, then got the same treatment from the Royals.
Ugh. Don't remind me.
LOL not exactly rings over here in DC either.
You got Harper though. It's only a matter of time.
It takes more than one guy though. You got Machado.
Fair enough.
Did they reschedule the rainout?
I dunno, haven't checked.
The rain didn't even seem that bad in the first place.
My brother said the same thing. I guess the field was probably just beyond play.
Probably easier to beat up on the Phillies tomorrow for the Nats.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Nationals game?
No, I didn't.  What happened?
The bullpen blew another save.
Another one?  How many is that this year?
Too many.
That's for sure.
I think they have already blown four or five at least.
And have had several more that the offense bailed them out.
I wish they had made a better play for a closer this offseason.
Do they have any options now?
Internally, not really.  Everybody has been roughed up.
What about trades?
I think they would be very interested in that.
How much do you think they would have to give up?
I think it would depend upon who they are talking to.
Who is available?
I think the Royals closer, maybe the Rays or White Sox.
Didn't they try to go after the White Sox closer in the offseaon?
Supposedly, but nobody knows for sure.
Well hopefully they can find somebody good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's on 1st.
Ha ha, your funny.
Do you remember that baseball bit?
Kinda. Who started it.
I'll give you a clue. It was in the 50's
Abbott and Costello.
Yes. That was one of the best baseball bits ever.
I agree. Did you watch the game last night?
No who played?
Dodgers and Marlins.
Who won?
The Dodgers.
What was the score?
5 to 3.It was a good game.
I wanted to watch the game but I forgot.
I couldn't miss the that game.
Why else? The dodges seer back in town.
Do they play then tonight?
Yup, at 710 for the first pitch.
I'm so watching it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the progress of the Diamondbacks this season?
They are doing better that I expected.
What do you see that makes you think that?
First of all, their record.  They have been near the top of the division so far.
What parts of their game do you like?
You have to start with Paul Goldschmidt.  He is an all-star and if his performance continues he will be a Hall of Famer.
What other hitters impress you?
Pollack being back after a year off strengthens the line-up.
How about the pitching?
The starters have looked pretty strong.
Which ones have you liked?
Grienke, Ray and Corbin have been strong.
How about the bullpen?
Archie Bradley is vastly improved.
Who else?
Their closer is 40 years old and has had some pretty weak outings.
Do you have an opinion on the new manager?
So far I have liked his style.
What in particular?
I like it that he doesn't yank pitchers too quickly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Giants game yesterday?
Yeah.  Happy flight home after that one.
It's about time!  They've been terrible on the road this year.
Not much better at home.  What do you think of that kid, Arroyo?
Kid can hit!  He needs practice at third, though.
Yeah, Crawford will be back any day now.  He'll show him the ropes.
If he can learn 3rd as well as Duffy did, we'll have the best fielding infield in baseball.
Now if Belt will just start hitting . . .
Dude, if he can keep getting on base by taking walks, I don't care if he never gets another home run.
A walk's as good as a single.  I'll take it.
You hate to see all that power go to waste, though.
Yeah.  Maybe Bonds could work with him.  Give him some pointers.
Looks like Posey's all recovered from his concussion.
Yeah baby!  3 homers in 3 days!
Pence is even getting in on the action.  They won that game in the 9th, just like they used to.
Yeah looks like they're finally feeling like a team.  Working together.
Gotta do something about the bullpen, though. Keep Kontos and Law, put Melancon on notice, and ship the rest of them out.
With Samardjia right behind them.
Amen to that.
Hope Bumgarner heals up soon.  Really miss his pitching and his bat
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Dodgers beat the Marlins last night?
Yes! It had a little bit of everything going on.
Are you serious? You knnow i missed it, that's why I am asking.
Alex Wood extending his scoreless streak, balls leaving the yard and players clearing the benches.
That sounds exciting, give me more!
Dodgers reliever Ross Stripling and bench coach Bob Geren, along with Marlins manager Don Mattingly were all ejected after benches and bullpens emptied in the top of the ninth.
How was Cody Bellinger?
Cody Bellinger hit a two-run homer.
Talk about Wood!
Wood, who made his first three appearances of the season out of the bullpen, extended his scoreless innings streak to 20 1/3 innings - spanning three-plus starts.
Was strike out epic?
yeah, He has struck out 29, walked four and allowed 13 hits during that stretch.
Yes! continue.
The left-hander also lowered his ERA to 1.88, best in the National League.
Were the coaches upset?
Mattingly and Geren exchanged heated words during the benches-emptying ninth and had to be restrained from each other.
Anything else interesting happen?
Taylor, 26, finished a triple shy of the cycle. The home run gave him a career-high five.
I must say, that sounded like a fun game.
It was. It sure was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Werth from the Washington Nationals?
Which game?
Last night when he had four hits.
Yeah, but he strikes out a lot.
But he wins as many games as Babe Ruth.
What are you? His agent.
No, just a big fan.
I bet you have a Werth jersey.
Yeah, actually you're right but it's from Philly.
Big deal. Why don't you get one from Washington?
I can only afford one jersey at a time.
Then you're not that great of a fan.
My salary isn't anywhere near Werth's.
Whose is? He's not worth a fraction of his salary.
Maybe I should get an agent.
For what? You don't have any talent.
Let's get back to the game.
Okay, what was the score?
I forgot. I'll check my ESPN app right now.
Okay, please let me know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How about that Phillies bullpen?
It might be the worst baseball has ever seen!
They just dont have one guy that can get anyone out.
Feel for the manager, its like the wheel of death
They literally do not have one dependable arm.
Bullpens are hard to staff
Its a hit or miss part of the team
I mean who do you think could do that job?
Staff a pen?
No throw a seamless inning.
In their pen, Neshek?
Maybe but hes had issues
I dont think theyve thrown him into the fire.
They tried one time in the 8th and he didnt do bad.
Again, its tough to think what you could do with that kind of arm.
I think youll see the team not address the needs ever.
Vince Velasquez could be their new closer soon
I dont think so, dont take away from the rotation to supplement your pen.
Well bad teams dont need good arms back there.
Yeah thats why I think theyll do it piece meal for the rest of the year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is an appropriate salary for baseball players?
They are role models playing a childhood game, professionally. They should be thrilled to make more than $100,000.
I'm fine with them making a ton of money as long as they keep a small amount, like $500,000 a year, and give the rest to charity.
I'm the kind of person who would make that a law. You want a mansion on your $20 million/year salary, but won't give up a small amount of that to house the homeless?
Yeah, players who don't do that are selfish.
What do you think about pay-for-performance?
What's that?
Well, instead of giving a 30-yr-old a salary that INCREASES every year, they should be paid based on their performance.
I'm not sure...
So, someone who bats .225, hits 15 homeruns, and strikes out 200 times shouldn't make $10 million, right?
Right, that makes sense.
So why should that be the case, but then a new player gets paid the league minimum but wins the batting title?
Yeah, that's super unfair.
I love performance-based pay (even a game-by-game method).
But, that may have the manager NOT play certain people in order to make sure they don't get money. That's very unfair.
Right, so league minimums can remain. $250,000 to sit on your butt? Anyone will take that.
The other issue I see is attendance. How can they pay their players when they average 10,000 fans per game?
There needs to be more oversight so the Marlins owner doesn't keep pulling the same crap on taxpayers and fans.
Either way, everyone makes far too much money for what they're doing.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Afternoon.
Hello.
You a baseball fan?
I am.  You?
Yep, like baseball.
Nice.
What team?
I'm a Reds fan.
Oh okay.  I like the Mariners.
Seattle?
Yeah that's right.
Cool.
You from Ohio?
Grew up there when I was a kid and moved away.
Oh I see.
You in Seattle?
Yeah grew up here and stayed here.
I see.
Good talking to you.
You too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am not sure but have you seen the current trades going  on in the MLB they are insane.
Yeah i doubt some of those trades are good.
Why do you have doubts regarding those trades?
The trades just seem one way and they are getting some shitty pitchers.
I think i disagree the pitcher the braves got is going to be a legend one of these days?
Who is the pitcher you are talking about?
One of the pitchers is Jim Johnson.
I do not think i have heard of him might be why i view them all as bad.
He is really good he is like a flying bullet and he will help the Braves win.
I am not really a fan of the braves i have never really watched them.
You should give them a chance and watch them they are a good team.
I might if i get time but they probally play during a game i want to watch.
Well you can record games with your DVR and you can watch it later.
That sounds pretty easy do you know when their next game is?
Their next game is on Monday night not to far off.
That is a day i would be busy then  so i will have to record their game.
I promise you will not regret it the whole team is amazing. Their batters can hit anything.
We will see i am not so sure about that. But I want to look into the current trades though as i want to follow them you plan to follow?
Definitely i want to get all the info on the newcomers and who is going around.
Yeah that is true it is best to keep up to date with all that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best basketball player in the game
The best basketball player would be Michael jordan
How many points do you get for dunking
You get two points for dunking
What is a penalty in basketball
A type of penalty would be traveling
Who is your favorite basketball player
My favorite player is Lamar odom
Is dribbling a ball good or bad
Dribbling is good in the game of basketball
Do you like the concept of basketball
No because I see no point in it
Distance of a basketball court
I would say it would be 144 feet
Do you think the Dallas Mavericks are a good team
Yes because they won a championship
Do you approve or disaprove of LeBron james
I am neutral on the subject
Is there such thing as a two pointer
Yes there is such thing as a two pointer
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I've read about the Atlanta Braves, and they were actually good fairly recently.
Yes, and they have had several men become elected into the hall of fame recently.
That's incredible, considering the hall of fame is pretty exclusive.
I bet Braves fans miss those days when they all played.
I'm sure they do, but they certainly can rebound to that point.
I read about a guy named Chipper Jones, and he was really good, but why isn't he in the hall of fame?
Well, he isn't eligible yet, but next year he will be.
Do you think he will get elected to the hall of fame?
I'm sure he will because he played great defense at third base and hit very well.
Something interesting about him was that he could bat right- or left-handed.
Yes, and not many players can do that, much less as well as him.
I'll say. I think Mickey Mantle was the only other switch hitter as good as him.
Who were the other Braves players that you read about that were recently elected to the hall of fame?
They were John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux.
Didn't they all pitch for the Braves at the same time?
They sure did, and they even won a World Series championship.
Did Chipper play with them?
He did, and his rookie season, 1995, was the year they won the World Series.
Who was their manager that year?
Bobby Cox, who, by the way, is also in the hall of fame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the game last night?
No, did it play on TV?
Yeah, I thought you knew?
No, I hadn't realized.  Who won?
We did, of course.
Awesome.  What was the score?
7-5.
Really?  That's a lot of runs.
Yeah, pitching sucked on both sides.
It sounds like it.
Plus each side had two errors.
Wow.  Where there any actual good hits are was it just bad defense?
Well, we had a few doubles, but really nothing.
That's crazy.  They don't even have a good pitching staff.
I know.  We struck out seven times.
Really?  That's pretty embarrassing.
Yeah, I'm sure they'll be spending some time in the batting cages after last night.
Sounds like they need time practicing pitching too.
The whole team needs practice.
I can't believe we won.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rumors here in Chicago about the Cubs trading to get Quintana from the White Sox.
Who would the Cubs give up?
I dunno, Baez maybe?
That sounds light. It'd have to be more than Baez.
What about Baez plus Happ?
That's a start. Still seems like a silly rumor.
You don't think Quintana would be a fit for the Cubbies?
You can always use good starting pitching, it's rare. This just seems like a rumor for rumor's sake.
I've heard it from a couple different places though and it would make some kind of sense.
It seems more like local media trying to make a local rumor because it sells newspapers.
Maybe, but I'm just thinking about the possibilities.
Besides that, why would the Cubs trade Baez in the middle of the season?
I was just using Baez as an example because he seems to be one of the guys always being asked for by other teams.
I can't really think of a sensible match for the Cubs to trade away if this were true.
Maybe Happ, Eloy, and some others plus cash $.
That's more feasible I think, but if White Sox make Quintana available other teams could probably put together better offers.
If the Cubs want him, there's not too many other teams that have the prospect farm to match us.
Well then you're paying a premium if you really put the pedal down on a deal. Is Quintana really a guy worth draining the resources for?
You said yourself that the pitching market was thin. I think any capable arm is going to demand a nice ransom at this point.
True, but even in a thin market there's a limit that would produce negative returns if you give up too much for too little.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Orioles game yesterday?
Yeah, I thought my TV color was messed up because everything looked pink.
I know, It took me a minute to realize they were actually wearing pink for Mother's Day.
Kind of a disappointing loss.
Yeah, had them down 5-0 at one point.
Yup, All it takes is one big inning.
Still can't believe they got swept.
Right, especially after blowing the save vs the Nats right before this series
I think we've only lost like 2 series all year
Still feels like we are slumping big time
That could change when Britton gets back
I never thought having a shutdown closer was so important
Now you know what the Nationals feel like lol
Davis had a big shot yesterday
Hopefully he's getting his groove back
Yeah, I was starting to get worried about him.
He's not a liability defensively but he's not living up to his reputation right now
Eh, we've got enough people in the line-up who can put the ball in play that we can afford a HR lull from time to time.
Schoop is turning into one of the most reliable players we have.
Yup, that's why Buck has him batting 2nd.  I wouldn't be surprised if he or Manny take Hardy's spot as short next year.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best team in the early going?
Maybe the Astros, I love the way they play right now
Dallas Kuechel is really doing a good job.
What about in the NL?
I would say the Nationals
Whys that?
They just have a great record and have 3 weeks worth of games against really bad teams
Well they just got to feast on the Phillies.
I know but they play Mariners, Braves, and Giants.
I understand, how about the  Cardinals?
They are doing their usual surge which is impressive to be honest.
The Cubs and Red Sox have been slow to start.
Yeah and both will imrpove.
Chris Sale is killing it
Yeah and only getting hotter.
How about the Rockies?
The surprise team no doubt
I think they set a franchise record for wins so far
Yeah theyve never had a season start like this
Can they continue it for the season? I dont think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Look at him pitch. That's amazing.
I know. I can't believe how good he is.
Luke's not a terrible batter either.
Did you see that homer he hit last week?
Yeah. Did they evr find the ball?
No.
That's really funny.
Someone will find it some day and they won't know where it came from.
I can't believe how it just soared away.
I know. I was dumbstruck.
I think most of us were.
Did you hear that cheering?
It went on forever.
I bet they heard it in the next town.
Our town sure loves them some baseball.
True, especially when there's something like that to watch.
Did you just see that? Another homer!
Yeah!
This game is getting good.
I'm glad you invited me. Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner still on the DL?
Sure is.  They've been saying that he won't be back in the game until after the All-Star Game.  But I just read an article that says that he is rehabbing with them in St. Louis and might be back on the field as early as June 1.
How's Cueto doing?  Is he their number one now?
Pretty much.  Cueto is Cueto.  Did you read about the dustup on the field at the Giants-Dodgers game a few days ago?
The fight?
Yea, the fight.  Cueto thought Grandahl was stealing signs, and they started mouthing off to each other.  Finally, Cueto pitched at Grandahl and narrowly missed his chin.  That cleared the benches.
Did anyone get thrown out?
I don't think so.  But Grandahl told the press that they worked it out, apologized to each other, and it's over and done with.
How's the new kid, Christian Arroyo, doing?
He's doing great.  He looks like one of the Dead End Kids.  He's only 21 and can hit anything.  But that will all change as he gets older and the pitchers start to get him.
True.  What position does he play?
He plays third base.  He's from Tampa.
Is Jeremy Affeldt still in the pitching roster?
No.  He's actually broadcasting the Giants games with Mike Krukow and Duane Kuiper.  He's pretty good.  It's nice to hear his little asides about the team.  He can read the signs the pitcher puts down and can explain Bochy's thinking from play - to - play.
Did the Giants beat Kershaw in the latest Giants-Dodgers series?  How did Kershaw do?
The game which Kershaw pitched was the only one in the series which the Dodgers won.  That was the same game in which Cueto and Grandahl went at it.
Who else is pitching for the Giants without Bumgarner there?
Matt Cain, Ty Blach, Hunter Strickland. I want to see Lincecum again.
Me, too.  I miss the guy.  I wonder if he'll ever be able to pitch in the major leagues again.
The Angels got rid of him.  I hope he returns to baseball before he gets too old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The San Francisco Giants have had key players out due to injuries.
Unfortunate, especially since their pitching is hurting.
They do need a better bull pen.
Pitcher Madison Bumgarner's injury was his own fault.
I heard the Owner was mad at him.  Who can blame the Owner when Bumgarner is paid so much!
Matt Cain is pitching well at home.  He is also hitting decently.
Finally.  Did you hear that Hunter Pence is now injured?
Yes.  He will be out with a hamstring injury for 4 weeks.
It is good to have short stop Brandon Crawford back.
Since he came back the Giants are winning again.
How about that kid, Arroyo?  Only 21 years old.
No kidding!  He has been a great addition.
Catcher Buster Posey has a good string of homers and is handling the bat well.
Yep, he is a good all around player.
You are right, he also fills in at first base.
Manager Bruce Botchey used to be a catcher.
Yes, you can tell by the way he walks.
His walk is very stiff looking.
They squat in that position for so long during a game.
I think it is the most difficult position in baseball.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a baseball fan?
Not at all.
How come?
I like sports with Asians and there aren't enough in baseball.
What about Ichiro?
Yeah he was pretty awesome.
Did you follow him?
Nah, I guess the problem is the sport itself is what I find boring.
Baseball is the most exciting sport on the planet.
How do you figure?
It's the only sport where nothing can happen for hours, and then in one instance you could change everything.
No it's not.
Name another then.
Soccer.
Not really. Soccer, they are always moving.
That is true.
Plus, I hate soccer.
Me too, but i hate baseball more. Just goes to show how truly awful baseball is.
You're the worst.
Hehe
XXXXXXXXXXX
Boy the Mets really needed that win last night.
Yes they did. They got a great performance from DeGrom
Yeah he turned in a quality start just when they needed it.
I mean to silence those Angels hitters is pretty impressive.
For sure. To shut them out is a great feat.
Now they just have to try and build from this victory
Yeah one win is not a turn around, so they still have a lot of work to do.
Definitely. But this could be a springboard for them. They still have plenty of time in this season.
True. Reyes helped him out of a jam in the 7th inning.
Yeah he kind of got lucky on that blooper, but the Mets needed some luck
Yeah they were definitely do for some
They did an okay job on Trout
Yeah I think he only had two singles, so he didn't do too much damage
Yeah, they might not be so lucky the rest of the series
It's definitely going to be interested that's for sure
Now the Mets turn to Zack Wheeler to see if they can keep this going
What type of year is he having?
He's doing okay he is 2-2 this year with a 3.76 ERA
Okay. Not bad.
Not bad at all. He has been pitching pretty well lately.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Pirates almost have a no hitter thrown against them the other night?
No I missed it, who were they playing?
The Diamond Backs, their pitch Greinke took a no hitter into the 8th.
No kidding, who finally got on?
Polanco finally hit a homerun in the 8th to end it.
Wow, they are doing horrible right now.
I know, they are having a severe batting slump.
McCutcheon has been struggling a lot.
I know, they all have.
They have some pretty young players right now, don't they.
Yeah, their pitching staff is very young right now but they have been doing okay.
Really?
Yeah, they are at least keeping them in close games.
Not getting blown out.
No, the games are close they just aren't hitting to score any runs.
I wonder if they will be able to turn it around.
I don't know, sometimes I can't bring myself to watch.
I know.
They have been making alot of defensive errors also.
I know, they suck right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite mlb team?
the st. louis cardinals
me too!
what do you think of them so far this year?
well they have a winning record, but it is still very early in the year
yes, they are 21-17
Hopefully they a good series coming up
Yes, I think they will.  They are playing the Giants
The Giants are only 17-25 this year
it would be nice if they could sweep
who is your favorite player
Yadi Molina is my favorite player for sure, he is the heart and sole of the team
Did you see him pick off that runner at third base the other night
Yes, indeed that was a great play
they have a lot of other talent as well
yes they sure do
I believe wacha is coming back to pitch in the next game
oh really, I have not heard that,  that is great news.
I sure hope he is well rested and ready to pitch
yes, they sure can use some good starting pitching
XXXXXXXXXXX
the Cleveland Indians are really spinning their wheels so far
yeah really, tell me about it
it's like, one day the pitching is good...
but not the hitting, and then the next day they give up a bunch of runs and can't hit!
exactly, it's frustrating!
the bullpen has been tough though
yeah, I think Tito will figure it out going into June
injuries are starting to pile up though
yes, but they're pretty deep still
especially the pitchers
yep. how do you think they'll finish up?
well, nobody in the central is really good either, so probably they'll win the division at least
then it'll all come down to winning playoff series
and now they're battle tested
do you think they can win the AL?
yes, but that's not the question...
yeah, I know, the question is 'can they beat the cubs'?
exactly
and?
they better. :-)
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Cubs-Cardinals series this weekend?
I caught two games.
What is up with the Cubs right now?
I know. They are really struggling.
First it was poor starting pitching this season.
Yeah, the first inning runs were a huge problem.
But now that pitching is getting better, the bats are cold.
It's really baffling. Almost every hitter is struggling.
You'd think a team that just won the World Series would still be performing well.
I wonder if that is part of it. Too much pressure on a very young team.
That is highly possible. But the veterans aren't doing so hot either.
I really hope it's a temporary slump.
Me too. What do you think of the bullpen so far?
The pen is the only reliable part right now.
I agree. The bullpen is the only reliable part.
Yeah, even when they have given up runs, it's not really they're fault that the offense isn't providing run support.
Hopefully the upcoming home games will help.
They are playing Cincinnati. The Reds are always good for the Cubs.
Yes, I think we'll see a few homeruns.
And that could be what they need to get out of the slump.

What inning is the current game in?
I think they are only in the second one
Whew i am glad then means i had not missed the game so far
Really because so far it is an amazing game
How amazing would you say it is
Gonzalez is breaking through every batter it is the game of the season.
Wow he sounds like he is on fire in the game.
he is on fire he is like a beast with that glove.
What channel can i watch the game on?
It is playing right now on Fox go to it quick.
Just turned to it the game looks like it is in full swing
it is for sure i am on the edge of my seat.
You think Johnson is gonna bat out of the park today or strike out?
He has to get out of the park he has it in him for sure.
I hope so he has skill but last season he messed up and i just kinda wonder how good he really is
Everyone messes up so i think the guy will do great when he is up to bat.
I guess your right but he cost them the playoffs you know
I would not blame just him i would say everyone on the team was at fault
Possibly but this game is fire and i think he is batting better at least so far.
That,s the spirit just believe in him.
