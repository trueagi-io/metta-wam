Do you like the pitch perfect movies?
Yes they are funny
I love anna kendrick and rebel wilson
Rebel wilson is hilarious
Thos movies wouldnt be the same without her
I dont think they would be as funny
Me either
It was a good casting call getting her
It was
Im glad she agreed
XXXXXXXXXXX
i wish they would remake blazing saddles.
That is sacrilegious.
Why? Just update it with more modern actors.
What does that even mean? It's set in the 1900s. We can't have a modern actors. It's a period spoof.
Anyway, it will be more fun if it was updated with new actors, then. y'know famous people.
Why did I even begin this conversation. That makes no sense.
well think of it. Chris Rock or Dave Chappelle playing the sheriff. it will be hilarious.
Whatever, One thing I don't get is why people like Tootsie so much.
That wasn't very good if you ask me. But because it was set in the 70s. I just hate movies from that era.
I haven't watched in a decade I think. I don't even remember the details of it. But remember it being boring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite comedy about school?
Probably the movie called Accepted.
Oh, that's a great one. Isn't that one of Jonah Hills earliest movies?
Yeah, it is. He was really fat back then.
Haha, but still funny though. My favorite school movie is School of Rock.
That's the one with Jack Black right?
Yeah where he pretends to be a substitute teacher and makes a rock band out of his class.
That movie is great, I haven't seen it in a while though.
That's a shame you should watch it again sometime.
I probably will, now that you mentioned it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Will Ferrell movie?
Hmm, thats a tough one.
I would stay StepBrothers.
I could say that but I also think Talladega Nights was awesome.
The acting was so funny.
John C Reilly was awesome
He was a great secondary character.
So maybe that is the best
I just love Step Brothers
Its hard to change.
XXXXXXXXXXX
White Chicks is one my all time favorite comedies.
Me too. Every time I watch that movie I laugh non-stop.
The absurdity of it is what cracks me up.
I know. It's so unbelievable that anyone would mistake the Wayans for two spoiled white girls, but that's what makes it so funny.
I definitely enjoy the Wayans more in this movie than in the Scary Movies.
I agree. I think they are able to showcase their talents more in White Chicks, although I find both movies to be funny.
Really? I can't stand the Scary Movie franchise.
Wow, why?
I just think parody movies are so overrated, and they don't require much talent.
I guess you could say that, but they still manage to make me laugh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like movies that make me laugh.
Me too, if I'm in a bad mood I like to watch a funny movie.
What is your favorite movie to watch to get you out of a bad mood?
I think Superbad is one of my favorites.
Yes, that is a hilarious movie.
Jonah Hill and Michael Cera are both really funny in it.
I like the third guy, I can't remember his name.
McDreamy?
Yes, that's the one. His hijinks with the police are so funny.
I could watch that movie over and over again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Ferris Bueller's Day off?
I'd seen it a lot growing up.
I always wanted to skip school like that when I was young.
Yeah, Ferris Bueller seemed so cool.
He seemed like the nice type of cool guy though.
Yeah, the one that could always get out of trouble.
I loved when he was racing home.
Yeah, that was great.
Who was it that played his sister?
Wasn't it Jennifer Grey?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey broseph
Hello man
Want to come by
Sure what for
I want to have a comedy movie discussion
Why though
Because i want to figure out who the best comedy actor is
Well i guess that could be fun
Sure lets do it
Fine i am on my way
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Dodgeball?
Yes, Ben Stiller is hilarious in that movie!
Agreed! He is one of my favorite actors, I also loved him in Zoolander.
That movie was hilarious too! That's the one where he costars with Owen Wilson right?
Yes it is, I also love Ben Stiller in Meet the Parents.
That movie was hilarious. Meet the Fockers was great too!
It was! One of my favorite Ben Stiller movies is Along Came Polly.
That's a really good one, I love Jennifer Aniston in it!
Agreed, she plays a pretty different character than usual in that movie.
She does! It's the same in We're the Millers, where she plays a stripper.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Bridesmaids?
Oh, I watch it everytime it plays!
What's your favorite part?
Honestly, I think my favorite parts are anything with Melissa McCarthy.
She's really hilarious.
I think so too.  I think she made the movie.
I don't know if I would like it as much if she weren't in it.
The scene where she's driving away with the dogs is epic.
The part where they are trying on the dresses is good too.
Melissa was in both of those though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch 'Daddy's Home'
Yes, have you?
It was great how did you like it?
I really liked it.
Why did you like it?
I liked how Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg worked together.
I agree, they should have another movie together.
What type of movie will they make next?
I think a comedy/action will be great for them.
I agree, comedy for Will Ferrel and action for Mark Wahlberg.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite comedy actor or actress?
I really love any move with Will Ferrell.
Me too! He's hilarious! Have you seen Stranger Than Fiction?
I have seen that. I was surprised at how well he did with a drama comedy!
I know what you mean. It wasn't as "goody funny" as a lot of the other movies he's been in.
I agree. But this was actually my favorite movie he's been in.
Mine too! I think it was because he is still so funny even when he's being partially serious.
He cracks me up no matter what move it is that he's starring in.
I know, if I hear that something has Will Ferrell in it, I'll watch it just for that reason.
I feel the same way. I wouldn't have watched Anchorman, for example, if it didn't have him in it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
Grandma's Boy, definitely. Have you seen it?
Yes, I have. I love it! I love the old people.
Yea, the old people getting stoned are hilarious. I really like the part where the Monkey drives.
Oh yea, and the lion? That was great. Have you seen any other of their movies?
No, I haven't, but it does remind me of Super Troopers.
Oh yea, Super Troopers is awesome! Did you hear they're making another one?
Yea, I thought that was in the works for a while. I'm beginning to think that's not going to happen.
It's supposed to come out this next year.
Oh yea, I heard they had to do a Kickstarter for it. I guess we will find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a funny movie we can watch?
How about Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle?
I love that movie. Kal Penn is so funny.
Neil Patrick Harris really made it for me.
Oh I know. That was so unexpected.
Did you see the sequel to Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle?
Escape from Guantanamo Bay?
Yes. What did you think?
Not a fan. It felt forced.
I agree, definitely not as funny as the original.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick one, what is your favorite comedy movie?
I really don't know if I could pick one? If I had two I would pick either Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore
Really, you are an Adam Sandler fan?
I just remember when my roommates and I first saw those movies when we were in college?
What other comedies do you like?
Well, I am a big Will Ferrell fan as well, so I really liked Old School, Get Hard, etc.
Do you like Kevin Heart?
I like him but he is not my favorite.  I did like Central Intelligence with him
I also love old comedies like Coming to America, Trading Places, etc.
Now your talking, I love The Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to watch a comedy tonight?
Sure. I like the lightness of comedies.
Which ones are your favorite?
Adam Sandler movies are good. Not a fan of Jim Cary.
Nor am I. He's a bit obnoxious.
I thought only I thought that.
Liar, Liar isn't terrible but that's about it.
Yeah, that one is OK.
Have you seen many others?
A few but I don't like them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Karen do you like comedies. If so what kind?
I like RomComs mostly. Situational comedies are a close second.
Same here! My favorite comedy is You've Got Mail.
Tom Hanks is great in that one. What other comedies you like?
My other all time favorite is My Sassy Girl. What's your all time favorite comedy?
I love Vacation with Chevy Chase and  Beverly D'Angelo. My Sassy Girl...wasn't it a flop?
You're thinking of the 2008 American remake, it was a flop! Try the 2001 original it was a gigantic hit!
Sounds tempting, can I borrow your DVD? I'll swap you another comedy.
What comedy are you going to swap? I'm Mighty picky!
How about my Caddy Shack DVD and Vacation 30th Birthday on Blu-ray? You can keep them for a week too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best Adam Sandler movie?
I would say Billy Madison
That was great
What was your favorite scene?
When he talks about the puppy who lost his way
And the host berates the answer?
Yeah that part.
That was hilarious to be honest with you
How about yours?
From the time it started until it finished.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Will Ferrell?
I love Will Ferrell! What's your favorite of his movies?
It's so hard to pick. I love 'Step Brothers'.
Me too - 'Anchorman' is a classic, though.
It's crazy how long ago that movie came out and it's still so quoted.
Did you see 'Anchorman 2'?
I didn't, and I heard it wasn't that great.
Yeah, it wasn't that great. Nowhere near as good as the first one.
I watch 'Elf' every Christmas. One of the only funny Christmas movies I can remember from recently.
Yeah, it's definitely the funniest Christmas movie in many years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you seen that movie "Ted"?
Yes it was freaking hilarious
I know right, Mark Wahlber who knew he could be so funny.
And the bear cracks me up also
Did you know that they made a 2nd movie as well "Ted 2"?
No I didn't know I guess i'm going to be looking in my Netflix tonight
Yeah I would highly recommend that you look it up its almost as funny as the first movie
I will for sure
Well have a great night
You too see you tomorrow!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like Ghostbusters?
I used to like it growing up.
How did you like the remake?
I actually didn't see it.
Oh, did you plan on seeing it?
Well, I don't really like a lot of the remakes of classics.
I know what you mean.
I wish they had just done a sequel with the actors now.
Well, the guy that played Egon had died.
They could have worked on it earlier though.  He had died right around the time it was released.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to laugh, what's a good comedy movie?
Have you seen Superbad?
Is that the one with Jonah HIll and Micheal Cera?
That's the one. Its hilarious.
I really like Micheal Cera. He was awesome in Scott Pilgrim VS The World.
That was a good movie. It stuck really close with the comic books.
That's what I thought too. Did you see This Is The End?
I wasn't really a fan of that one. I thought it would be funnier than it was.
Really? I thought it was pretty good.
I think we'll have to agree to disagree here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good comedies recently?
I seen the new Kate Mchinon movie, Rough Night.
Was it funny?
It was very funny.
Is that like a romantic comedy?
Not really, it was more like a buddy comedy.
Did it have a lot of jokes?
Lots of slap stick and some nice and raunchy stuff.
It is about the guy getting killed right?
Yeah, but it is really funny. Situational humor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite comedy movie?
I loved Central Intelligence!
Oh yea, with the Rock and Kevin Hart, right?
Yea, you can't go wrong with those two!
That's for sure. I loved that scene when they meet up at that bar.
Yea, after all those years. He doesn't even recognize the Rock at first.
Oh yea because he was so fat and awkward as a teenager!
Yea, but then he got all buff and ripped.
The ending almost tricked me.
Not me, I knew he would never be the bad guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love movies about college.
Me too. Have you ever seen Old School?
Nope. What is that about?
It's about a bunch of old men who start a fraternity.
That is way out of line!
It is. Will Farrell is great in it. He plays a crazy drunk.
That has to be a wonderful combo. I loved him on Saturday Night Life.
That was some of his best work. You should check this out though.
I want to now. Is it just comedy or is there anything else?
There are some romantic stories too. I think it is a well balanced movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen Central Intelligence?
oh my goodness , that movie was hilarious
I really liked how the situations progressively escalated between kevin hart's and dwayne johnson's characters
totally. that initial scene after calvin wakes up after his first night reuniting with Bob really got the movie moving
I saw central intelligence for the first time while taking an airplane trip
how did you contain yourself
I couldn't, people all around me thought I was nuts because i kept bursting into laughter
it was very predictable though, but I still thought it was pretty funny too
bob jones (dwayne johnson) in the fat suit singing in the shower was ridiculous
yes! and Kevin Hart character being the cool kid in high school was a funny touch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big fan of comedy films?
Sometimes. It depends on what I'm in the mood for.
I heard you. I can only watch them on occasion.
Who is your favorite comedy actor?
Mine is probably Will Ferrell. You?
Kevin Hart for me.
I really like Kevin Hart but he is in too many films.
I know. He really sold out.
I can't blame him. He had a great reputation and received big offers.
I wish he stuck to his roots, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the neighbors
Yes, have you?
I have
Its so stuoid and funny
I love zac efron in it
Me too, hes hot
If i loved there i would move
Me too
Thats too much trouble for a house
Definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like 'The Big Lebowski'?
Who doesn't?! It's a classic comedy.
Agreed, but I guess it isn't some people's humor.
Yeah, the Coen brothers definitely do their own thing. Did you see 'Burn After Reading'?
Did that have Brad Pitt in?
Yeah, and it was by the Coen brothers. So funny.
I remember how utterly ridiculous some parts of that movie were, in the best way.
I know exactly what part you're talking about and it was so unexpected I bust out laughing.
John Malkovich is hilarious in 'Burn After Reading'.
I always knew him as a serious actor so it cracked me up to see him be so funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Happy Gilmore the best comedy of the 90s?
I think you might be right.
Wow thats great that we agree.
Yeah it had so much great dialogue.
What would you say was the best scene.
I loved when Chubbs fell out the window.
That was hilarious.
I also loved when Shooter got scared in the bar.
He acted pretty well in that movie.
And the script worked perfect for him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Risky Business?
Only the part when he's dancing in his underpants!
You missed a great show.
Yeah, Tom Cruise doesn't do many comedies.
Sad. He's pretty funny.
You think?
He was good in Risky Business....
Maybe I'll have to give that another shot.
Let me know what you think.
Will do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Knocked Up?
Is that the Seth Rogen movie?
Yes! The plot involves him getting a girl pregnant that he just met.
Oh wow, that sounds like quite a predicament.
It definitely is. He has to learn how to be a partner and a dad and an adult.
I love Seth Rogen. He does a great job of being funny but being approachable.
The movie is hilarious. It was directed by Judd Apatow.
Did he also direct the 40 Year Old Virgin?
He did! Judd Apatow has his hand in so many great comedies.
At this point, he must have made a lot of money from those movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You need to catch Office Christmas Party, it's hilarious.
Is that the one with Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston, TJ Miller, and Olivia Munn?
That's the movie. I watched it this past weekend with my girlfriend and we laughed so hard. It was really funny.
What did you really enjoy about it? From the trailers I saw it looked pretty dumb.
Well it is really silly, but if you're in that mood you'd enjoy it. It's basically about an Office Christmas Party being thrown one last time before the company supposedly goes under.
Is Jason Bateman the main star? He's usually really sarcastic and dry with his humor. I'm not really a huge fan of that.
Yes, he's the main star. He plays the company's CEO's best friend and long time associate. TJ Miller is the CEO, Jennifer Aniston plays TJ's mean spirited domineering sister and Olivia Munn is the company tech genius.
Was it just physical humor or were there a lot of actual crazy moments and funny lines?
It was a little to a lot of everything. You had some really funny moments in the action sequences, you had the recreational drug usage, and you also had funny physical humor moments with TJ. I really enjoyed the movie and think if you're in a mood to laugh it hits the spot.
I'll think about it, I'm not too sold on the cast, and the movie really does seem a bit too silly for me. I'm more into the Anna Kendrick type of comedies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Comedies are probably my favorite genre.
I get that. They're light and don't have too much violence or upsetting stuff.
I don't like to watch violence.
So which comedies do you like?
Adam Sandler ones, Jack Black ones, stuff like that.
Jim Cary?
No, he's obnoxious.
I actually think that too.
I thought it was just me.
Nope. He is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Big fan of Chevy Chase?
Yes, I really liked him in Vacation
Yes, and all of the other Vacation movies
Well, the original and Christmas were good, the other ones not so much
I also liked him in Funny Farm
I don't remember that one, I'll have to check it out
Yes, and Three Amigos was great
oh yeah, I haven't seen that one in a while.
It's great, aged well.
Ok, I'll check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like Mel Brooks movies?
Yes, I have seen all of his movies and think they are hilarious.  Blazing saddles has to be my all time favorite.
Yeah, that was a good one.  Really enjoyed their parody of the wild west.
Yeah, who was your favorite character in that movie?
Probably the waco kid.
Gene wilder did a really good job with that character.  the back story about him getting shot by a kid was funny.
It was.  Him and cleavon little had really good chemistry together.
Yeah, the whole cast seemed to work really well together.
Did you like the ending?
That was the only part that felt a little out of place.  i thought they could have done better on that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the funniest movie you ever saw?
"Blazing Saddles." I've never laughed so hard.
That movie gave a whole new meaning to sitting around the campfire!
I really liked Cleavon Little as the sheriff. The part where he rides into town and everyone is happy to see him, until they realize that he's not what they expected.
How about when his family had to create their own wagon train circle?
Great scene. Everybody in it was good. I liked Alex Karras, or should I say Mongo?
Even when he punched the horse?
Even then. What's the funniest movie you ever saw?
"Airplane."
Another gem. Why aren't there any funny movies like that anymore?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go see Dispicable Me 3 this weekend.
Yes, I loved the other two, I can't wait to see this one.
I know, I saw a movie review on the news a feew days ago.  He's got a new enemy named Balthazar Bratt.
Oh yeah, who's voicing him?
Trey Parker actually.
As in South Park creator Trey Parker?
Yup, It should be amazing to have him play a villain.
Yeah, rotten tomatoes gave it a pretty good review.
How could they not with such a good cast.
I don't know, but it doesn't matter, I'd still go and laugh my face off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see The House this month?
Is that the movie with Ferrell?
Yeah! It looks decent.
Yeah, it looks like it could be worth the price of admission.
There hasn't been many good comedies lately.
I agree. Can't even remember the last decent one I saw.
I saw that sisters one with Poehler and Fey.
That was alright. Kind of cheesy.
What movies aren't these days?
You got a point there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There is a funny movie I like
What is it about.
Well I have to prepare you.
Why is that.
It got really bad reviews
Oh that is funny.
Yes but it is so funny it is awesome.
Ok what is the name
It is called How High.
Ok I will look for it when I want to laugh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy romantic comedies?
Yes, I do, especially ones with Steve Carell.
I like him a lot, have you seen Dan in Real Life?  That's one of my favorites.
Yes, that's a good one.  I like The 40 Year Old Virgin.
That's a good one too.  What about Crazy Stupid Love?
I saw that one but it wasn't one of my favorites.
Yeah, I agree.  What other Steve Carell comedies do you like?
He was pretty good in Anchorman.
That's a classic, I love that one.
Yeah, me too.  He's such a funny guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the movie Bad Grandpa?
Yep, I actually just watched it yesterday.
Did you like it ?
Yeah, It was over the top hilarious just like the other movies with johnny noxville.
I thought it was even better than the jackass movies.
Yeah, they didn't really have to use nudity and disgusting things to make it funny.
Well, they did a little bit, but it was perfect.
Haha, like the scene with the fish.
Oh my god that scene was so funny I can't help but laugh every time I watch it.
Same, I really enjoyed that part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite movie?
I like Rush Hour alot.
That's a funny movie. Who was in it?
Jackie Chan and Chris Rock were there.
It's a pretty funny police movie.
Yeah, I like how laid back the movie was.
They played very well off of each other.
You could really tell by watching the movie.
Was it a laugh out loud movie?
Yeah, I laughed the whole time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite comedy movie out right now?
Yes, I really like Baywatch.
Oh yea, Baywatch was amazing when I watched it.
I really like how the Rock is branching into comedy movies.
Yes, I agree. His career is really taking off into the next level.
It is good to see him transition from one career to another so easily.
What comedy do you like?
I really like Fist Fight.
That one was great as well with Ice Cube.
Yes, Ice Cube was very funny in that film, just as he is in the others.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good comedies recently?
I just recently saw a movie called Shaun of the Dead, have you heard of it?
No, what's that?  It sounds scary.
It's a parody of the movie Dawn of the Dead, are you familiar with it?
Yes, I think I've seen that one.  Who's in Shaun of the Dead?
It stars Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.
Oh, I'm familiar with Simon Pegg.  He was in the Star Trek movies?
Yes he was, but he's much better in his comedic roles.  What about you?  Have you seen any comedies lately?
Yes, I just saw the new Lego Batman movie, it's hilarious for both adults and kids.
I saw that one too, they really pushed the boundraries with that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that movie with Emma Stone in it?
La La Land?
Oh no.  The one where she was a teenager in high school.
I think you mean Easy A.
Yes!  That's the one!
It was pretty darn underrated and funny.
It kind of put her on the map a bit as well.
She definitely elevated her status in that movie.  It was a cut above the other teen movies.
Too bad she's like 40 years old now.
Wow, you are way offbase.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a great comedy movie?
Young Frankenstein.
Who is in that movie?
Gene Wilder
He is amazing. I love his movies.
Ever seen Blazing Saddles?
No, I haven't
You have to see that one.
Where does it take place?
In the old west
XXXXXXXXXXX
Spaceballs was a good movie, wasn't it?
One of the better comedies to come out in the 80's in my opinion.
I don't think Rich Moranis did much after that.
Well, he did do the Honey I Shrunk the Kids movies.
Yeah, but not as good as Spaceballs.
Well sure, but just answering your question.
I really liked the reference at the end to Planet of the Apes.
You mean with them mistaking it for the Statue of Liberty.
Yep.
I agree, that was comedic gold.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like comedy movies?
Yes thats my favorite genre
Mine too
Do you have a favorite
Its hard theres so many
I agree
I guess big daddy
Oh that ones good
I love adam sandler
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the National Lampoon movies?
Yeah, Chevy Chase is a comedy icon!
Which one's your favorite?
Probably Christmas Vacation, just because it's a classic. You?
I always really loved National Lampoon's Vacation.
Is that the one with Wally World?
Yes! Where they take the road trip to California.
So funny. Have you seen Animal House?
With John Belushi? No I haven't, it's one of the only National Lampoon's I haven't seen.
Me neither, I've heard it's great though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
Ghostbusters for sure!
The one that just came out?!
Heavens, no!
Oh, good! I thought I was going to have to unfreind you!
Ha! No, the original.
That was a good flick.
Bill Murray's best!
They should have brought back the old cast.
For more than just cameos.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movies?
I like Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles a lot.
So you like old school.
No, I liked Haunted House too.
Malcolm and Kisha are great.
I loved how they ranked on Paranormal Activity.
Yeah, and Marlon Wayans is so cute
Haunted House 2 was just as funny
Remember the scene where Malcolm says "Tell him the dog is white"
Oh yes, poor Shiloh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new comedy that came out recently? It's called Chips.
No, I have not seen that one yet.
Me neither. i am hoping to watch it this weekend. I always been a fan of the show called Chips, when I was younger.
Me too! I watched the show everyday after I came home from school. Ponch and Jon always cracked me  up.
It will be nice to see a modern version of them. Do you know what actors will play Ponch and Jon?
I do. Ponch will be played by Micheal Pena and Jon by Dax shepard.
I have heard of Micheal as an actor but never heard of Dax. Is he a newcomer to the acting business?
I don't know. He might be. I can look him up on IMDB later and text you about it.
Okay. I don't think it matters though, he seems like he portrays a funny Jon character.
Yeah, I think we will get some good laughs from Chips regardless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like classic comedies?
What do you mean by classic?
Do you like movies like Airplane?
Yeah, I love that movie!
I do too! What's your favorite part?
I like the whole bit with the copilot.
That part is pretty great. It makes me laugh every time.
I also just like all the puns in that movie.
I feel like they just don't make movies like that any more.
I know! I really wish they would make more movies like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?
No, what's it about?
You have to see it! It's about a guy who tries to get home for Thanksgiving and he ends up traveling with this crazy guy.
Who's in it?
It stars Steve Martin and John Candy.
I love Steve Martin!
Yeah, me too! He hasn't been in too much lately though, has he?
Not that I can think of. I just remember him in Roxanne from years ago.
I'm not sure if I've seen that one.
You should see it! You'd love it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good comedies lately?
I did!  I just went with my friends to see Baywatch the other day.
That's the one with Zac Efron and The Rock right?
It is.  Those two are really great together on the screen.
I bet.  They're both very funny.
I also recently saw Sisters with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
I love those girls!  They were great in Mean Girls.
Tina Fey is so funny.  I love all of her movies.
I think Amy Poehler is even more funny.  Did you see her in House Bunny?
I did.  I thought she was even better in Sisters though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Hear No Evil, See No Evil?
No, but I think I've heard of it. What's it about.
It stars Gene WIlder and Richard Pyror, as a deaf man and a blind man respectiviely. They get involved in a murder case and are the prime suspects.
Okay, now I get the name, who else is in it?
Well, Kevin Spacey plays a porfessional killer and one of the real murderer's, along with actress Joan Severance.
This sounds interesting, could I get more detail on the plot?
Well, the murder is off Richard Pyror's character's bookie, who was smuggling a valuble rare gold coin for the killer's and tried to keep it for himself.
Okay, this makes a bit more sense to me as why the guys are accused of the murder.
Yeah, it was hilraious seeing them have to cooperate to escape custody and elude the killers, as RIchard can do things due to his hearing that Gene can't and vice versa.
This sounds like it could be a funny movie, I'll have to look for it.

What is your favorite comedy?
Baby Mama! I love Tina Fey and Amy Poehler especially together!
Yes! I love them. They made another movie Sisters.
Oh yeah! I am waiting for that to come out on DVD to watch it.
You should it's super good.
I also read Tina Fey's autobiography Bossypants. It was really good.
Have you seen Date Night? You would probaly like that too.
No I haven't I'll have to take a look.
You should! It's older but still really funny.
I love anything Tina Fey!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite comedic director is Mel Brooks.
I loved Young Frankenstein.
He was a brilliant director and he used the same actors in a lot of his movies.
Did you see Spaceballs?
Only like 1000 times!
It's a great spoof movie.
Yes there were so many great scenes in that movie.
I love that he would take classics and make fun of them.
But he didn't just remake classics either.  Remember History of the World?
Oh yes, one of my favorite dudley moore movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Groundhog Day?
With Bill Murray?
Is there another?
Just making sure. Why?
Probably one of the best comedies of all time.
I agree. Murray was great in that.
My favorite part is when he stole the groundhog.
Too funny.
Never let a groundhog drive.
Unless you have a death wish....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you enjoy comedies?
Sure.
Do you have a favorite one?
That's a tough question.  Let me think.
Sure think about it for a bit.
I really like Blues Brothers.
That's a classic.
Really love that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember seeing A League of Their Own?
I loved that movie!
It really was great, wasn't it?
It was based on a real league, too.
I liked Tom Hanks in that movie.
Yeah, it was funny to see him as such a jerk.
There were a lot of big names in that film.
Yeah, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell.  There were more too.
The red head that was in there.  What was her name?
Oh, that was Geena Davis.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your all time favorite comedy? Like the one you want to watch over and over?
Easy, The Princess Bride!
I love that movie! I laughed the whole way through it.
I know right?....My name is Inigo Montoya you killed my father. Prepare to die....
What about Wallace Shaun.....it's inconceivable!
It really is...You keep using that word but I do not think it means what you think it means. I laughed every time he says that.
Hard to believe Princess Buttercup is Claire Underwood.
What? Crazy. I did not put it together.
Talk about going to the darkside. Black.
Yeah, Darth Vader is like Mr. Rogers compared to her. I got to go watch that movie again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you ever see Mrs. Doubtfire?
Oh, God. Yes, I loved that movie when I was a kid!
Me too! What was your favorite part?
Ahhh, geeze. It would have to be when Robin Williams fills the house with all those animals for his kids birthday party.
His wife was so mad.
Yeah, she was. What's your favorite scene?
When they're at the pool and Mrs. Doubtfire grabs a lime out of a fruit tray and pitches it like a baseball at the back of the boyfriends head.
Yes! And she goes, "It was a run by fruiting!"
Absolutely classic.
No doubt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the Harold & Kumar movies?
Yes they are good movies.
What they go through for a hamburger.
I know it is really ridiculous.
They are funny.
I like when they are riding the cheetah.
When they finally get there how many of the burgers they order.
I know I couldn't eat that many.
They look really good though.
They sure do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen 'Shaun of the Dead'?
The English comedy horror movie? Yeah, that film is so great.
Such a weird genre but that movie really pulled it off.
So funny and the special effects on the zombies are actually really good!
Yeah. I love Edgar Wright's movies.
What else has he done?
'Hot Fuzz' which has the same actors and is possible even funnier than 'Shaun of the Dead'.
I've never heard of that one, sounds good though.
He directed 'Scott Pilgrim', too. That's a hilarious movie.
Oh, I love that movie. I watch it every couple of months.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watch Super Bad for the first time.
You hadn't seen it before?
No. Guess who recommeded it?
Who?
My wife!
No way! She's got good taste.
I thought so until I watched it!
That was a good flick.
It was, but I wouldn't have pegged my wife as a fan.
No doubt!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the 40 year old virgin?
Yes Steve carell is a riot.
My favorite is Evan almighty,  he's funny in that.
Yeah but I liked Bruce almighty better.
True,  the butt monkey scene was a classic.
I liked Jim Carrey better then,  than when he did ace ventura.
Hmm, I never saw those.
Don't waste your time,  they aren't great.
Good to know,  thanks.  What other Jim Carrey movies are funny?
Liar liar is pretty good. I'd check that out next.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Slapshot?
No.  What's that?
It was a movie from the 70's about hockey.
Is that the one with Paul Newman?
Yep, that's the one.
Okay, I remember it.  So it's good, eh?
It's hilarious.  You don't even have to be a sports fan to like it.
I should check it out I guess.
It's on Netflix.  Watch it and let's talk.
Sounds like a plan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like romantic comedies?
Yes, I love them?! What are your favorites?
I really like the ones from the 1990's and early 2000's. Like How to Lose a Guy in 10 days.
Oh yea, that one was great. I really love Matthew Mcconaughey.
Oh man, me too! He is so hot. Have you seen him in Failure to Launch?
Yes, I did. But I'm not a big fan of Sarah Jessica Parker.
Me neither, but I really liked that Bradley Cooper was in it.
Oh, I forgot he was! He is also a cutie.
Except I didn't like his character in the Hangover.
Yea, that one he was kind of annoying in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you recommend a good comedy movie?
What about Tommy Boy?
Oh, that's a good one. Chris Farley was a hilarious actor.
Totally. He was such a great actor.
He and David Spade make a fantastic comedy team.
I know, Chris was larger then life and David Spade is so dry. They really played off each other.
I thought that really showed in Black Sheep.
Black Sheep was okay, not one of my favorites though.
Really? I thought it was super funny.
Yeah, I don't know. Just not one of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What types of comedies do you like?
I like "smart" comedies, like Woody Allen movies.
I like Woody Allen movies, too, especially his earlier comedies, like Bananas.
His earlier comedies were sillier, but not my favorites.
His more recent comedies, like Magic in the Moonlight, are more mature.
Yes, I like those better.
Annie Hall is a classic. I like when Woody himself is in the movie.
It sure is, one of my favorites. I also like Manhattan and I like Woody's character in that.
I like that he plays neurotic characters. I like his choice of actresses, too, like Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow.
Yes, they're great performers. So real and genuine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie, Borat?
I love that movie! it is hilarious.
A lot of foreign people really hate it because they think it mocks their culture and is an improper representation of foreigners.
That's what makes it so funny though! I feel like if you cant enjoy it for its humor you are just stuck up.
Definitely, I feel the same way.
I mean, I could see how someone can be offended by it.
Me too, but if you are, its probably because you know some of that stuff actually is true.
Yeah, if it was a complete facade then people would know it doesn't represent them.
Agreed. The way they make it over the top clearly shows its just a goof.
If anything though, they could have had less male nudity. I wasn't a fan of that, haha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favirote funny movie?
You mean of all time?
Yes! I know it is tough to choose.
I would have to say Zoolander.
Is that the one with Ben stiller?
Yes it is. It is so funny!
I have wanted to see it forever.
You really should watch it. It will be worth your time!
Is Owen Wilson in the movie as well?
Him and Will Farrell both are!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Judd Apatow movies?
I do, actually, even though they're very silly and kind of crude, but also very much like real life.
I like Knocked Up. Even though it had some immature humor, it had some very sweet parts, too.
I agree. I think all of his movies are like that.
Yes, like Trainwreck, which I thought was really funny.
Amy Schumer was great in that. Apatow and Schumer make a great team.
And let's not forget 40-year-old Virgin!
Yes, that's a classic! I laughed so hard at that movie!
Steve Carell was perfect in that movie. He can make anything funny.
I also liked "This is 40." There must be something funny about being 40 years old to Judd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just showed my kids Back to the Future for the first time.
What did they think?
They loved it!
Man, that movie takes me back.
To the future...
No, dork! To the past.
Ha! You'll have to show them the rest.
I am this weekend.
I should bring my kids by.
Please do!
XXXXXXXXXXX

XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Home Alone the most overrated comedy ever?
It's got to be up there.
Macaulay Culkin never exactly went anywhere.
He was pretty much done after this movie.  Probably made a ton from it.
Makes you wonder if he got a cut of the gross profits.  If so, he has life made.
Yeah, that movie grossed about $20 billion take a billion or so.
You're funny.  It was all the rage back then.
It's the last movie Joe Pesci even did that I can remember.
And they made some sequels for no reason either.
Oh, there was a reason alright.  More money!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen fist fight?
The new version or the original?
Huh? There was an original? I didn't know that.
Yeah it's older,  but no... I haven't seen the remake.
It's pretty funny, it has ice cube and Charlie day.
Oh Charlie day is great,  I liked him in Pacific rim.
That's not a comedy is it?
No but he still does a good job,  and his character is pretty funny.
That's good.  I liked Charlie day in horrible bosses.
Oh yeah haha now THATS a comedy movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like Owen Wilson?
Yes he is cool.
Did you see Wedding Crashers?
Yes I liked that movie it was pretty cool.
Owen is one of my favorite he is so funny.
I like Luke Wilson too.
Did you see Hall Pass?
Yes that movie was something.
Yes it was nuts.
I liked it but I wouldn't watch with any little ones around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the comedy movie Mrs. Doubtfire?
That is with Robin Williams right?
Yeah, he is so funny.
I like comedy movies where a man pretends to be a woman.
Do you know any other ones?
Yeah, Tootsie and Some Like it Hot.
Cool, who is in Tootsie?
Dustin Hoffman
Oh, he is awesome.
Yeah and very funny. Bill Murray is in Tootsie too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good movies lately?
I saw Bad Moms not too long ago, that movie was hilarious.
Is that the one with Mila Kunis?
Yes, Kristen Bell was in it too.
Did you know Kristen Bell is married to Dax Shepard?
Is he the one who was in Baby Mama?
Yes, he played Amy Poehler's boyfriend.
That's right! What other movies has he been in?
He was in the movie Without a Paddle a long time ago.
The one with Seth Green?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Zoolander?
Yeah with Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller?
Yep, I love that movie.
It's been a long time since I have seen it.
Well you remember the ending right?
I think so, with the modeling competition right?
Yeah and Will Ferrel trying to mind control Ben Stiller with music.
Didn't he try to make him kill some Asian guy?
Haha, yeah that part is too funny.
I'll have to watch that movie again soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like comedy movies
Me too, i just watched central intelligence
Who is in it?
Kevin hart and the rock
It sounds like it was funny.
It was hilarious, i hope they come out with another one.
I might watch it.
You should you wouldnt regret it.
I really like kevin hart movies
They are always funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need a good movie to watch Saturday night. Any suggestions?
Well what genre are you looking for?
I would really enjoy a comedy, I think.
Well I have the perfect comedy for you. It's a little crude, but it is so funny!
Well, what is it?
The Heat. It has Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock in it.
I have never seen that. I have heard good things though.
I don't think it will let you down. But, if you want another suggestion I would look for the older movie Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.
Now I have seen that one. I love Steve Martin!
Me too, he is so great in any movie that he is in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Jim Carrey movie?
The Mask
Oh, I love that one.
Yeah, it is my favorite of all time.
Is Cameron Diaz in that?
Yeah, she plays the love interest.
Cool. I saw that movie when I was young.
Me too. I thought it was so funny.
Did you like that dance number they did?
Yes, that was very creative and entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Caddyshack?
Oh yeah, classic comedy movie.
Some great scenes in that movie
Yeah, Bill Murray and the gopher
And Rodney Dangerfield and the big boat
Oh and his outfits, what a trip
And don't forget about the pool scene
Yeah that was great, what was it a Snickers bar?
I think Baby Ruth
Yeah, Baby Ruth...classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Uncle Buck.
I never seen that one.
It is an old one it's pretty funny.
Ever see Home Alone?
Yes I like that one.
Did you ever see Superbad?
Yes I love Superbad.
I like the end where they are staring at each other. It's like they can't be away from each other.
Yes they are best buddies.
It is definitely one of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen 50 First Dates?
Was that with Adam Sandler?
Yeah and Drew Barrymore.
Yeah, that was a pretty sweet movie.
Yeah, pretty funny too, right.
I mean, it had funny moments, but I saw it more as romantic comedy.
I guess.  I wonder what that would be like in real life.
Well, it's based on a real life case.
Really, I didn't know that.
Yeah, I don't remember how the girl lost her memory, but there's enough to base it on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie pitch perfect ?
no but i hear its good
yes, you should watch pitch perfect and pitch perfect 2.
they made two of them?
yes, watch both of  them so we can go see the 3rd one
when does the 3rd movie come out?
dec 2017
awesome i will have to go buy them

ok, i will pick them up tomorrow
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Who is your favorite comedy star?
I like Adam Sandler a lot.
Oh okay.
Do you like him?
He's just okay for me.
I really like most of his movies.
That's my problem, so are good some are duds.
They are usually successful though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Ben Stiller movie?
Probably Something about Mary.
Mine too!
"How'd you get the beans above the frank?!"
"Frank and Beans!"
Stop it! You're killing me!
Too funny.
I'm gonna have to watch that again.
I have a copy.
You have to let me borrow it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, I was so tired this morning I almost lost my car!
That reminds me of the movie Dude Where's My Car.
That movie sounds so stupid. What is it about?
It's about what you just said. A guy wakes up delirious and loses his car.
Alright, I will admit that sounds kind of interesting.
It is. It's got everything. Time travel, kidnapping, and bullies.
Those are three of my favorite things in movies.
Me too. You have to have some conflict for a movie to be interesting.
It sounds wacky, but does that plot at least make sense?
It does. While it is childish, there are many life lessons to be learned in Dude Where's My Car
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know Key and Peele from Comedy Central?
Yeah, what about them?
Well they made this hilarious movie called Keanu.
Oh I really wana see that, is it good?
Yes, its one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
I'm really glad to see those guys careers taking off like that.
I know right, they did so great on their show on Comedy Central.
I used to watch that show every single chance I got.
Me too, It sucks that they aren't making new episodes anymore
Yep, but that's just how it is. They had to move on to bigger and better things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your all time favorite comedy?
Well, I really loved Wedding Singer because Adam Sandler is my favorite actor!
That's my favorite too! My favorite movie is 50 First Dates!
Oh, nice! I love any movie with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.
I totally agree!
They have great chemistry and would make the cutest couple!
Yep and I love all the music in Wedding Singer too!
Yeah, the song that he sings to her inside the plane was the sweetest ever!
I want someone to sing that to me!
It is cute when they sing in the restaurant scene too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie with zombies in it?
Definitely Zombieland.
Oh yeah, I haven't seen that movie in a long time.
No way? You should watch it again, its great.
Doesn't that have Woody Harrelson?
Yeah he played a really tough guy who lost his son.
Yeah that part was pretty sad.
I thought it was really sad how he pretended it was a dog at first.
Yeah it sucks the pain of losing someone is hard to own up to.
He really played that role well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is funny the hangover or bridesmaids?
Hangover is my favorite of all time.
I liked hangover and hangover part 2, but thought overall bridesmaids may have been better.
No way. I think bridesmaids was great don't get me wrong. But Hangover had so many great moments.
Zach Galifianakis does shine in hangover. I did like the plot of the first one. The sequel I did not enjoy as much.
I enjoyed them both. I think they did a great job a lot of sequels bomb badly or can't live up to the first. I think the second is just as good.
It is a matter of opinion I guess, I still says bridesmaid is funnier than both hangovers.
Melissa mccartney stood out to me in bridesmaids.
She is really funny in it, my favorite is when she is on the plane and lifts her leg.
That is a great moment. I was surprised she could get her leg up so high. She has lost a lot of weight since then, typical of hollywood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What sort of idea do you have
Well i have an idea for a comedy movie
Well is it a good idea
Yeah it is a pretty amazing idea
Well lay it on me
My idea is that we should mix stand up with a movie and make it intermix
So sorta like seinfeld
More than that
Like how
Like make it a regular thing between going back and forth not just at the start of the movie would be a brilliant comedy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Deadpool yet?
Not yet.  How was it?
Pretty darn funny.  A bit crude though.
Well, it's rated R I believe.
Oh yeah, a well-deserved R.  It's violent and full of strong language.
So you're saying I shouldn't take my daughter?
Of course not.  She's got another ten years before she should see it.
I don't think I can wait that long.
Want to borrow my copy?
Sure.  Something for family movie night, eh?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
You like comedy movies?
Yeah sure.
me too.
Do you have a favorite one?
Like of all time?
Yeah.
I would say Fletch.
Oh cool, it's a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you see a fourth Hangover movie being made?
Possibly but I dont know which actor would do it.
I think they would all get back together.
I dont think so, the third one bottomed out.
They used the same jokes the entire time.
Yeah that and the acting was campy.
I think Ed Helms is overrated and boring.
He is type-caste and needs to embrace that
I wouldnt want to but I guess so
He makes enough royalties to not need the other stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Groundhog Day is in the news these days.
Yes, they have made it into a Broadway musical.
It has a good premise that would be suited to becoming a play.
I wonder if Bill Murray has seen it?
Well he is a difficult person to follow in that role.  He did a great job.
Yes, to have to reenact the same scenes over and over again.
Interesting fact, it didn't do too well at box office when it was first released.
I wonder why.  It has all the elements to be a classic.
Yes, especially when "I got you Babe" is played over and over!
Yes, and Andie MacDowell.  I love her in all her movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?
I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever.
You think so, how come?
Well, Superbad is super funny.
You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious.
I didn't know that you saw Superbad before.
I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out. I love Michael Cera.
I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie. I especially loved the scenes at the party.
I was laughing hysterically the whole time; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards.
That's exactly how I felt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bridesmaids is probably one of my favorite movies of all time.
I like it too. That part where they all got food poisoning had me almost crying it was so funny.
I thought that scene was great too! I liked the scene where Kristen Wiig's character was trying to give a speech in Spanish.
I know, that scene was hilarious! I thought all the actresses were great in that movie.
I feel like Melissa McCarthy became famous because of that movie.
Did you know her husband is in Bridesmaids too?
No, who was he?
He was the security guard on the airplane.
I never realized that! That's kind of cool.
Yeah, I think I saw that online somewhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Gene Wilder film?
Blazing Saddles
I've heard about that one.
It's one of his best. His character is very funny.
Yeah, do you remember his name?
The Waco Kid
Yeah, he did that role amazingly
Who directede Blazing Saddles
Mel Brooks
Oh yeah. He does tons of comedy films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last thing you saw Adam Sandler in?
I've been watching his new movies on Netflix.
I don't think I've seen any of them.
You have to watch them, especially The Do Over.
What si that one about.
He's a secret agent and gets help from David spade, but David is this loser guy from his high school.
It sounds more like an action movie.
Adam makes it funny. He's basically the same as he would be in real life, but with cool spy moves.
Well David Spade and Adam Sandler is a great place to start for big comedy.
And this movie certainly delivers on that bill.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Seth Rogen movie?
Has to be Knocked Up.
That was the original but hes done better
Like what?
Neighbors
That was a great movie.
Yeah and even Pineapple Express
No I dont think that was better than Knocked Up
It 100% was better
Youre crazy I cant get behind that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love comedies.
What is your favorite comedy?
I love the Austin Powers movies.
Oh yeah! Mike Myers is so funny.
That scene in the tent was hilarious!
Yes it was. How about the one where he was naked behind all of the props?
That one was good, too.
Did you like Wayne's World?
Yes! That was such a funny take on teens in the eighties.
Garth was funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Ghostbusters?
That one is all women, right?
Yeah it's totally female actors.
Talk about girl power!
Absolutely. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig are fabulous in this. Actually all the main actresses are.
I like that it's similar to the original Ghostbusters but more modern.
I know what you mean. I do miss that Slimer didn't play as big of a part.
I noticed that too.
But I do love that Chris Hemsworth is their male bimbo.
I that that was awesome too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Ghostbusters movie was some kind of awful.
I don't think so.  It was pretty solid?
No way.  They completely ruined the original.
It had nothing to do with the original.
Really?  Same basic characters?
Well, kind of.
Plus the original cast made cameos.
Maybe.
No maybe about it.
I think somebody should remake you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Other Woman is such a funny movie.
That's the one with Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, right?
That's right. Do you enjoy their movies?
Oh yes. Leslie Mann plays neurotic characters very well.
You're right. She was great in Knocked Up as Debbie.
I liked her in Big Daddy, too. That was the first movie I ever saw her in.
Really? It's been awhile since I watched an Adam Sandler movie.
I love his movies. They always make me laugh.
They are pretty funny. Happy Gilmore is my favorite Adam Sandler movie.
That's a good one. The cameo by Bob Barker always cracks me up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Airplane?
Yes it was quite funny?
You like Leslie Nielsen?
Yes he's ok.
He reminds me of my deceased dad.
Really that is something.
My dad was quite funny.
I like funny dads.
Did you see the Airplane with Anna Nicole?
Yes that one was good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Office Space?
No - is it any good?
Yes, it's great!
I'm going to have to watch that one!
I would even consider it a classic comedy.
Really? Why is that?
I just think it has some really unforgettable characters.
Who is in it?
Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston
I like both of them, I'd love to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
What was the last comedy you saw?
I watched Baywatch in the theaters.
Is that a comedy?
Yeah I would say it was mostly supposed to be comedy.
Oh I thought it was an action movie.
That's the way it was marketed, but it was a bit of both.
Oh that's interesting.  How was it?
Very bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder which comedy made the most money?
Of all time? Global revenues?
Yes. of all time globally, which comedy film, a single or a franchise, has made the most money?
Easy. The Shrek series. Made over 1.4 billion.
All that for a green whatever he is.
He's an ogre.
If we don't count the sequels. which movie made the most?
Also easy, 1984 Ghost busters. Over 600 million adjusted for inflation.
That was a great movie. The ruined it by remaking it...
And it wasn't even funny. Just stupid men hating misandrists. A lot of people hated it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Clueless?
Yes! That movie was hilarious!
I agree. Alicia Silverstone was great as a snotty teenager. As was Stacey Dash.
But it's so funny how stuck in the 1990s it is.
Yeah, but the Breakfast Club has the same issue I guess.
So will Mean Girls in a decade or two.
But a good teen comedy is timeless in its own way.
Agreed. I still bust a gut when I watch Clueless.
That said, the ending was a little icky.
I know! She starts dating her former step-brother!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bud, have you seen elf?
Oh no,  I can't watch will Ferrell movies.
Oh ok,  well who's your favorite comedy actor then?
Probably paul Rudd, he's so dry sometimes it can be hilarious!
Yeah he's great,  I loved him in role models.
That movie was awesome! The little kid was so funny.
Yeah,  and did you know that the laire kid was also in super bad?
Oh yeah,  that's right,  he was mclovin! I had forgotten that.
We should totally watch superbad tonight.
Sure thing, I'll bring the popcorn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They're having a Monte Python marathon on TV.
Really? When?
This weekend.
Oh, man! I love those movies!
You should come over.
I thought you'd never ask!
Which one is your favorite?
Holy Grail, of course!
That's mine too!
I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I swear First Wives Club is the funniest movie in the world.
No way, the best comedy is Mean Girls.
Oh, that's a great movie. Tina Fey is so talented.
She wrote it, right?
Yeah, she wrote it and produced it, I think.
I absolutely love Rachel McAdams at the queen bee.
She was great as was Lindsay Lohan.
And who would have thought that Amanda Seyfried would blossom into this major star.
She deserves it. She's really talented.
And she was so funny as Karen in Mean Girls!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Shaun of the Dead.
Yeah! Great movie!
Huh, I'd never heard of it till just now.
You have to watch it!
"A romantic comedy with Zombies"?!
Not so much on the romance side. Heavy on the zombies though.
I'm not really into zombies.
It's a total spoof. You have to see it.
OK. I'll give it a shot.
You won't be dissapointed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
i think, of all the genres, comedy changes the most, if you ask me.
Um, I don't think so. Sci Fi changes the most.
Oh, yeah, you're right. With all the effects and CGI and everything.
Yep, we can still laugh at comedies from the 70s. Sci fi from the 70s look silly.
Tell that to all the start trek fans.
Star trek is not merely a sci fi. It's a part of Americana.
Whatever. anyway. I think humor in the 70s were different from now. Look at Woody Allen's movies.
Well, that's not really representative of 70s comedy. That's just Woody Allen. And he's the one who set the standards for the romatic comedy genre
And I don't like romatic comedies. it's usually acted badly, even with famous comedians. Look at Billy Crystal movies. He has a weird awkward cadence.
And that will be the charm of Billy Crystal. he just acts that way. He talks that way in real life too. So it becomes believable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like David Spade?
I find his shows irritating
How about the movies he has been in?
They havent been terrible
Tommy Boy was great
So was Black Sheep
How about the newer stuff?
Like Grown Ups?
Yeah or Joe Dirt
Ehh they were alright nothing I would watch again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch this? Mike and Dave need wedding dates?
I don't know, what's it about.
It's actually pretty good. It's Zach Efron and the guy from Workaholics, and they are kind of crazy so they hire dates for their sisters wedding.
Okay, so who are the dates?
It's actually Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick. It's funny because they turn out to be just as crazy as the guys.
How so? Are they like party animals?
Yeah, and they just have a tendency to screw things up like the brothers.
This actually seems like a pretty good movie. i haven't seen a movie like this before.
It's not bad, there are a lot of really funny bit's in it.
Yeah let's watch it. I love Aubrey Plaza.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the 40 year Old Virgin?
That movie is hilarious!
Yeah, Steve Carrel is super funny.
What was your favorite part of the movie?
I think it had to be when he was getting his chest waxed.
Wow, yeah, that was great.
I think he ad-libbed what he was saying for that part.
That would make sense.
Yeah, especially since none of it made sense.
Yeah, the words he was making up were super funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you rather watch a silly comedy or a romantic comedy?
It really depends on my mood. I most like silly comedies.
So maybe something like Happy Gilmore or the Waterboy?
Pretty much anything with Adam Sandler or Will Farrell works for me!
I'm much more into romantic comedies, but sometimes I like the classic goofier ones.
Have any examples?
Anything done by Mel Brooks, like Spaceballs!
That movie is so funny! Rick Moranis as a Darth Vader clone is genius.
I know, they couldn't have done that movie any better.
They should really do a sequel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Do you watch many comedies?
Movies or TV?
Movies.
Yeah I would say I watch a fair few.
Any standouts that you've watched lately?
I saw some good stand up on netflix, that count?
I guess so.
Bill Burr's new stand up special was fantastic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
I would have to go for Ricky Bobby.
Taladegha Nights?
Yes, about racing.
The Nascar film. Sasha Baron Cohen was in it right?
Yes, pre-Borat. He was kind of the bad guy, but nor really.
I like the part where he tries to make Ricky Bobby say he likes crepes.
And the other guy calls them "Really, really thin pancakes".
Right, so funny.
Then he breaks Ricky's arm.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, what movie do you put in when you're in a bad mood and need a laugh?
I think I've seen Caddyshack about 100 times.
So good! Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield are amazing in that movie.
Haha, both of them were improvising a lot of their lines. That's a great formula for comedy gold, get funny people and let them do their thing.
It's like coaching a super talented basketball team, give them a little structure and get out of the way.
Another one from that era that I love is Airplane.
Another classic. I think Airplane might have better jokes, but the characters are better in Caddyshack.
I think that's a fair way to describe it. Although Kareem playing the pilot was pretty memorable and hilarious.
And Leslie Nielsen is going to make me laugh, no matter what movie it is.
Can't disagree with you there. Throw in the Naked Gun movies as other all time classics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So which comedy is your favorite?
I love Blazing Saddles.
What is that about?
It's about a black sheriff who comes to a town full of racists and they all come to love him.
It's a comedy?
Yep.  Mel Brooks directed it.
It sounds kind of dull.
It's not - it's hilarious.  There's tons of slapstick and the sheriff is a great straight man.
When did it come out?
Back in 1974.  It's pretty old by now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen central intelligence?
With kevin hart?
Yea and the rock
Yes it was a funny movie
It was so wierd seeing the rock being geeky
It was, it suprised me
He played the part well though
Yes he did
I hope they make another one
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Baseketball was an underrated movie.
Wasn't that the one movie by those one guys?
That's informative.  Who are you are thinking of?
The South Park guys.
Oh, you mean Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
Yep, those guys.
It was kind of a dud at the box office, but had some great jokes.
Also had Jenny McCarthy.
Oh, I remember her.  She's beautiful!
Yeah, I totally fell in love with her back then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Tropic Thunder?
Yes, it is hilarious.
Who is your favorite character?
I like Tom Cruise in it.
He is great. What did you think of Ben Stiller?
I am a big Simple Jack fan.
Did you like the intro to the movie?
Yes, the trailers were all really funny.
Have you seen any other movies with Ben Stiller?
Yes, so many. Zoolander, Reality Bites and many more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite comedy actor?
Easy question, Owen Wilson.
What movie of his is your favorite?
Again, easy answer...Wedding Crashers.
Why is that your favorite?
The plot, the actors and the role Owen played as a wedding crasher.
Do you have a favorite sports comedy?
Yes, it would have to be Caddyshack.
Why Caddyshack?
Rodney Dangerfield is hilarious in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Old School?
Classic!  I liked Will Ferrell in it so much
One of his best movies!  And an early apperance by the guy who plays Howard on the Big Bang Theory.
I like Luke Wilson in it too.
One of his rare moments of being funny.
I am so glad they didn't make a sequel.
I agree.  Bad sequels are the worst.
Oh, and Vince Vaughn is great in that movie.
Yeah, an early gem for him.
One of my favorite actors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any comedies from the 1990s?
I have seen plenty. That was a great time for comedy.
What is your favorite from that decade?
I think I would have to say Dumb & Dumber.
I love that movie! Jim Carrey is amazing in it.
Yes, the cross country road trip he takes with the other character provides a backdrop for so many hijinks.
What is the name of the other main character again? I always forget his name
Jeff Daniels plays opposite of Jim Carrey in this movie.
They are an excellent team. They probably had a really fun time making that movie.
I agree. They seem like they get along really well and have great chemistry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of john C reilly
Who is that
He is a comedy actor
Well name a movie he was in
He was in step brothers
He is pretty amusing
He plays with will farrel alot
They do make a good combo for hilarity
I want them to make another movie like  that
It was pretty funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
A good comedy would be great right now.
I agree, we should pick one out to watch.
That sounds fun, what do you have in mind?
I love Adam Sandler movies! Want to watch one of his?
That would be great. Do you have Big Daddy?
No, sorry I sure dont. I have Mr.Deeds though.
I saw that one a long time ago. I remember liking it a lot!
Yea it is a really good movie.
Most of his movies are really entertaining.
They sure are!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Best comedy movie to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars?
There aren't that many.  Comedies are mostly ignored by the Academy.
Why?
I guess they figure making people laugh is easy and doesn't deserve recognition.  But if you make them cry while some kid stands up to a bully while dancing ballet and being raised by a single mother in World War II.. then you've accomplished something.
Tootsie is really funny and it got nominated for Best Picture.
Yeah but it didn't win.
A lot of good movies don't win, not just comedy movies.
Yeah but they're usually better than the ones who do.
Do you think we'll ever see a Will Ferrell movie or Jim Carrey movie get nominated for Best Picture?
Hahahahaha, not a chance
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoy comedies
Me too.
Have you seen a million ways to die in the west?
Yes, it was so funny.
I didnt think id like it, but it was great
They need more movies like that
Yea it was one of those movies, that's so stupid its funny,
One of my favorite parts was the part about the pictures
Yea that was great
It was funny the entire movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really liked the movie 21 Jump Street. Did you see it?
No, was it funny?
Yeah, it was probably one of my new favorite movies.
Is Jonah Hill in that?
Yeah, he's one of the main guys.
I liked him in Superbad.
I never saw that. I heard it was kind of crude.
Yeah, it was a bit, but it was still funny.
Maybe I'll have to watch it sometime.
Yeah, you definitely should.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite movie, a funny one?
It has to be, Something About Mary.
Is that the one with Cameron Diaz?
Yes!!  I love her she is so funny.  She totally cracks me up!
Me too!  My favorite part is when she gets the 'hair gel' stuck in her hair.
That part was so funny!  I almost died when she answered the door with her hair sticking up.
And what about when Ben Stiller gets his "thing" stuck in his pants zipper?
I totally forgot about that part, so funny!
Oh I know he cracks me up, but  Cameron Diaz did the best job in this film.
I agree.  She makes this movie a must-see comedy classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What comedy movie is one of your favorites?
Deadpool
What was one of the things that made it your favorite?
The casting of Ryan Reynolds........when it comes to sarcasm, he's the one.
Do you have another comedy movie you like?
Actually any of the Avenger's movies
Any particle one?
Any where all of the Avengers are in them.
Any Lego versions?
LEGO's Batman........but I'd warn it's not for children.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite comedy?
Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
The tv show?
No, the movie silly!
Who was in that one?
Matthew Broderick, based in Chicago
Oh yeah, they ditched school and played around in Chicago
Yes, that's it
I liked the Ferrari in that one
Yes, that was one smooth ride
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Bad Santa?
Yes that was funny
I liked that one a lot. Billy Bob Thorton was great in that movie.
He was. That kid was so cute also.
Did you see the second one?
No.
Neither have I.
We will both have to watch it to see if it is any good.
I looked it up it isn't rated as all but still looks good.
I will watch it when I get a chance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to watch Lego Movie.
Yeah. I took my boy to see it when it came out.
Awesome show.
I went just for my kid, but ended up really enjoying it.
Me too! I thought it'd be a lot of CGI.
It was!
Huh? It looks like stop motion.
I thought so too. There must have been some though.
I'll have to watch it again.
I've seen it about 3 time myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to only watch one comedy movie for the rest of your life, what would it be?
Umm...probably Zoolander.
Haha! Excellent choice!
Yea, Zoolander is such a classic. I honestly don't think I've seen a more original and outrageous comedy.
Yea, like the whole concept of the movie is so incredibly stupid but so brilliantly smart at the same time.
I love it how Will Ferrell was in that movie before he was super famous. It's funny to re watch it and see him play Mugatu.
Yea, he was hilarious!
Did you see the second Zoolander movie?
Yea...not a fan. It was basically just a sad attempt to copy the first.
Yea, it felt like it was a parody of the first movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you ever heard of the movioe Loose Cannons?
No, I have not not.
Well, it stars both Dan Aykroyd and Gene Hackman as cops.
Those two in the same film? What's the plot?
Gene is a old cop whose lost all patience with the world, while Dan is a genius former FBI type who lost his mind after being captured and tortured by a drug cartel.
And this is supposed to be a comedy?
Yeah, because when ever Dan gets scared or stressed, he becomes a revolving door of multiple personailities.
Mulitiple Personalities? Like who?
Like the Cowardly Lion and Doorthy, to Butch Cassidy and even the Road Runner.
Okay, that sounds kind of funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Bad Moms?
Oh my gosh, yes it was hilarious!
I know!  I couldn't stop laughing.
Mila was the best!
Really? I loved Kristin Bell.
I just think the whole concept was perfect.
I know, it's so hard being a mom.
Yes, they really touched on that.
It was the greatest moms night out movie
I went with my friends too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
I love Neighbors.
I have seen that one that is a great one.
Yes, did you see part 2 yet?
No, I haven't.
Me either.
What other comedy movies do you like?
I like Pineapple Express.
That is a good one. I like that too.
James Franco is awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, comedies. Will we ever get a good one again?
Every year someone says "no really, ____ was good." I go to see it and its stale garbage.
Hah, I know the feeling. Doesn't matter who is starring.
The problem is that the main people churning them out are just stale. Feig, Apatow, anything with Seth Rogen.
I'm with you there. But even the indie scene has been a failure recently!
The last good comedy I saw was The Overnight.
Wasn't crazy about it, though I did laugh.
We need another Obvious Child, In Another World, and so on. Just, something
It's possible that the best comedies are being made elsewhere. I need to check outside the US
Good call. I can't stomach another raunchy crap fest
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about comedy movies.
Sounds great.
I love every melissa mccarthy movie
She is so funny
She is and a great actress
Her movies are good
The Heat is one of my favorites
Mine too and i liked The Boss
And Tammy was funny
I liked that one too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
You know I love those old movies from the 1980's. All I have to say is Caddy Shack.
Yeah, that's one of my favorites too. What about Ferris Bueller's Day Off? Gremlins, Airplane.
Yep, those were good ones. What about Ghost Busters and Airplane.
The humor was different then. I think in some ways we were allowed to laugh at eveyone.
Yeah, things are so PC now. Though I have to say did you see Key and Peele in Keanu?
Those guys are so funny. I would watch them in anything!
So I guess you saw them in Storks and Wanderlust?
Yeah, the wolf scenes are so funny. I don't remember the other.
Well it was worth watching them for the wolves. Hope they do something new soon. Those guys are so irreverently funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you watch a lot of comedies?
Yeah I do actually.
What's the best one you've seen recently.
I watched one on netflix with Adam Sandler that was really good.
What was it called?
Sandy Wexler.
Oh I saw that it was on netflix haven't watched it yet.
It was very well done I thought.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you get to see Snatched yet?
No I haven't , it looks great.
I will be going to see it this weekend. I love Goldie Hawn and Amy Schumer, I am sure they are going to be fantastic.
I know , I can't even believe Goldie is acting again, it has been some time since her last film.
She does great comedy films. Wanda Sykes is also in this film too.
What time does the movie play?
It starts around 1pm, do you think you will have this weekend off?
I think I have to work that day, I will have to check on it.
Maybe you can come with me!
I will call you and let you know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the greatest comedy movie of all time?
I don't think there is one.
Why don't you think there is one?
Comedy is so subjective.
Well, I think Half-Baked is the greatest comedy movie of all time.
Even Dave Chappelle doesn't think that movie is as funny as it could have been.
It has everything.
Just because it has marijuana humor.
That's the best kind of humor.
I think that is very subjective.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So hey, what did you do this weekend?
Oh man, I totally had a John Hughes movie weekend.
John Hughes. Didn't he do Christmas Vacation?
Oh yeah! One of Chevy Chase's classic movies.
Wow so you really took it back to the 80s this weekend?
For sure man. Early roles for some big name actors, like John Galecki and Juliette Lewis.
My favorite was Auntie Ruth.
Hahaha, right, with the cat wrapped up like a Christmas present?
Dude, my favorite part is the Uncle. When they're asking her to say grace, and he's like...
The BLESS-ING. hahaha that's great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Had you ever seen Napoleon Dynamite?
Yeah. What a weird show.
Did you know it was filmed in Idaho?
No way!
Sure was.
I'm from Idaho!
I know that's why I'm telling you.
I had no idea. I'll have to give it another watch.
I own it. Would you like to borrow?
Please!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you didn't like Elf!?
I mean I did, I wasn't super into it.
Why not?
I think it was because it was a holdiday movie.
You don't like holdiay movies?
Not really, they're so lame most of the time.
So are you saying that you don't like the Home Alone movies?
Actually, those are exceptions haha. I love all of those,
Same! They're classics!
They are. & I watched them as a kid, so they're nostalgic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish we had something funny to watch!
We do actually! I just bought Dumb and Dumber.
Seriously? That is one of my all time favirotes!
I love Jim Carey movies!
Me and you both! He is great.
Have you ever seen Liar Liar?
Yes! That is also a funny one.
Most of his movies are funny except for a few.
That is true. He is very talented.
No doubt about it. He is an all time great for sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a really good comedy movie from overseas?
Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Is that a new one?
No, it came out in the 70's.
Cool. What is it about?
King Arthur and his knights of the round table.
So, it is serious?
No, they make it very funny.
Who directed it?
Terry Gilliam
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Dumb and Dumber?
I never was a fan of any of the Dumb and Dumber movies?
Really?  You didn't find them to be funny?
Not really.  I don't really care for Jim Carey though.
Oh, I think he is hilarious!
Dumb and Dumber is just too repetitious and you don't have to think.
That's what's great about it.
I mean, whatever floats your boat.
You didn't like any of the sequels?
They were worse than the originals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have seen so many comedies.
I bet you have not seen all of them.
Try me.
Have you seen Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein?
No, I have not
Well, that is one of the funniest movies ever made and it also blends horror into it.
Who is in it?
Bud Abbot and Lou Costello.
When was it made?
In the late 40's. It's black and white.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie "Bridesmaids?"
Yes, it's one of my favorite comedies.
I saw it recently, and I really enjoyed Kristen Wiig.  I have seen her on Saturday Night Live before, but I had never seen her in a movie.
I think she may have had something to do with the writing of Bridesmaids.
I think so too.  The airplane scene is priceless.  "Help me, I'm poor."  That was so funny.
And you just can't beat Melissa McCarthy as the groom's sister.
Did you know that McCarthy's real life husband is in the movie?  I think he often has parts in her movies.
No!  Which character did he play?
He was the air marshall on the airplane; the one McCarthy's character interacted with.
Oh. That is so cool.  They were really funny together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Mean Girls?
I did, but it's not my favorite. I liked the SNL cast being in it though.
They really are funny. Did you see Baby Mama with Amy Poehler and Tina Fey?
Yes, that was hilarious.
When Amy Poehler puts on the fake pregnancy belly and dances I laugh so hard.
That was funny! How about when she stuck the gum under the coffee table?
That was great. Dax Shepherd, who played Carl made me laugh so hard.
Haha me too. When he was on the toilet listening to "Red, Red Wine" I couldn't stop laughing.
Haha so funny. And he got the ultrasound of the squirrel!
Haha yes! I mean it didn't even look like a human. Come on!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there!  Have you seen any good movies lately?
Not really.  I haven't been paying attention to movies lately.
Why is that?
Well, I'm a bit burnt out.  I get excited about new movies, and then they end up being terrible.
I can understand that; what you need is to watch some classic movies.  I like comedies myself.
I enjoy comedy movies.  What would you suggest?
Well, I know it's a bit lame now, but I've always enjoyed older Adam Sandler movies.
Oh yeah!  Like Happy Gilmore?
Yeah, that's a great one!  He plays a golfer with natural skill, and destroys the PGA tour with his loud mouth and skills.
That sounds like a good choice.  I'll give it a watch; thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could pick your favorite comedy movie, what would that be?
I love the movie "Bridesmaids."  I think it is so funny.
Who was your favorite character in it?
I thought Melissa McCarthy  was so funny.  She just doesn't care if she looks good or not.
I know.  That scene in the bridal shop was epic.
Hilarious.  I can't even imagine.
Wouldn't you hate to clean up that mess?
I think I would just burn the shop down and start over.
It was great.  There were so many funny scenes in it.
Yes, I would watch another movie that Kristen Wiig does.  She's super funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what the very first comedy movie was
These are not the type of question that can be answered.
Why not? It's simple. Which movie used humor mostly to entertain people?
Well, again. Genres came after the movies. We say a comedy movie, but that genre became a thing after many movies used humor in their content
So there has to be at least one movie that set that trend
Well, not really, because there could've been many movies from same time frame that did the same thing.
Either way there has to be some consensus as to the original comedy
if I was forced to say it, I'd say it's that french film. L'Arroseur Arrose, or the watered waterer.
Even the name's humorous.
yeah, it's was a bit of a slapstick comedy. Guy gets sprayed by his own water hose. But it's the start of the genre I'd say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good comedy I can watch tonight?
Teen Wolf with Michael J. Fox
Oh, that sounds great. He is always good in movies.
Yes he is. I like his character in Back to the Future.
Is Teen Wolf scary at all?
Not really. It is a pure comedy.
What is it about?
A teenager that turns into a werewolf.
Did he get bit?
No, he inherited it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
What was the last funny movie you saw?
Hmm let me think.
Take your time.
I saw Old School on tv the other day.
ah cool.
it was great, hadn't watched it in a while.
It's a modern day classic.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good movie about airplanes?
I would suggest the movie Soul Plane.
Soul Plane sounds great. Is it a drama?
Nope. It is a comedy starring Snoop Dogg.
Snoop Dogg on a plane? That sounds like a disaster!
It is. There are plenty of bad things that happen but it is a funny movie.
Would you suggest that I watch this with my kids?
I wouldn't there are some dirty scenes.
That is too bad. I will check it out with my wife late at night though.
You should. There are many unforgettable scenes you have to say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Bad Santa?
No I haven't? What is that?
Billy Bob Thorton plays a thief who pretends to be Santa.
That is crazy! Why would he do that?
He uses his position as Santa to rob a mall.
That is crazy! Is anyone else in this?
Bernie Mac is in it. He was great.
Wow! I am so sad that he is gone.
It is sad that he died. You should remember the good things he did though.
I will. I will have to check this movie out now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't remember the last time I have seen a good comedy film.
I know.  I think the newer comedy films haven't been anything special.
In the 90s, you had tons of good comedy films like The Nutty Professor or Ace Ventura.
Eddie Murphy was a comic genius around that time.  So was Jim Carrey.
I think as these stars get older, they become less interested in having a big hit film.
I think Eddie Murphy could make another hit movie if he really wanted to.
He could.  I would love to see a Golden Child sequel.
That movie was before my time, but I saw it on television the other day.  I love the storyline.
It was a fun movie that mixed comedy and action with the supernatural.  A bit similar to "Big Trouble in Little China" with Kurt Russell.
Those movies are very similar!   I think Golden Child was a funnier film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know any good comedy movies?
Clean or dirty?
Dirty!
Well I like Superbad
Do you know any recent ones?
I heard Dirty Grandpa was good
How good?
I'd say it's like 9/10 or so. Critics dont like it as much
But knowing you, if you like it then I would too
I'd watch it again, let's go rent it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like comedy movies?
Yes, they are my favorite genre of movies.
Which movie do you like right now?
I really like 'fist fight'
I saw that two weeks ago and it was amazing.
What did you like about that movie?
I really liked how the two starts worked so good together.
Ice cube was amazing AGAIN in this movie.
It was so funny it had me laughing the entire time.
I wish they will created a sequel to this great movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Seen any good comedies lately?
It's been a bit, but I've seen a couple that made me laugh a lot, like Dodgeball.
I remember that one!  "If you can dodge a wretch, you can dodge a ball!"
Yeah, Billy Bob Thornton really made that film!
Any others?
Well, I saw Trainwreck and Masterminds, neither of which I cared to much for.
Oh, you gonna jump on the anti-Amy Schumer bandwagon?
No, no... I mean, I like some of her standup, but for some reason this film didn't really do it for me.
Masterminds... what was that about?
This guy who works as a armored car guard is convinced by a girl he liked to rob the place.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Why Him?
No I haven't? Whats it about?
It is about a family visiting their daughter and her eclectic boyfriend for the holidays.
That sounds interesting. So I'm assuming there is some crazy stuff that happens.
Oh ya. When I say eclectic I mean it.
Who plays in it?
It stars James Frano and Bryan Cranston.
Oh that has to be good then. They are both hilarious.
Ya it is. It is definitely not to be watched with children though.
Oh ok. Thanks for the heads up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen sex tape?
Yes, i didnt think it was that funny
It was and it wasnt
To me it was more creepy
Yea exactly because that little kid was behind it allit was a very wierd movie
Definitely but parts were funny
Yea,but it was wierd that they brought their kids to break into pornhub
That was so wierd
Im still suprised they didnt make a second movie
I kind of am too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
Probably, Happy Gilmore, Adam Sandler really hits the mark with that one.
I liked that a lot too. I also liked Happy Gilmore.
All of his early movies are great.
Do you remember Airheads?
Yes! Wasn't Brendan Fraser in that one?
He was and so was Steve Buscemi.
Adam Sandler was such a lovable oaf in that movie.
He was, even though they were breaking the law, you still rooted for them.
I was so happy they won in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Do you watch a lot of comedy movies?
Yeah love comedies.
What's the last one you saw?
I saw Neighbors 2.
What did you think?
Honestly, it was pretty mediocre.
That's what I heard from some of my friends that saw it.
I wouldn't recommend it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the new CHIPS movie?
The one with Dax Shepard and Michael Pena?
That's the one. I just watched it today and feel lukewarm about it.
Is it considered an action or a comedy?
I would say it's an action comedy in the buddy cop mold. It tried to be really funny and witty with its jokes, physical humor, and situation comedy but I felt it was really flat and oddly paced.
Is Kristen Bell in this movie? She's always in movies with her husband Dax.
Yes Kristen Bell is in here, small role for her, and she's really unlikable. I think the movie did a good job with the action and some of the chemistry element between Michael Pena and Dax but overall there seems to be so much out of place and forced.
That's a shame to hear. I remember watching the trailers, and hearing the original TV Show theme song and thinking wow this is going to be a nostalgia blast.
I think they did a good job for some of the homage to the TV series, as there is a cameo from Erik Estrada, the original Ponch.
Well at least it has the original Ponch going for it. I'm sure if you were a fan of the original TV show you might get a kick out of this new movie even though as you described it, as not being perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Lego Batman?
Just last night.
What did you think?
Hillarious!
I know! I didn't think it could compare to Lego Movie, but I was wrong.
Will Arnet is just perfect for the role.
I didn't know that was him....
Sure was!
He is stupendous!
Made the movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good funny movies lately?
Yes, I sure did yesterday. It was hilarious.
What was the name of it?
Fist Fight
What was it about?
School teachers get in a fight and it's totally epic around the school.
Who stars in it?
Ice Cube and that little funny guy from horrible bosses. Tracey Morgan, some funny chick from Saturday night live.
So how does it end?
They keep their job and fight after school anyways.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever see This is the End?
Yes, great movie.
I love James Franco he used to be on my soap opera.
What soap opera?
General Hospital.
What role did he play on there?
Franco.
Was he a bad guy?
Oh yes for sure.
I wish I could have seen it I like him like you do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like comedy movies?
Yes i love them
They are so fun and uplifting,
Yes, i really enjoy watching them when im down or just anytime.
Me too
And the actors in comedy movies are great
Yes my favorite comdey actor is robin Williams
Hes good, my favorite is kevin hart
He is hilarious
I love watching his movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Mrs. Doubtfire?
Oh, that was one of my favorite Robin Williams movies!
I loved the accent he had as Mrs. Doubtfire!
Yes, it sounded so funny when Mrs. Doubtfire was explaining how her husband was killed.
I liked that part where he didn't have his makeup.
Oh, didn't he smash his face in a pie?
Yeah, before everyone walked in.
All that to see the kids.
Why couldn't he see his kids in the first place?
I really don't remember.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good comedy movies lately?
This year? No. I did see that new Ghostbusters movie, but I don't recommend it.
Oh yeah? Why not?
In my opinion they butchered the franchise. It's literally a gender bend of the original film but much worse.
If it's just a gender sawp how could they of made it worse?
Well for one it's overly charged with feminist undertones. Every singe guy in the film is portrayed as a total moron.
Well how is the comedy aspect of the film? Was there nothing funny about the movie at all?
It had one or two funny points but it really didn't save the movie at all.
It sounds like a movie I might watch when it airs on netflix or something.
I wouldn't waste your time honestly. If you liked the original you will hate this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Paul Blart Mall Cop movie?
You mean there's a second one?
Yes. It's funny.
Is it on DVD?
Don't know. We streamed it.
The first one was hilarious.
It was, he's a great actor.
He is.
Check if you can rent it.
I will, it's got to be good like the first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite animated movie?
I'd have to say Ratatouille.
That was a good one.
Pretty funny for a kids flick.
I really loved the food critic.
Oh yeah, Ian Mckellen!
What a great voice.
Loved him in Lord of the Rings.
How about X-Men?
Almost forgot. Magnetto!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Animal House?
I have seen it many times. It is a classic comedy film.
It really paved the way for so many comedies to come.
John Belushi is incredible in that film. He was such an amazing actor.
He is great. But my favorite actor in the film is John Vernon.
What year was the movie originally released? It still really holds up!
It originally came out in 1978.
I think that critics said it was one of the best films of the year when it first came out.
I believe it! Some magazines ever call it one of their 50 most influential movies because of how many other films it inspired.
It really was a groundbreaking movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the movie Friday?
Is that the one with Ice Cube?
Yes, where he gets fired from his job and a drug dealer wants to kill him.
That movie is hilarious. Its one of my favorite comedy movies of all time.
I really like it too. Its a great stoner flick.
Ice Cube has done so much in his lifetime.
I know right, from being a great rapper to being a movie star.
Did you ever listen to his old school rap music?
Of course I have, who hasn't?
Haha, good point. I love his music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Jim Carrey fan?
Yeah, I always liked his movies.
I watched Yes Man recently.
How was the movie?
It was good. He started saying yes to everything.
Wow, his life must have changed alot.
He broke out of his slumber of office life.
Who else was in the movie?
Bradley Cooper was his best friend.
Oh really, I see him in lots of movies now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Kevin Hart has really gotten popular over the last few years.
I heard he was pretty funny in Get Hard with Will Ferrell.
I heard that, too. He's been in quite a few movies recently.
I want to see the movie that came out last year with Ice Cube. What's it called again?
Oh, you're thinking of Ride Along 2. My sister told me the first one was hilarious.
I hope so. Ice Cube was just in another comedy movie, too.
Yeah, he starred in Fist Fight with Charlie Day.
Ice Cube was in the 21 Jump Street movies as well.
That's right. I forgot about that.
Now that I'm thinking about it I never realized he was in so many comedy movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you watch comedies?
Yeah sure.
Do you have a favorite one that was released in the last few years?
Let me think.
Sure.
I really liked 21 jump street they remade.
That was really funny.
Yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Had you ever seen Ace Ventura?
No, I actually never did.
Oh, it was hilarious.
I just never was a Jim Carey fan.
There was a part with a rhino that was great!
Yeah, in middle school everyone talked about that part.
You didn't think it was funny?
Even as a kid I thought it sounded stupid.
Maybe that kind of humor isn't your thing.
I guess not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish their were movies like the old ones
What sort do you mean
Well i miss funny movies you know
I mean some are still funny
Nothing can compare to zoolander series
Their was a show based on the movie
That was bad by comparison
I can agree
I wonder if we will ever get a new one
I highly doubt it based on how old he is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are your favorite comedy movie actors?
I love Adam Sandler! He is great!
I love any of his movies especially when Drew Barrymore is his costar.
Oh me too.  The Wedding Singer was one of my favorites.
Yes that is a great one with some really funny moments.
Fifty First Dates was really funny too.
Yes I really liked that one as well.
Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore really work well together.
They sure do, they have been in a lot of movies together.
They seem to have a great chemistry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's such a shame that the Joe Dirt sequel wasn't as funny as the first one.
I know. The first one is so funny.
David Spade always makes me laugh.
One of his more underrated movies is Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.
I'll have to see that one some time.
You really should. Another great movie he starred in is Tommy Boy.
I totally agree. It's so weird seeing how young he looks in that movie.
Oh I know, and his character is such a buzz kill.
Yep, Chris Farley's character definitely contrasted with David Spade's.
I think the interactions and relationship between their characters is what makes the movie so memorable and lovable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Hangover movies?
I only saw the first one.
Why didn't you see them all?
I actually didn't like it.
I thought everyone like the Hangover!
Everyone else in the room was killing themself laughing.  I just didn't thing the movie was funny.
Did you like anything about the movie?
I thought the guy with the beard was funny?
That Zach guy?
Yeah, Zach Galifianakis.  The movie overall sucked though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Zoolander? I really thought it was funny.
Which one? The first was funny. The second one not so funny.
Yeah the first one cracks me up....I love that blue steel.
Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson were so funny.
Yeah, I loved it when they were getting the info out of the computer.
Aww, man! I had that computer!
Oh and the hand model?
Wasn't that the dude from the X-files?
Yeah, man. That was so funny.
Bet there are real hand models that do that in California.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you seen Sisters?
No, I wanted to I love Amy Pohler
Then you would love the movie since she's in it with Tina Fey
Oh yeah! I love them together
Did you see Baby Mama?
Yes! They were hilarious
Well you should check the movie out then I think you'll like it
is it on HBO?
No, but I think you can get it on Netflix
Cool thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Will Ferrell movies?
I don't think I've seen a Will Ferrell movie that I didn't like.
Same here.  Anchorman is my favorite.
That's a good one!  Anchorman 2 was pretty bad though.
I thought it was okay.  It wasn't as good as the first, but I felt it still had some funny parts.
I just felt that they tried a little too hard.
Yeah you're probably right.  I feel that the first didn't really end in a way that would allow a very good sequel.
Have you seen Land of the Lost?  I felt that that was a pretty bad Will Ferrell movie.
I haven't seen it, but my girlfriend told me it was bad.
Yeah it's bad.  It was quite poorly written and I don't recall laughing out loud at any point during it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really liked that movie Deadpool.
Me too. Ryan Reynolds played the main character so well!
Yes, I was constantly laughing because of him.
I thought for sure it was going to end sad, but they made it into a pretty good ending too.
Did you ever see him in The Proposal?
You mean with Sandra Bullock? Yes, too funny!
Those two were a great team in The Proposal.
I liked the grandma in that movie, Betty White. She was so cute and funny.
She acts so innocent but she is not innocent at all!
Definitely one of my alltime favorite moves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Trading Spaces?
Is that an older movie?
Yeah, from the early 80s, I think.
Who was in it?
Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroid.
I'm not sure.  What was it about?
Well, a stockbroker and a homeless guy trade places with each other.  I think there was a bet made somewhere.
A bet?
Yeah, Murphy is the homeless guy and he has to do Akroid's job.  Likewise, Akroid has to make it on the streets.
I might have to see that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, if I'm going to watch a Marx Brothers movie -- I know I'm going to regret asking this, but -- where should I start?
Well, there's a question.
No, please. Just give me a title. Seriously.
Okay; people are going to tell you Duck Soup, but ignore them. Go with Night at the Opera.
Okay, Night at the Opera. Why?
First, it's easily their best movie just in terms of its writing, its direction, its setpieces. Second, the party of the second part shall be known as the party of the second part.
Oh, uh. So... I take it you're being referential again. Should I understand what you're saying?
Not really. Not yet.
This is why I never ask you anything.
You're really missing out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the old Airplane movies from the 70s?
I grew up on those movies! I love all the cute little puns.
Those were great movies and a little risque for their time.
I agree totally. Have you seen Bridesmaids?
That was hilarious. Melissa McCarthy is so funny it's ridiculous.
I loved her in The Boss. She really played that part well.
That's true. She took a little heat for her weight at the beginning but I think people see that her talent outweighs all that.
Absolutely true. I loved her in Ghostbusters.
Leslie Jones was really funny in that too. She's another one who's been criticized for her looks.
That's a shame. They're both really great talented actresses and extremely funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Don't Be A Menance.
No, I don't think I have. Who stars in it?
Marlon and Sean Wayons.
No. what is it about?
Its a movie about all different types of movie that happened.
Oh that sounds really fun to watch.
Yes you should check it out.
Marlon wayans is one of my favs can't beleive i havent seen this yet
You will never stop laughing , but beware i think its rated r dont let the kids watch.
Will do thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The world needs more of his movies
Whose movies
Adam sandler
What
The world needs more of his movies
Well i really disagree
Why though
Because he is a bad actor
That is blasphemy
Whatever you say
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Princess Bride?
Is that the movie with Andre The Giant in it?
Yeah that's the one.
That movie is pretty funny.
I just saw it last night.
You had never seen that before?
No, I watched it on Netflix.
Dude, that movie has been out since the 80s.
Do you want a peanut?
Don't start quoting a movie that is 30 years old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
Jackass always makes me laugh!
How about something a little more classy, like Mrs. Doubtfire?
I loved that movie!
Me too, Robin Williams was such an amazing actor/comedian.
I agree, he definitely left us too soon.
Well you know what they say about comedians right?
What's that?
They are only happy on stage, behind the curtain it's a bad depression.
Oh wow, that makes sense for him though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen barbershop?
Who is in it?
Ice cube and cedric the entertainer
I think i have
Its so funny
Whats your favorite part?
Where those two guys are trying to steal the atm the entire time
Oh yea i have seen ot, and the who drunk my apple juice
Its so funny
Yea it is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you like comedies?
Yeah sure who doesn't.
What's one that you watched recently that was really bad.
I watched Baywatch, that was pretty rough.
Oh yeah I heard the critics tore into it.
Yeah that's right.
The rock was on twitter trying to defend it, but it was a lost cause.
Yeah I saw that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know if I want to see that new Baywatch movie or not.
I'm not sure if I'm going to see it either.
It looked kind of silly, but I heard Zac Efron is in it.
Isn't he from High School Musical?
Yeah he is, but he looks a lot different now.
All I can think of when I think of Zac Efron is high school musical.
Zac Efron was good in Neighbors if you saw that.
I didn't see that yet. Is it worth a watch?
I think so if you like comedies.
Yeah I do. I think I'd like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Adam sandler is a great actor
He is, he is really funny
And i dont think hes ever had a bad movie me either
I love them all
Me too, i think i like billy madison best, or whos your daddy
Its so hard to pick, but i really like happy gilmore
Thats a good one too
Hes a great actor
I hope he makes more movies
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Hangover movie?
That's a tough one. They were all funny.
For me, it was the first one.
I would probably agree. The second and third one just seem to recycle the same jokes.
The third one was a huge disappointment.
I thought the one where they went to Bangkok was even worse.
That was definitely stupid they just thought it would be funny by putting it in Bangkok.
Plus the getting a tattoo like they did is over done.
Well, I'm just glad that they've stopped making them now.
Completely agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hello there
I want to go out tonight
To do what
Lets see a movie
You want to go to the theater?
Sure lets go
What do you want to watch
I need something to make me chuckle like a beaver
Well then we shall watch a comedy
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the funniest Pixar movie?
I would probably say the Cars franchise.
You must be crazy.  Those were awful.
No they weren't.  You didn't like Mater?
Of course not.  He's a bad caricature of a hillbilly.
You're reading way too much into this.
No I'm not.  He's a bad stereotype locked into a bad movie.
It's not a bad movie!  You just don't get humor.
I think you're the one who doesn't get it.  Cars?  Yuck.
'Get er dun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you call The Help a comedy?
Well it is really funny.
Yeah but it has just as much drama as it does comedy.
Then call it both.
But if you had to pick one
No rule says we have to.  Minnie is hilarious.  She steals every scene she's in.
She is definitely the star of the movie.
Oh yeah, especially the pie scene and her scenes Celia.
She's also really funny in Bad Santa
Yeah but she doesn't have many scenes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any comedies recently?
Not recently, the last one I saw was Keanu.
I loved Keanu! That kitten was so adorable.
Yea it was cute. The movie was hilarious too.
Yea Key and Peele are geniuses.
What was your favorite scene?
I loved when the guy did a backflip off the wall.
Oh yea! That was crazy.
What was your favorite?
I loved the George Michael songs in the van with the gangsters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the movie American Pie. Have you seen it?
Yes! That movie is comedy gold.
I thought Jason Briggs was so funny as Jim Levenstein. Who is your favorite?
My favorite character was Michelle Flaherty played by Alyson Hannigan.
She is funny. I really like her as an actress in general.
She was also in How I Met Your Mother and was really good.
All the characters are really good in this movie. I liked Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum to.
Wasn't she played by Tara Reid?
Yes she was!
Oh yea. I liked her too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I watched Haunted Mansion the other day.
Why did you do that?  I heard it was awful.
Sure was.  Just another poor movie choice by Eddie Murphy.
He's been in duds ever since the Beverly Hills Cops movies.
Well, he kind of sold out a bit.  Haunted Mansion was a pure money grab.
Disney was chucking cash at him, so I don't blame him.
I know what you mean.
I refuse to watch Haunted Mansion.  I don't want to waste my time.
You shouldn't.  Save yourself the trouble.
Consider it done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
I love Anchor Man
me too! the cast was amazing. I like Will Farrel
I do! But I thought Paul Rudd was hilarious.
Did you see him in the 40 Year Old Virgin? SO funny!
Yes that movie was great and so funny
I wish they had done a sequel
Yes, but what would they do for the story?
You're right maybe they have a baby?
Nah that wouldn't be funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever see Groundhog Day?
Yes that was a good one.
Living the same life everyday. Sometimes I feel that is me.
I know how you feel. It is boring sometimes.
Bill Murray was funny back then.
Yes he sure was.
Did you like him in Ghostbusters?
That was pretty good.
I like ghost movies. Even though it was a comedy.
I also like ghost movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy film?
I would say Ground hog's day.
That is an oldie but a goodie. Got to love bill murray.
It is such a well formatted movie. So much went into the thought process of the film.
It is interesting how he develops over time and learns all these new skills.
I love movie that deal with time. So interesting. Also bill murray is great.
His performance is so on the money. I also think andie macdowell made this film too.
Don't forget about chris elliot too, he is a comedic genius as well.
He is great. Loved him in something about mary.
Ya that was such a good comedy movie as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like watching Austin Powers?
Yeah, the movie was so ridiculous.
I know the costumes and humor was out there.
They wore such colorful clothes.
I liked when he went back in time.
Yeah, I always wondered how it would be back then.
Did you know Mike Myers was also Dr. Evil?
No, I actually didn't know that.
He didn't play Mini-Me though.
Oh wow, I was about to say...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Why Him?
That's the James Franco movie with Zoey Deutch and Bryan Cranston right?
That's the movie. I watched it yesterday and thought it was pretty funny.
What was it about because I love the actors in there.
It's a simple modern comedy. Zoey is off in college and makes a new boyfriend, James Franco. Her father played by Bryan Cranston, is unaware of her new boyfriend until he unexpectedly gets a surprise revealing she has a boyfriend.
I can imagine the crazy scene, James Franco is so off the wall especially in comedies. I still laugh at his role in Pineapple Express and Your Highness.
Oh you won't forget that scene! Basically Zoey's family decides to take a trip out to Palo Alto to visit her and that's when the fun begins, because they get to stay at James house and all the shenanigans happen.
Is James' character a student too?
No he plays a super rich billionaire founder for a video game company, so he basically has endless resources to spend to try to impress Zoey's family who happen to be very conservative.
This sounds hilarious. I remember the interviews I watched and some clips, thinking this is going to be great fun. I'll have to check out Why Him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Forgetting Sarah Marshall?
I did watch it on Netflix.
What did you think?
Extremely funny.  So many great lines and sight gags.
I couldn't believe some of the nudity though.
Yeah, that was pretty surprising.
I thought Mila Kunis was hilarious in it.
Yeah, I didn't expect her to have a comedic touch.
Being easy on the eyes helps too.
I'll say!
XXXXXXXXXXX
i think AFI's top comedy list is rigged
How do you figure that?
I don't like most of the films that's in the top ten.
That doesn't make IT rigged. Just makes you a bad movie fan
i don't think so. I am a very average movie fan. if I like a movie, it's likely others will too
Then why don't you like most the films in the top ten out of the 100 picked by the AFI?
I think of all the top 10 comedy picked by the AFI, the airplane is the best one. And they ranked it at 10th place
You're choosing the airplane over Dr Strangelove? That's just wrong man.
Dr. Strangelove sucked.
That's it. I'm out. I'm not talking to you anymore. I'm going to unfriend on facebook and ignore you for the rest of your life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish their was a comedy movie based like a sitcom
Is their not many like that
What do you mean
Like the setup
Like their not being any plot?
Yeah something like that
It would be interesting to make a movie like that
I could see that being something important
It could revolutionary
One of a kind to be honest
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you ever seen Keeping up with the Joneses?
Oh yea, with Zach Galifinakis right?
Yea! He was so funny in that movie.
Yea he was, not as funny as he was in The Hangover though.
Oh yea, the hangover is a classic!
Braley Cooper was really good in that too.
Yea Bradley Cooper is always amazing.
Yea especially in that movie Limitless.
Hey, who was the third guy in that movie anyway?
You know, I have no idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what the best super hero movie is
What do you mean
Well their is many of them
And?
So obviously their has to be a best one
It is not so simple as that
How so
Well one thing it is subjective?
Subjective?
Meaning it is of opinion not fact
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm thinking of going to see that Baywatch movie. What do you think of The Rock as a comedy actor?
I think he can be funny. He was pretty good in Central Intelligence.
Really, you think so? I think Kevin Hart had more funny lines.
Of course Kevin Hart had more funny lines. He is actually a comedian. But The Rock did a good job too.
Yeah, I think you are right. He is still getting his comedy acting chops.
Central Intelligence was good because he got to focus mostly on being an action star, doing stunts and fight scenes.
But wasn't it funny to see him wearing that fat suit?
It looked so fake. I could never see Dwayne Johnson as being chubby.
That was part of what made it hilarious.
That and his jheri curl. It was also weird to see Kevin Hart trying to be a nerd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are there any comedy movies with Jack Black that not many people know about?
Yes, Orange County is one you might like.
That sounds cool. Is Jack Black in it a lot?
He is not the main character, but he is a huge part of the movie.
Cool, I will check that one out.
He is also in The Cable Guy. But, his part is small.
I would like to see that since I want to see his early work too.
Orange County is very funny though. You will like it.
I hope so. What is it about?
A guy who gets rejected to a school and then he tries his best to get in, with Jack Black's help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you say is your favorite comedy director?
Mel Brooks, hands down.
I totally forgot about him.
How could you?!
Sacriledge, I know.
Young Frankenstein?
"It's Franken-steen!"
Hahaha! That was such a good one!
What about Blazing Saddles?
Another classic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like for a comedy actor?
Definitely jim carrey
I loved him in ace ventura pet detective
He is hilarious
Yes he is
I also like the mask and liar,  liar
Amd that you, me, and dupree movie
I didnt care much for dumb and dumber though
Me either
That one was a little too much
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the best comedic actor?
Wow, that's a good question.
I think Jim Carrey use to be.
Why don't you think he is now?
He became to serious once he did The Truman Show.
Have you seen that abomination called The Majestic?
No, me and the rest of the world have not seen The Majestic.
Oh, that movie is horrible.
Is it so bad it's good?
No, it's just bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the latest comedy movie you saw?
I just went to see the Elf.
Does that have Will Ferrel in it?
Yes it does!
He is very hilarious and my wife loves him.
I agree he is very funny.
We love all of his movies.
What movie has he starred in that is your favorite?
Probably Daddy's Home.
I agree, Daddy's Home is his best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
One of my favorites is Tommy Boy.
I loved that one. Chris Farley and David Spade worked great together.
Black Sheep wasn't quite as good, but I like that one too.
One of the more underrated comedies is PCU.
Who was in that?
Jeremy Piven and David Spade.
I remember now. That was really funny.
And still relevant in today's world, even if it is so 90s it hurts.
Spade never did much beyond the 90s. That was kind of his decade.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are we gonna watch tonight?
How about a comedy movie? I've got Ghostbusters, Space Jam, The Great Muppet Caper...
Which Ghostbusters? I heard there's a new one.
The original.
And Space Jam...that's the one with Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, right?
That's right.
Hmmm...I'm not sure whether I wanna see Space Jam or The Great Muppet Caper.
I've got a few others, if you wanna see.
Nah. I guess I'm in a Muppet mood.
Alright. The Great Muppet Caper it is, then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite comedian?
I would have to say Jim Carrey.
Haha, I love him. Especially in the move The Mask.
That movie is awesome. Its kind of cartoon-ish but still hilarious.
Do you remember the part where he makes a tommy gun out of a baloon?
Yes, that part was hilarious.
That's my favorite part of the entire movie.
My favorite part is when the dog puts on the mask and goes crazy.
Yeah that part is too funny. The dog comes to the rescue and saves the day.
Then at the end Jim Carey swallows the dynamite to stop the building from blowing up. So clever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
Um, it's a toss up between Black Sheep and Tommy Boy.
Classic! I love Chris Farley and David Spade, especially together.
I know, me too! They are hilarious!
(Singing) Fat guy in a little coat, fat guy in a little coat.
(Laughing) That was one of my favorite parts of Tommy Boy!
Me too! And when Chris Farley's character broke the car door...
And tried to blame it on David Spade's character. So funny!!
Those are two movies that I never get tired of watching. They make me laugh every time!
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the movie Bad Moms?
Yes, it was hillarious! I love that Mila Kunis played the main character, Amy.
Yes, she was so funny in That 70's Show. I liked Christina Applegate the most though.
She was so funny at the end when she became friends with them!
I know, I wasn't expecting that!
I really liked the scene when they threw the party at Amy's house.
Me too. Kathryn Hahn was so funny! I couldn't stop laughing.
She says so many funny things in that movie.
Yes, she really did make the movie much funnier.
If Kathryn Hahn wasn't in the movie it wouldn't have been as good at all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Pirate Movie?
No, I have not, is it any good.
Yes, it's a Pop Culture filled slapstick and rocked up version of the musical play The Pirates of Penzance.
I've heard of that play, but how does the movie differ?
Well, it is set in then modern times, the mid80s and is about an American excahnge student named Mabel Stanley at a Pirate festival in Austrialia
Okay, what happens
Mabel meets a guy and when she tries to join him on his boat, her exchange family sisters dupe her and take off without her.
Okay, so they leave at the pier. SO then, what happens.
She tries to follow in a rented boat, but gets swamped and knocked out. She washes ashore on an island and has a comedic pirate themed dream.
Okay, sound a bit different, but I might look to see if I can find and watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie the other women?
Yes its so funny
I love it
Its funny how they all get together and end up becoming friends
It is and he has a lot of mistresses
I know he is a busy guy
Right
I love the ending
Me too, he got what he deserves
It was great
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched National Lampoon's Vacation again for the 15th time
Oh wow, that's a classic
Chevy Chase in his prime was amazing
Him and Bill Murray together , we should have had more of those movies.
Dan Akroyd was okay, but not at that level
Wasn't he in the original Ghostbusters
Ghostbusters, so sad what they did to that franchise
I know right, what were they thinking
Any good comedies coming out this year
Not that I know of
XXXXXXXXXXX
Adam Sandler is my favorite comedian. I loved him in Just Go With It.
Me too. I was surprised by how funny Nicole Kidman was in that movie.
Jennifer Aniston was pretty funny, too.
She was great in Bruce Almighty with Jim Carrey.
I wonder if Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler have ever worked on a movie together.
I don't know, but a classic Adam Sandler movie is Big Daddy.
Yeah that one is pretty funny, but I like Wedding Singer more than that one.
I forgot about that one. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler go great together.
I agree. What was that movie that came out a few years ago with both of them in it?
Oh, I know. You're thinking of Blended.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a good movie to make me laugh?
Have you seen "Clerks?" One of Kevin Smith's best movies, in my opinion.
I've actually never seen it. I loved Dogma though.
Dogma was great. George Carlin was so funny in that.
What other movies has Kevin Smith done?
He's done a lot, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
Didn't he do a movie with Jennifer Lopez?
Yes, it was Jersey Girl. Its not funny at all, so don't bother.
I guess I'll start with Clerks and go on from there.
Try to watch them in order. You can watch Kevin Smith grow as a director.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude did you see Super Troopers?
Is that the movie about the cops in New Hampshire
Yeah, its something like that - what did you think?
That Ramathorn guy was awesome, I loved his moustache
Did you see the scene where they cover the fat guy in powdered sugar?
Oh yeah, the one guy who got arrested by the other police guys?
Yeah that guy - I am really excited I heard they were making a sequel.
Really? Do you think the whole cast is coming back?
I heard they were, so it should be really good.
I hope so, some of the other movies these guys did were not so great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Half Baked is an American Classic.
I barely rememeber it.
It is worth watching again.
Ok I will do that.
It has many elements of a great film.
It is also a comedy?
Yes the comedy is especially hillarious.
I want to watch it soon.
I suggest you do, you will enjoy it.
Ok thank you for telling me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey i got a question for you
Sure you can ask me anything you need
Well what is your favorite comedy

Why is that
Their is so many that  i love
Is their?
Yeah i love many of them
Well pick one
I guess zoolander would be one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Adam Sandler movies?
Yes, pretty much all of them
I thought some were pretty silly, but there are some hidden gems
Which one is your favorite?
Happy Gilmore
Yeah, that was pretty good...Shooter McGavin
I also liked Billy Madison
Really? That one is kind of silly.
It was his first big hit
Yeah, I guess you're right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Ferrell is so unfunny.
You're crazy!
Hardly. Name one good movie he's been in.
Zoolander.
But he wasn't the star of that movie. Ben Stiller was.
That's not what you asked though.
OK. Name a movie that he was the unequivocal star.
Talledega Nights.
That movie was awful.
You just don't know good movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Dumb and Dumber?
I think it is very funny.
Jim Carrey is great in that movie.
He is so funny. I love him in Ace Ventura too.
He is one of the funniest guys ever on camera.
What is your favorite part in Dumb and Dumber?
When he fights the chef
That is great. So well done.
The Farley brothers make great comedies.
Yeah, Kingpin is awesome too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good comedy?
I like Groundhog Day.
Really? Who is in that?
Bill Murray is in it. He plays a weatherman.
That is wild. What does he do in the movie?
He is reporting on Groundhog Day and enters a sort of purgatory that he can't get out of until he fixes his life.
Wow! That sounds like something I need to experience!
Are you talking about the movie or the purgatory? The concept is so great that it makes you think like that!
I am talking about both!
Awesome. Go check this movie out now. It will change your life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of movies do you watch?
I lile to watch comedies
Me too
Have you seen The Boss?
I dont think so, who is in it?
Melissa Mcarthy
Oh i love her movies
This one was funny, you should watch it.
Ill have to look it up
Great
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least liked type of movie
Well  i am not a movie person
Why are you not a movie person
Because they do not have a long lasting affect
But they are entertaining
Well i do not like comedy movies to much
Why not
The funniness usually falls flat for me and just does nothing for me
I guess that would be personal taste
I mean everything is subjective
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Caddyshack?
I actually hadn't seen it until a few months ago.
What did you think about it?
I actually loved it.
What was your favorite part?
I mean, the most classic part had to be the candy in the pool.
Oh, yeah, that was funny.
The whole movie was funny though.
I mean how could it not be?  Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were in it.
Yeah, a true classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer musical comedies or straight comedies?
Definitely musical comedies. They're so much campier!
Agreed, like have you seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show?
Isn't that, you know, a horror film?
No, it parodies horror movies! It's so funny!
Who was in it?
Tim Curry as the lead role as the villain, and Barry Bostwick and Susan Surandon play his victims.
I'll watch anything with Susan Surandon in it.
You should check it out. The music is hilarious too.
You've sold me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Adam Sandler still make movies at all?
The last one I saw him in came out a few years ago, I think it was called Blended.
Who else was in that movie?
Drew Barrymore - she's in a lot of Adam Sandler movies.
I hadn't noticed. What other movies are they in together?
She played Julia on The Wedding Singer.
That's right! I loved that movie, especially when they're on the plane with Billy Idol.
My favorite part is where the old lady raps Rapper's Delight.
The Wedding Singer has a lot of good music in it.
It really showcases Adam Sandler's musical skills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like comedy movies a lot
It is the best genre i must say
Their is not anything i enjoy more
Maybe i should put one on
Sure go ahead
I would recommend some of the scary movies
Those are classics
I know arent they
They are pretty amazing
I hope they make a new one too
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Role Models have you seen it?
I have never saw that movie.
What about We're the Millers?
I saw that one that was pretty good.
Yes I thought was pretty funny.
Me too. I like Jennifer Aniston.
I like her also. Did you see her in Just go with it?
Yes that one is so funny. I like Adam Sandler he is funny.
He is funny. I watched him in so many movies I can't remember them all.
I know I like him also.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
I'm a fan of older comedies such as old Charlie Chaplin movies.  How about you?
I like some of the older stuff too, but one of my favorite newer comedies is "Dumb and Dumber."
Really?  That seems such an odd choice.
Yes, it does, but the sheer ridiculousness of it is genius.  Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are brilliantly stupid.
Yes, I guess they are.  What are your favorite parts?
I don't necessarily have a favorite part or theme; pretty much everything they do from the scenes in the doggy van to them riding on the moped are hilarious.
I guess my favorite scenes are when they are skiing and at the ski lodge.
And Lauren Holly is the perfect foil for Jim's and Jeff's foolish characters.
I will have to watch it again just for kicks sometime when I need a laugh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a funny movie we can watch?
How about Easy A?
Perfect. Emma Stone is so great in that movie.
I know. I love her parents in the movie too.
Right? They're like the cool, funny, parents that everyone wishes they had.
I bet that Stanley Tucci would make a really great dad.
I loved him in the Julie Julia Project, he was such a caring husband to Julia.
He's such a good actor, you feel like you're there with him.
I'm really surprised he hasn't gotten more starring roles.
Me too. I feel like he would be an excellent leading man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite comedy movie?
Without a doubt Happy Gilmore.
I agree, Adam Sandler was fantastic in the movie.
He was indeed. Many great lines and scenes
Which did you like best?
I think when Bob Barker was his playing partner in the Pro-Am
Yeah, when Barker got so mad at Happy for playing so poorly they got in a fight.
Do you remember who one the fight?
Of course, BArker faked like he was knocked out and then shocked Happy and pounded him into submission. Hilarious.
The PGA commissioner then attempted to kick Happy off the tour.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love comedy movies, what do you think of them?
I don't like them because they all seem the same nowadays.
I do think comedy movies used to better.
Yeah, now they all make the same jokes.
I really did like" Deadpool" it was very funny.
Those comedy movies are good I just don't like movies like" Neighbors".
Kill me but I actually like movies like that.
Maybe I would like them if they weren't all R-Rated
That's what makes them funny!
Makes them stupid if you ask me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am thinking going next door
What do you want to get
I think their is a store open still their
Yeah
I want to go to the redbox and rent  a comedy
Well that would a fun night
Yeah you got any movies to advise me to watch
How about super bad
i actually might see
It is funny it has jonah hill in it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Kung Fu Hustle?
Is that like a Bruce Lee movie?
No, it's more of a comedy than a martial arts movie.
I'm not sure if I've seen it.
It's kind of a parody of Kung Fu type movies.
Oh, yeah, I think I've seen it.
Yeah, it's a few years old.
I want to say it came out like ten years ago.
Yeah, that sounds about right.
Yeah, I've seen it once or twice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy t.v. show?
Mine is definitely Eastbound and Down.
I've never heard of that. Is it new?
No, actually it came out a while ago. Its an HBO exclusive series.
Interesting, what is it about?
It's about a guy who was a pro baseball player but he loses his talent and becomes a teacher.
That actually sounds hilarious. Who is the main character played by?
Danny Mcbride. Hes the guy who plays 'Red', the drug dealer in Pineapple Express.
Isn't he in a lot of movies with Seth rogan?
Yes, he is in most of Seth Rogans movies, along with James Franco.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so what did you do last night?
Watched The Big Lebowski.
Really? Again? That's like the millionth time you've watched that movie!
What can I saw? I can't get enough of John Goodman.
Yeah, he's pretty awesome, in just about everything he's in.
Yeah, plus Jeff Bridges. Mr. Tron himself.
Tron?
Oh come on, you haven't seen Tron? That's an 80s classic?
Well, I was thinking Steve Buscemi when you mentioned The Big Lebowski.
Oh man, Buscemi is great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am liking these new movies
Oh yeah
The new disney movies have some good comedy
Do they?
They are absolutely hilarious and funny
I have not watched a disney movie for a few years
Well you should watch some then
Can i go with you next time
Sure i am never  to busy
Cool i hope the comedy is as funny as you say
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's a great comedy?  Bridesmaids.
Yes, it was terrific.  A wonderful cast.
I don't usually like that type of comedy.  But, this one just has the right cast to make it enjoyable.
Yes, Melissa McCarthy made her mark in this one!!
Yes, she is willing to take things to the edge.
Melissa is someone that you would watch in almost any movie.
I've seen Kristen in several movies.  She does have a certain sensitivity.
I also enjoy Kristen Wiig.  She is poignant as well as funny.
I also thought Maya Rudolph was very good.
I think she is underrated at times. She can play so many different characters and styles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dumb and dumber was so funny.
Really? I don't think so.
It's a classic!
Jim Carrey is just goofy. And that movie was pretty dumb.
That's the whole point! They were supposed to be dumb.
I get that, but still don't like it.
That movie had so many great quotes though.
Big gulps, at?  All right then, see you later.
Exactly ask! You do like it.
Nope, I'm just really smart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy older comedy movies?
Yes, I do very much.
Well then, which one stands out to you the most?
Probably Caddyshack. I thought it was great.
Isn't Chevy Chase in that movie?
Yes! He is hilarious in it!
Haha, I know. I love him in National Lampoons Vegas Vacation.
He is funny in all those Vacation movies.
Hell yeah he is. Have you seen Christmas Vacation?
No, but I heard it was really funny. I'm actually probably going to watch it soon now that you mentioned it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Fargo?
No. What is that?
It is a comedy, but it is a black comedy.
Black comedy movies are great. They really make you think.
They do. The Coen Brothers directed it.
Wow! They made so many great movies!
They do. Some of their usual actors are in it too.
Awesome! So why is it a dark comedy?
It is funny, but there are murders that happen in it.
That is scary. I will have to check this out though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I figured for our Saturday movie marathon we'd watch some Mel Brooks comedys.
Awesome, I assume Spaceballs is one of them
Of course, spaceballs the lunch box, space balls the flame thrower.
One of the best lines of the movie.  I heard they are in talks for an actual spaceballs 2.
No way.  Rick Moranis is actually coming out of retirement for it.
So I hear.  Can't have Spaceballs with out him as Lord Helmet.
No you can't.  I also picked Young Frankenstien
Another of my favorites.  Gene Wilder is the best.
I know, so sad he passed away.
Yeah, but the best way to honor him is to keep watching his movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you tell me a good comedy movie?
Yeah, Gone Fishin'
Who is in that?
Joe Pesci and Danny Glover.
Wow, those are two great actors.
Yeah, I agree.
What other movie do you recommend?
Celtic Pride.
Who's in that one?
Daniel Stern and Dan Aykroyd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder who came up with the idea for a comedy movie
What do you mean
like who thought of making a movie funny
Well comedy has been around since he days of plays
Has it?
Yes since the plays of shakesphere had some humor in it
I guess you could be right
I am rights
Well then show me some facts
Just google it man
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
I would have to say the Kevin Hart stand up movies.
Why do you like these?
The level of entertainment on these movies are amazing.
Which one do you like the most?
'What Now?' was my favorite.
His personality was on full display on this one, it was awesome.
I agree, I could not stop laughing the entire time.
He is a very funny as successful action.
Yes, he has been amazing for years. Great comedian.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Barbershop is one of my favorite comedy movies
That one is so funny.
I love cedric the entertainer in it.
Me too, hes a great actor and really funny
Its a great movie in general
I love the stm heist
Me too

XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the movie Big?
The one with Tom Hanks?
Yeah, did you see it?
Oh, I used to watch that all the time.
I loved that movie!
What was your favorite part?
I liked the whole part of the kid being an adult and doing what he wanted.
Any parts in particular?
I liked when the girl was hitting on him and he invited her to a slumber party.
Oh, that was memorable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, glad I caught you! I heard there are going to be some Marx Brothers movies on tonight. They're hilarious!
I really don't like the Marx Brothers.
What do you mean  you don't like the Marx Brothers? Everybody likes the Marx Brothers!
I guess I'm the exception that proves the rule!
What don't you like about them?
I just don't really care for all that slapstick comedy. Not my thing.
But they're so funny when they do stuff like that!
I know lots of people like physical comedy, but I don't.
Well, I love that kind of stuff, pies in the face and all that.
Then I'm sure you're going to enjoy the movies tonight. Have fun!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to seeing Rough Night?
I don't know.  What do you think?
I think it looks funnier than Bridesmaids.
I agree that Bridesmaids was disappointing.
I don't know about Scarlett Johanson being funny but the plot looks good.
I think she can pull it off.
I hope it's like another Hangover.
Hangover 1, that it, not 2 or 3.
Hangover 2 was just dark.
And 3 was boring.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good comedy movie to watch?
I just watched Stripes the other day. I love that movie.
Who is in that? I've never seen it.
It stars Bill Murray and John Candy, and they join the army together.
I love Bill Murray! He's hilarious.
Me too. I think you'd really like Stripes, its one of his earlier movies.
I just watched him in Dumb and Dumber To.
I wasn't really a fan of that one at all. I feel like they should have left it at the one.
What about The Grand Budapest Hotel? Did you like that?
That I did like a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Speaking of Mel Brooks, did you ever see Spaceballs?
Yeah. I saw it.  I didn't know he directed that one.
I think it's his last funny movie, to be honest.
What did he make after that?
Life Stinks, about a guy who becomes homeless, and then Robin Hood: Men in Tights.
You didn't like Men in Tights?
I thought it stunk!  I couldn't even finish it the first time.
I thought it was hilarious!  All the guys in the musical number?
I wanted to like it but it was just so dull.
You don't know what you're missing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You fan of Old School?
Yes, that was a great movie. Probably one of the greatest comedies of our time
Yeah, it was pretty good. I liked Will Ferrell's character.
Yes, he definitely stole the show.
I liked Luke Wilson's work in it as well
He was kind of bland in my opinion
I liked how he played a straight face for so much of it.
Yeah, but Vince Vaughn was better in his role
I agree, he was pretty good as well.
Oh and don't forget Snoop Dog!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you say is your favorite comedy?
I loved the movie Daddy's Home.
Doesn't that have Will Ferrell in it?
Yes it does and Mark Wahlberg.
I need to watch that soon, haven't seen it.
I bet you would really like it if you enjoy comedies.
Have you seen the new movie Fist Fight?
Yes actually I have, that has Ice Cube in it right?
Yes he is hilarious!
I really do too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that new comedy Fist Fight?
No, I haven't got a chance yet.  Who is in that?
Its got Charlie Day and Ice Cube.
Oh yeah,  I saw the trailers for that.  Looked pretty funny.
It was ok, not the funniest thing ever.
A lot of comedies coming out now seem kind of stupid.
The last one I really laughed at in the theater was The Heat.
That's the one with Sandra Bullock?
Yeah, her and Melissa McCarthy.
She has gone downhill though.  A lot of her movies aren't funny anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there

Yes there is. Please do not watch it around children !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie The Wedding Singer?
Yes, I loved it! Adam Sandler did a really good job.
Yes he did, I also liked Drew Barrymore in that movie.
She did a good job, better than in 50 First Dates.
Yes, I wasn't a huge fan of that movie. I did like Adam Sandler in Mr. Deeds.
He was pretty funny in that movie. His character kind of reminded me of his character in Happy Gilmore.
Oh yes, that's the movie where he is a hockey player and enters a golf tournament right?
Yes, his being really strong is what reminds me of his character in Mr. Deeds.
Oh you're right. That's also true in the movie Waterboy.
Yes it is! That's one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy comedy movies?
Very much so, in the right circumstances.
What are some comedies that you like the most?
I think some older comedies, such as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Wayne's World are quite enjoyable.
You say Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.  Is that because you like Adam Sandler?
Yes, I like Adam Sandler, but I mostly just like the style of comedy involved in those specific movies.
What style is it that you're referring to?
I like a style of comedy that is contemporary and raunchy.
Raunchy?  What do you mean by that?
I mean comedies that are explicit in some way or crossing the lines of what is considered politically correct.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Friday After Next?
Yes I have, what about it?
Who was your favorite in that movie?
I would have to say Katt Williams he was MOney Mike.

Really, wow that's alot.
I like all the Fridays as well there hilarious.
Thanks maybe we can watch some together soon
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last comedy you saw?
I'm really more into 80s comedies, so I just rewatched Big.
I love that movie! Tom Hanks was hilarious in it.
I know, he did such a good job acting like an overgrown kid.
But then again, Tom Hanks is great in anything.
He was also really good in that other movie Sleepless in Seattle.
I personally thought he was best in A League of Their Own.
That movie had such a great cast!
I know, Geena Davis and Rosie and Madonna did a really good job.
Now I want to re-watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any good comedy movies recently?
No I have not.
I suggest you watch my favorite movie.
What movie is that?

Ok I will.
There is a lot going on in that movie.

Do you remember Napoleon Dynomite?
Oh, I remember when that came out.
Yeah, it was hilarious.
Well, it was a different kind of humor.

Yeah, and trying to do that dance.
What was your favorite part?
I thought it was funny when he was yelling at the llama.

"Turn it off, man! Turn it off!"
Oh yeah, the scene where that guy is trying to use that awful haircutting machine on Garth. That was hilarious!
What's your favorite scene?

Yeah, that was horrible.
Who was the actress in it again?
I think Cameron Diaz.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was it.

Eddie Murphy is a prince from Africa. His father the king wants him to marry someone he doesn't love.
Someone from America? Is that what the title means?
No, he comes to America to find a woman he does want to marry.
Oh, that sounds cool! What character does Arsenio Hall play?
He plays a servant that goes with Eddie Murphy's character on his journey to America.
I bet they're really funny together!

One of my favorite comedies was this outrageous puppet movie called Team America : World Police. It was a scream.
Yes, I saw that one and loved it too. I remember watching the puppet TV shows decades ago - Thunderbirds, I lived for that one.
Team America was such a perfect copy of the marionettes in Thunderbirds, and at the same time, a total sendup that was fearless in its comedy.
I got a kick out of the goofiness of marionette movement and the lip moves and stuff - that was a constant funny throughout the whole thing.
Yes, and the sendup of the despot Kim Jong Il in his underwater lair like some Bond villain, was just falling down funny.
Totally. I remember him singing "I'm Lonely ("Wone-wee" in that hilariously awful Engrish) as one of his dispatched political victims floated in the water outside the window.
The tasteless stuff was the funniest stuff, honestly. Remember the puppet sex scene in the "unrated" version?
Funny enough that a puppet movie could be forced to cut certain scenes for sexual content, just let that sink in for a moment. But they were so funny, I can't imagine watching the tamer version
Yeah, if you're gonna go for it, jump in with both feet, right?
Thunderbirds must have been rolling in its grave, but Team America is a really funny movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a good comedy we can watch?
Have you seen "Planes, Trains & Automobiles ?"
With Steve Martin? Yes, I love that movie.
Its totally a classic, one of my all time favorite Steve Martin movies.
I really liked him in "Roxanne."
That was a good movie too.
I know, we can watch "The Three Amigos!"
I wasn't really a fan of that one.
Seriously? That's one of my favorite movies ever.
Why don't we just watch "Planes, Trains, and Automobiles?"
XXXXXXXXXXX

I watched an Adam Sandler movie on netflix not to long ago.
Oh which one?
The waterboy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
Any movie with Adam Sandler. He's hilarious!
He is great! I loved him in Billy Madison!
That movie is hilarious! Have you seen Grown Ups?
I have seen the first one, how is the second?
It's the BEST! Kevin James and David Spade are hilarious, too.
Grown Ups 1 was funny. Chris Rock cracks me up.
I like the burp snart's that Kevin James does.
Haha yes. Totally funny.
Have you seen Mall Cop with Kevin James?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite comedy movie?
Theres so many, probably identity theif
That was good, i prefer The Heat
That one was good too, i love melissa mccarthy and sandra bullock together
It was a great dynamic
It was
I love all melissa mccarthy movies
She is one of the funniest actors
I agree, and most of the funny is the way she swears constantly
Thats true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the American Pie movies?
I saw the first two.
Did you like them?
I liked the first one.  The second was okay.
I loved all of them.
I don't know, the humor got old after a while.
How could it get old?
I mean, it was funny when it came out because I was a teenager.  After a while, it was lame.
I guess I never grew up.
And some of us do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy right now?
The answer will surprise you, are you ready?
Yes, just tell me.
I really like 'The boss baby'
Really, you liked that childrens movie?
Trust me, if you go see it you will like it a lot.
I will look at the trailer online and make my decision from there.
You will not be disappointed, it was simply amazing
Which comedy will you watch next?
Rough Night is the movie that I will see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the latest Dumb and Dumber?
Total waste.
Yeah, wish I had known.
They should have let the original stand.
You know studios can't help themselves.
Jim Carrey should have known better.
True, but what has he got going on these days.
Fair enough.
The first one was so good. How could a sequel stack up.
You speak the truth!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite kinds of movies are comedies.
What's your favorite?
I really like Judd Apatow movies like This is 40.
Did you know that Leslie Mann is actually his wife in real life?
No, I didn't!
Yes, and the two girls in his movies are actually their daughters, Iris and Maude Apatow.
I also really like Adam Sandler movies.
I think he's hilarious! I love Big Daddy.
Big Daddy was good, but my favorite is 50 First Dates.
Is that the one where Drew Barrymore plays a woman with amnesia?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Jim carrey comedy film?
I would say the mask or ace ventura.. you?
For me is is dumb and dumber. I think it is one of the greatest comedies out there.
I did enjoy jim carrey in this film a swell. all of them show off his particular style so well.
He does have a very distinct type of humor performance. I think it is what makes him popular.
You can't just plug in any actor, it has to be jim.
Very true, none of these films would be what they are without him. his facial expressions and delivery are so unique.
You know more or less what to expect when you go see a jim carrey film at least a comedy.
Man on the moon was a different style for him, but still very character driven.
Yes the character role itself had a lot of quirks of his own similar to carrey on some levels but oh so different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey! We saw a pretty funny comedy on Saturday.
Cool - what was it?
It was called Masterminds.
And it was good?
Honestly, I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised.
Who's in it?
I should have known it would be good when I saw the main actors: Kristen Wiig, Zach Galifianakis, Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis.
Wow! Nice line up!
Was it better than Keeping Up With the Joneses?
Yeah, a lot better - it was goofier and the actors could really shine. Kristen Wiig was hilarious, and Zach Galifianakis, of course, was really really funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Seen any good comedy movies lately?
I saw step brothers not too long ago.
For the first time?
Yeah.
Man I love that movie.
Yeah it was great.
Will Ferrel kills me in that.
He was so funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Goon?
No, never heard of it.
It's about a hockey player paid to fight.
Who's in it?
Sean William Scott is the goon.
He is hilarious
Yes, he is tough too.
I remember him in American Pie.
That's him. He plays Doug the Thug in this one.
I should watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like 'Airplane'?
That's my favorite comedy movie! It's so stupid.
I know, I love it. Just the simplest jokes but they work so well.
That type of stupid humor is the best. Do you like 'Groundhog Day'?
Who doesn't?! It's a classic and Bill Murray is funny in everything.
'What About Bob' is another great one with Bill Murray, but lesser known.
I don't think I've heard of that, I'll have to see it.
It has Richard Dreyfuss in it too - it's so cringey and awkward.
Bill Murray always does awkward humor better than anyone.
Oh yeah, he's one of the all time great comic actors.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like comedy movies?
I like some. Do you?
I like anything with Will Farrell in it.
Yes, Step Brothers is hilarious.
John C. Reilly is a great comedy actor as well.
I really liked Bridesmaids too.
Melissa McCartney was funny in that.
Yes, but I haven't liked her in anything since.
Is comedy your favorite genre?
Yes, I think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy film?
My favorite has always been Billy Madison.
What a great movie with so many good one-liners!
I agree; it's just so quotable!
What about Billy Madison?
I love that one too, though I get annoyed by how immature Adam Sandler's character is in the film.
Yeah, that's true, but Chris Farley's cameo is amazing.
Oh, I know! He's amazing.
I just wish Adam Sandler would make good comedies again.
Agreed, or quit trying to make comedies altogether.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like comedy?
Yes comedies are my favorite
Did you watch the hangover movies
Yes those are so stuoid and so funny.
Its just like a series of unfortunate events happen to them
The funniest part was when they found the baby
I love all the work they go through to try and figure out what happened
Didnt they lose one of the guys once
Yes i think he was kidnapped by a drug dealer or something
They are so funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Liar Liar?
I like that one.
Yes Jim Carrey is always funny.
I like when he beat himself up in the bathroom.
Me too that was funny.
Do you see him in The Cable Guy?
Yes that was funny too.
He was something in that one.
Yes he latched on and wouldn't let go.
Yes wow the guy couldn't get rid of him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like dark comedies or more lighthearted comedies?
Honestly, I like both. My favorite comedy though is Zoolander.
Is that the one with Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller?
Yeah, they're male models and it's hilarious.
"Hansel. He's so hot right now"
Haha yeah, Will Ferrell's character is great. "I invented the piano key necktie!"
It's a really great movie to quote. So many good ones.
"I think I'm catching the black lung pop. It's not very well ventilated down there."
Isn't the woman in Zoolander also Ben Stiller's wife in real life?
I've heard that, but I'm not 100% sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite comedic actor?
I would have to say that Jim Carey is on the top of my list.
Yes, I think that Ace Ventura was a very funny movie.
I also really liked Chris Farley as an actor when he was alive.
Tommy Boy was a very funny film.
I also think as far as comedy in the nineties Wayne's World was up there.
Yes that movie made me love Bohemian Rhapsody.
I heard the actors had a headache after all the head banging.
The funniest part was the flashbacks.
Yes I loved the way they wiggled their hands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Stepbrothers?
Yes I love that movie. Could watch it 100 times.
What is funny is there is some people that age still at home.
That is true. Will Ferrell is always funny.
Did you like him in Anchorman?
Yes he was funny with Christina Applegate.
Yes they were good together.
I saw two Anchorman's did they make more then that?
No I think they only made two.
Ok good cause I didn't want to miss any. I like them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hello.
What is the best comedy of all time that you've ever seen.
I like a lot of older stuff.
Like how far back?
Well not like charlie chaplin, even though I love him.
Then like what?
Like Blazzing Saddles.
Oh so Mel Brooks type stuff.
Yeah absolutely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite kind of comedy movie?
I love screwball comedies!
What in the world is that?
It's something they called movies from the thirties and forties that had to do with really funny situations at a fast pace.
Oh, I think I understand.
Let me give you an example.
Ok, what movie is a good example.
A movie called The Awful Truth is a great one.
Who comes out in that?
It stars Cary Grant and Irene Dunne as a divorcing couple and all the funny situations they find themselves in. You'd love it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are they ever going to make another Austin Powers movie?
I think they were planning to at one time.
Seems kind of pointless though.
Yeah, those movies have come and gone.
Mike Myers hasn't done jack in how many years now?
Well, pretty much since Austin Powers.
If they did do one, he'd be another 20 years old or so I think.
I'd rather him make another Wayne's World before this.
Totally agree with you.  Party on, Wayne!
Party on, Garth!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Tina Fey movie?
I think it would have to be Mean Girls. What about you?
Mean Girls is a good one, but Sisters is probably my favorite.
Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are great together. They look like they could be sisters in real life!
I know. They were also hilarious in Baby Mama together.
Oh yeah, that was a good one too.
Wow I just realized they were in Mean Girls together, too! I completely forgot that Amy Poehler played Regina George's mom.
I completely forgot too! It's so funny when she says that she's a cool mom, not a regular mom.
I know, and the fact that her boobs are rock hard.
Yeah, that movie is classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you seen the moive Mafia!?
No, what's it about, some real early gangster fillm?
No, it a comedic spoof of gangster movies and it was Llyod Bridges's last film.
Llyod Bridges? Then it was be pretty funny.
Yeah, they spoof the Godfather and the movie Casino.
Okay, how are the jokes and gags?
Well, the Don( Lylod Bridges character) is shot 47 times at his daughter's wedding by a giant disguised as a priest, who say's" Say hello to my little friend:, lift's his cassock and a midget with a machinegun steps out.
Okay, nice Scarface reference, anything else?
Anthony "Tony" Cortino, played by Jay Mohr, the Don's youngest son is blow up by a car bomb and returns disfigured in a parody of "The English Patient"
Okay, this sounds worth a look.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite comedy actor?
I love Paul Rudd.
I completely agree. I've been a fan of him since Wet Hot American Summer.
He's handsome, and he's so sarcastically funny.
He can even turn a superhero movie into a comedy. Just look at Ant-Man.
Yeah, I feel like he's never been in any very bad movies.
My favorite movie of his has to be 40 Year-Old Virgin.
He definitely steals some scenes in that film.
What is your favorite comedy with Paul Rudd?
I'd have to say Knocked Up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Ghostbusters?
Yeah, with Bill Murray. I love that movie.
I love all the actors in that movie.
Like Dan Akroid? He was too funny.
I like the part when Dan Akroid gets slimed by the fat ghost in the hallway.
I like that little funny guy who says he is the key master or the gatekeeper or whatever.
That dudes hilarious, how he thinks his apartment door is locked because hes pulling instead of pushing it.
And the ending is funny with the huge statepuff marshmellow man.
When they were facing that demon on top of the building?
Yep, and they had to fight the first thing they could think of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like funny movies?
Oh yea, my favorite is Bridesmaids with Melissa McCarthy. She is hilarious.
I know, she cracks me up. My favorite part of that movie was where Lillian crapped in the street.
HAHA, yes! Maya Rudolph nailed it. Did you know that was her husband in real life who plays the air marshall.
Wow that is awesome. I couldnt work with my husband.
Oh girl me either, but if he were funny like the air marshall, or if Wilson Phillips were part of it I probably could.
Right? The end there was great too, where they all did the dance.
Oh yes, and the take one with the sandwich and video camera. I really could watch this movie over and over.
Me too. And if i could go by the cops and not get pulled over, while "look no one is driving" or littering, wouldnt it be great?
Yes it would, unfortunatley we arent rich and famous!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How was your weekend?  Did you do anything interesting.
Since it rained all weekend, I bought myself a bottle of wine a watched a romantic comedy movie marathon.
Sounds fun.  What did you watch?
I watched Bridget Jones Diary, Four Weddings and a Funeral, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Love Actually.
I love romantic comedies from the 1990's - especially British RomComss.  Hugh Grant is great.
I think that I can basically quote Four Weddings and a Funeral line by line.  You should also watch About a Boy if you have not seen it.
LOL.  About a Boy is actually in my queue for the next rainy day.  Do you have any other suggestions?
If it does not need to be a British film, I would recommend Dogma and, my all time favorite - The Princess Bride.
Both of those are great!  I love Dogma.  Princess Bride is a classic!  "My name is Inigo Montoya!  You killed my father!  Prepare to Die!
LOL.  Makes me laugh just thinking about.  I cant believe that movie is about 30 years old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any good comedies lately?
Yeah. I finally got around to seeing Knocked Up.
I've never heard of that one. Who's in it?
The main characters are played by Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl.
Oh. Seth Rogen is the guy that played in Pineapple Express, right?
That's right. He's pretty funny.
He's been in quite a few movies with James Franco.
I think the best one they starred in together was This Is the End where they basically parodied themselves.
That one was so funny. It was cool to see all the cameos in that movie.
I know. I thought it was hilarious when Rihanna slapped Michael Cera across the face after he touched her butt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen a movie that made you laugh out loud?
A few. One was that Seth McFarlane one about the west.
That one was hilarious.
There are some decent Adam Sandler ones too.
That's true. Blended was funny.
I didn't like the Water Boy, though, because he was weird in it.
I agree. He was obnoxious in it.
Have you seen any other good ones with him?
Little Nicky was kind of funny.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Me, Myself and Irene again.
That movie cracked me up!
One of Jim Carrey's best!
If not THE best!
What was your favorite scene?
Them trying to put down the cow!
You sadist!
But the cow still lived.
"Let go 'ol girl"
To friggin ridiculous!
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite Will Ferrell movies is Elf.
I love that movie! I could watch it over and over again.
Me too! And as a matter of fact I have.
He is so funny! His facial expressions and the way he acts as Buddy the Elf.
I love the shower scene myself when he was singing.
That was good, but so was the part when he called the midget angry in the board meeting.
Yes that was hysterical.
That is my favorite Christmas movie.
Mine too. I start watching it right after Thanksgiving.
I do too. Will Ferrell is really funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like for a comedy actor?
I love robin williams
Me too, its such a shame he died
I know, i was hoping he would make more movies
I love mrs doubtfire
Thats a good one, i like jack because i love kids
I never actually saw that one
You need to,  its a great movie
I will have to look it up
You wont regret it
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I watched "21 Jump Street" last night.
The new one? With Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill?
The very same. I thought it was hysterical.
It was really good, I love Jonah Hill, he cracks me up.
Me too! He was hilarious in Grandma's Boys!
Oh yeah, I remember that! My favorite Jonah movie though was "Get Him To The Greek."
I really liked that too. My favorite scene is when they take the "Jeffrey" and he goes totally crazy.
Yes! And P Diddy starts chasing him and Russel Brand through the hotel.
I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.
I really wish P Diddy would do more comedy acting, he's really good too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Jerk?
Who was in that?
It was with Steve Martin.
So it's an older movie?
Yeah, it was from the 80's.
I never heard of it.  What's it about?
Steve Martin is adopted by this black family and grows up thinking he is black.  Then he goes off on his own into the city.
I don't see how that would make a good movie.
Well, he led a sheltered life and has a good heart, so he trusts everyone.  And he has a skewed view of the real world.
It sound kind of interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've never understood if Forrest Gump is a comedy or drama.
Both.
How do you figure?
Well, it has many comedic elements, mostly Forrest himself.
But it's also got a lot of serious parts.
I get that, but let me ask you this: how often did you laugh during the movie?
Quite a bit.
Well, there's your answer.  It's part-comedy.
I guess. It still feels weird.
Trust me on this one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
It changes a lot with me.
So what is your favorite right now?
I just saw Lego Batman it was hilarious.
I loved how the gave Batman a goofy personality.
I wouldn't saw he was goofy, he was just more relaxed.
What was your favorite scene?
It was the scene where he said, "life doesn't give you seatbelts'.
I thought that was funny.
The whole movie was funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen 'The Hangover' movies?
Only the first one, which I thought was pretty good. Not the others, though.
I've seen all 3 and I agree, I think the first one is my favorite.
So you wouldn't recommend the other two?
Not really - if you've seen the first one that's kind of all you need. Zach Galifanakis is just so funny.
He was the main reason I watched the first one, actually.
I'm glad he's getting a lot more movie roles. I always loved his stand up comedy.
Me too, and he somehow brings that weird sense of humor to mainstream movies.
He's one of the few actors where I know I'll laugh, so I'll see a movie just because he's in it.
Same here - him and Will Ferrell are guaranteed to make a movie funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like comedy movies?
Of course!
Have you ever seen Spaceballs?
No, why?
Well it's an old movie but one of my favorite comedies.  It's a Mel Brooks movie.
Oh, I love Mel Brooks.  History of the World Part I was hilarious.
Yeah, he definitely makes great movies.  But Rick Moranis in Spaceballs was hysterical.
Well, if it's by Mel Brooks, it has to be good!
It's worth it, I promise!
I'll check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Adam Sandler movies?
Yeah he's pretty funny.
What's your favorite movie?
I like Happy Gilmore.
Is that the movie about golf?
Yeah, he's a hockey player that tries golf.
Oh, I remember that movie. He hits the ball like a hockey puck.
I know it's a pretty funny movie.
It came out a while ago.
I think it came out 20 years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Woody Allen comedy?
That's a tough one. "Play It Again, Sam," I guess.
I liked that, too. But my favorite is "Annie Hall."
Why "Annie Hall"?
I think it's a really good story, with some serious elements, but also with a lot of comedy.
The part I remember best is when they tried to cook the lobsters.
Yes, that was good. I liked when they were standing in line at the movies and Woody's character was rolling his eyes at some of the pretentious moviegoers.
Oh, and then he pulled in Marshall McLuhan to set them straight?
Yes. Very funny. I also like his old school comedies, like "Bananas".
That was with the actress from "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Adam Sandler movie?
Oh geez.  Do I have to name one?
There's got to be one you don't think is that bad.
I guess I'd say Happy Gilmore.
I was thinking the same thing.  That or Billy Madison.
Both are good bets.  He hasn't made a good movie forever.
Little Nicky, Waterboy, what stinkers.
And you didn't even mention Big Daddy or Grown Ups.
Too many bad movies to count.
Guess that's why he's on Netflix only right now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Hangover? It was one of my all-time favorite movies!
Yes, I loved that movie so much! My favorite character was Zach Galifianakis.
Me too. He made the movie so much better how he always acts so innocent and unaware.
Remember that part when he put drugs in their drinks and didn't tell them?
How could I forget! That's how all the action started! What about the part when they go to Mike Tyson's house?
And they stole his tiger! That was classic comedy.
Bradley Cooper played a great lead character in this movie.
Did you see him in The Hangover Part 2?
Of course. It was just as funny as the first one.
I liked when Ed Helms got the tattoos on his face that Mike Tyson has!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Bridesmaids?
I have, so funny!
Maya Rudolph is a genius.
That scene where she is running across the street and then just squats down killed me.
Melissa McCarthy looks so different now.
I know. "Look away!!!!"
She totally stole that movie from Kristin Wiig. She was good in Tammy, too.
Yeah but Wiig got to film a bedroom scene with Jon Hamm
True, he's a stone cold fox.
He has great comedic chops.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is that actor i see that looks like donald trump you know that old guy who was on that investment tv show
Who
He is in a lot of movies with ben stiller
Comedy movies
Yeah he is blonde
You mean owen wilson?
Yeah him
He looks nothing like him...
I saw a picture and he did
You gotta show it to me
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
I love Grandma's boy!
Didn't Adam Sandler put that one on?
Yeah, he did.
I loved Happy Gilmore.
That's a classic for sure.
I once got to meet Shooter McGavin.
Really? Was he nice?
Yes, he was so sweet.
That's so awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the comedy movie Baywatch?
I'm not sure, I have not seen it.
Do you plan on seeing it?
Maybe, how was it?
It was awesome, the Rock is a great actor.
I know he is, I really enjoy his movies.
When do you plan on going to see it?
Maybe this weekend since you like it that much.
You really should, it was amazing.
Thanks for the advice, I will go see it soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
What was the last comedy you saw?
I watched Neighbors 2 not too long ago.
Did you see that in theaters?
Yeah.
What did you think?
Honestly, I didn't like it.
Not as good as the first one?
Yeah it wasn't very good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to laugh, what's a good comedy movie?
How about Bruce Almighty?
I haven't seen that, what's that about?
It stars Jim Carrey and he trades places with God.
I love Jim Carrey. I think he's the funniest man ever.
If you like Bruce Almighty, then you'll have to watch Evan Almighty.
Does Evan become God?
No, actually Evan becomes Noah.
Noah? Like with the Ark?
The very same. Both of them are great movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Anger Management?
That's the movie with Adam Sandler right?
Yeah! Jack Nicholson is in it too.
I love both of those actors.
Did you see The Shining?
Yeah, that movie really freaked me out.
It was a really crazy movie.
Whats your favorite line from that movie?
My favorite line is, Here's Johnny!
Haha, I remember that part. Jack Nicholson says it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see Happy Gilmore?
I babysat some kids in the late 90s that would watch that everyday.
So you are familiar with it?
Yeah, pretty much.  I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me.
What did you like about it?
The whole thing ended up being pretty decent, but I liked when Adam Sandler got in the fight with Bob Barker.
Yeah!  Didn't he tell him the price was wrong or something?
Yeah, something like that and started punching him.
I don't know why Bob Barker would agree to that.
I don't either but it was funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Spinal Tap?
Is that the movie with the European band?
Yeah, its a really funny movie about a band named Spinal Tap.
Yeah, I saw that one a long time ago.
Whats your favorite part in that movie?
I love the part where they say their speakers are louder because they go up to 11.
That movie is famous for that part, haha.
Yeah, it really is. I like how the band members are total idiots.
Its so funny how they run a band but none of them know whats going on.
It really seems like they have taken too many drugs or something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best Monty Python movie?
Probably Life of Brian.
I would disagree. That movie that was had some slow spots.
But it had such a classic scenes!
I think the Holy Grail would be my choice.
I totally forgot about that one
She turned me into a Newt!
A Newt?
I got better.
OK, you win. Holy Grail was the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Bridesmaids?
No, I haven't. Who is in that film?
Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy are both in it.
Oh yeah! I know Kristen Wiig from Saturday Night Live.
And Melissa McCarthy is in Ghostbusters, which just came out this year.
I haven't seen that yet, but I definitely want to! We should go!
Absolutely. Another one that just came out is Rough Night.
Isn't that with Scarlett Johansson?
Yeah! And Ilana Glazer, and Kate McKinnon.
They're all funny! Kate McKinnon was great in Office Christmas Party.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy?
There are too many to name.
Pick one you cannot live without.
Zoolander.
Is that with Ben Stiller?
Yes and Owen Wilson is in it too.
I have seen that one. It's very funny.
Did you know Will Ferrell is in it?
Really?
Yeah, he plays Mugatu.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that they're coming out with a Daddy's Home 2?
Yeah I did actually. I can't believe it.
Me either. The first one wasn't that good.
It was okay, but sequel worthy? Not sure about that.
Both Ferrell and Wahlberg were better in The Other Guys.
Absolutely. That movie was a gem.
That office pop scene was hilarious.
I know. There's so many good scenes in that film.
We should watch it again soon.
I'm down when you are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Daddy's Home?
Yea, that movie was hilarious!
Yea it was, Will Ferrell is a genius.
He sure is, and Mark Wahlberg was funny too!
Yea, he's always great.
Watching them fight over that little boy was so funny.
Yea, that scene where he teaches the kid to fight was classic.
The dance battle at the end was the best!
I really hope they do a sequel.
Me too, the way they ended it made it a possibility.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you want to come watch The Hangover?
That sounds like a good idea. I love those movies.
So do I. I can't believe they managed to make all of them so funny!
I know, I thought they would jump the shark with the third one, but they held strong.
Ed Helms kills me in those movies, he's such a great actor.
I really like how his character progresses throughout all three movies.
Yeah, he's like a whole new person by the end.
I loved him in We're the Millers, he was a maniac in that movie.
That movie was all around awesome. That cast was a complete slam dunk.
You're totally right on that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Spy yet?
I have and it is so funny. It is one of the best movies that came out recently.
Who plays in it?
Melissa McCartney, Jude Law, and also Jason Statham got to play his first comedy in a while.
I never got to see it when it came out a couple years ago, but I will stream it on Netflix.
That sounds fun. Do you want me to come over and watch it with you?
Yes that would be great.
Do you need me to bring anything?
Please bring some popcorn . and I will make lunch for us.
Ok see you then!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the second zoolander movie
I did not know their was a second
Yeah a couple years ago it came out
Wonder why they brought it back
I am not sure to be honest
Was it bad
Bad is an understatement
Shame ben stiller is one of the better comedians
Yeah they kinda tarnished it
Well maybe  i should see for myself
XXXXXXXXXXX
Thinking about all the great comedy movies.
I absolutely love Airplane.
That was a real classic.  "Don't call me Shirley!"
Yes the whole movie had great set ups and punch lines.
I love Robert Hays.  So funny playing the straight man.
Yes and Julie Hagerty also was terrific in that movie.
I never stop laughing when I watch it.
I love the part when everyone takes a turn slapping the passenger.
Yes, and Lloyd Bridges as the airplane controller.
He was hilarious in that role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am in a depressed mood at the moment.
I know what could help.
What is that?
A funny movie of course!
You may be right about that. Any suggestions?
How about Black Sheep?
That one is old though, right?
It is, but it is still awesome !
Who plays in that one anyways?
Cris Farley and David Spade.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Blast from the Past?
Not for a long time.
Was it any good?
Yeah, it's worth a watch.
My buddy has been trying to get me to watch it.
What's the hold up?
Not so big on Brenden.
Christopher Walken alone makes it worth your while.
I didn't know he was in it!
Yeah, he's pretty awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last comedy movie you saw?
I saw Central Intelligence recently.
Is that the one with Dwayne and Kevin?
Yeah, and The Rock is super crazy in it.
He's a huge child that just destroys people.
The best thing was when they were in the bar and that guy joked about his unicorn shirt.
I almost lost control of my bladder at that part.
He didn't even break a sweat with those guys, then they just walk out.
Kevin's face was priceless watching him throw guys around.
Kevin's face is usually priceless, he has great reaction faces.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the name of the that movie you watched
What movie
The one from the other day
That does not help me
The comedy
Oh that one
Yeah that movie
It was austin powers
how have you not seen it before
I am not sure but i love it
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite comedies is Ted.
The teddie bear, right?
You got it.
That was a good movie.
We just watched the second one too.
I didn't see that one yet.
Just as good as the first.
Seth Mcfarlane is Ted isn't he?
Yes. He also wrote it, produced it, and directed it.
Talented man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie?
I think it would have to be Ace ventura Pet Detective.
Yea, that was a really funny movie.
I liked Jim Carrey, he was epic.
There were so many funny parts, especially how easy it was to do those voices.
I think its probably my favorite movie of all time.
I wouldnt go that far, but I love Jim Carey movies
Let's do a marathon of Ace Ventura this weekend!
I'm totally in.
I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I finally saw the South Park movie.
Didn't that come out like 20 years ago?
Something like that.  I'm a bit behind on my movies I guess.
You don't say?
That movie was so hilarious though.  Cartman gets me every time.
What about the songs?  Those were nuts.
I feel bad if I even tried to sing them in public!
I would sing them in the shower though.
Well, yeah.  Hey, that's a good idea, I should try that.
Yes, you should!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like the movie Tommy Boy?
I love it.
My son loves it too.
It's too bad Chris Farley died so young.
Yes I bet he would still be making funny movies.
He is one of my favorite actors.
Yes me too.
Did you see Black Sheep?
Yes that was pretty good too.
I liked the car they drove in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite comedy movie of all time?
I really liked the original Dumb and Dumber with Jim Carrey.
That is such a funny movie, did you see the sequel?
Yes, I try to pretend it didn't happen because of how bad it was.
Yeah, it wasn't as funny as the original, what other Jim Carrey comedies do you like?
I really enjoyed The Mask and The Cable Guy.
The Cable Guy was such a funny movie, I really liked Matthew Broderick in it.
Yes, though he wasn't as good as he was in Ferris Bueller.
Oh, I love that movie, so funny and good.
I love the part where he sings and dances on the float!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite comedic movie star?
Bill Murray, no doubt.
Which of his movies do you like?
Be easier to answer which ones don't I like.
Try. Which ones do you like.
Groundhog Day, Caddyshack is a classic. Quick Change isn't as well known as the others but is still great. He only has a small role in Tootsie, most people think of Dustin Hoffman, but Murray is really good in it Then there's Stripes, another Bill Murray classic.
Most of those are older movie. All of them actually. Anything new?
Again, he only had a small role in it but I loved his brief appearance in Zombieland
What other new movies has he done?
Most of his newer movies haven't really been comedies. St. Vincent and Lost in translation. If they're comedy, they're more subtle, more thoughtful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
American Pie is so funny
Which one?
I like them all.
What's your favorite?
The original is classic.
Yes it is.
Kind of frat guy humor.
It's a coming of age story.
They definitely go through a lot.
High school is a crazy time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite movie genre is comedy. What is yours?
Me too! I love the movie Dumb & Dumber and The Mask.
Jim Carey was super funny in Dumb & Dumber. Remember when he got his tongue frozen onto the ski chair?
Yes and then they were trying to pull his tongue off of it. That was so silly.
Yes! Remember the toilet scene when Harry got the runs and then it wasn't working?
Oh that was so disgustingly funny.
Do you remember when Lloyd and Harry were riding the scooter and they did a close up of Lloyd face with all the boogers on his face?
Oh my gosh yes. They were riding into Aspen, right?
Yes they were driving into Aspen.
They were such a mess. I loved them together in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the worst movie ever last night on Netflix.
What was it?
Freddy Got Fingered.
You're kidding me.
Nope, actually watched it.  The one with Tom Green.
When that came it out, it was one of the worst reviewed movies of all-time.
And well-deserved too.  I thought about turning it off.
Why didn't you?
Because I accidentally fell asleep watching it on the couch.
Trust me, you missed nothing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like romantic comedies?
Yes! I love Notting Hill.
That's a great movie.  Hugh Grant is adorable.
And so is Julia Roberts.
I don't really like her, but I like her there.
The bookstore is so cute.
I love the end, with them at the park with the gate.
Yes, that's like a fantasy.
I think the part about the painting was funny.
Yeah, that was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Best stupid movie... go!
Easy,  dumb and dumber. "So you're saying there's a chance!"
Haha yeah I love movies you can quote,  especially comedy.
Have you seen dirty work?
Is that the norm mcdonald one?
Yes,  where they start the revenge business.
Haha yeah it's great.  I also liked Tommy boy.  RIP Chris Farley.
No joke,  he was the best. Black sheep was hilarious.
He was good in that but I'm not a David spade fan.
Dude, David spade was in Tommy boy.....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen that movie 'Role Models'?
With Paul Rudd? Yeah, that movie's hilarious.
Paul Rudd is funny in everything pretty much.
He's so great as the surfer dude in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'.
That's the one with Russell Brand in too, right? Great movie.
Yeah, that's the one. It has Jason Segel in it too.
From 'How I Met Your Mother'? I should rewatch that movie again, it's so funny.
'Knocked Up' is another great one with Paul Rudd, too.
He's just a really funny guy. I can't think of anything I've seen him in that I didn't like.
Agreed - he's really funny and great at picking funny movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Daddy's Home 2 trailer looks funny.
Mel Gibson killed it! I'm in.
How many American Pie sequels did they make?
I think there is 4 but lets not forget the spin-offs.
That hair gel scene in Something About Mary was hilarious.
Ben Stiller at his best.
What's the name of the bar in Shaun of the Dead?
Its called the Winchester.
Best scene from Old School?
When Will Ferrell gets hit with the tranquilizer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite comedy movie that is also sci fi?
Without a doubt, Galaxy Quest.
I love that movie! Its hilarious.
I really love how it basically makes fun of Star Trek.
Its so odd how they have the guy who plays Snape in Harry Potter.
You mean Alan Rickman?
Yeah, hes an amazing actor.
He really is, he plays so many different roles very well.
Do you remember the quote he says?
By Grapthar's hammer, you shall be avenged.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm planning to stream some comedies this weekend, got any recommendations?
Yes! Watch "Popstar"!
Oh, the one with the Lonely Island Boys? I think they're hilarious!
Not exactly the Lonely Island Boys. Similar concept, but Andy Samberg plays this silly, vain popstar and he has sidekicks, which are the other two guys in Lonely Island.
Sounds funny. So there are a lot of songs too?
Yes, the songs are hilarious! I was crying.
They're that funny? Were there any cameos?
Yeah, tons, like Ringo Starr, Pink, Usher. It's sort of like a mockumentary.
I love mockumentaries, like "Waiting for Guffman" and all of Christopher Guest's movies.
I do too -- my favorite of his is "Best in Show." So funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The best comedy of all time is Christmas Vacation. Don't you think?
Definitely. I love it.
I must have watched it at least fifty times.
At least. Cousin Eddie is the best.
I love it when he kidnaps Clarks boss.
Yeah, and takes him to the house.
It's also great when the old mans wig catches on fire.
That was hilarious.
That was Chevy Chase's best movie.
It was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best time period for comedy movies?
I'd have to say probably mid to late nineties was when some of my favorite comedies came out.
Yea? Like which movies?
I really like the older Jim Carrey stuff like Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
Yes! Those are classics...I must have watched and re-watched those so many times as a kid.
Yea, comedies were so like silly and stupid back then. Nowadays everything is just super crude and sexual.
I know, it's like all these comedies nowadays are competing to see who can push the envelope the most and show the grossest, most outrageous thing.
Yea, I haven't seen a really good comedy that I really enjoyed in recent memory.
Like I said before, all the best comedies were made in the 90's.
This is true. Now I want to re-watch some of them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so what's your favorite Jim Carey movie?
Hmm, I don't know. Probably The Mask?
The Mask? Not Ace Ventura Pet Detective?
I mean, is Jim Carey even making movies anymore? Why not ask about Steve Carrell?
Well, at least I didn't say Adam Sandler.
Yeah, I would have nothing to say to that!
So what's your favorite Steven Carell movie?
Oddly enough, probably Bruce Almighty, which was Carell's breakout hit - AND, it was a Jim Carey movie.
Me too, but really I liked him best in The Office.
Oh dude, for sure. Show wasn't the same when he left...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Isn't Ghostbusters awesome?
Yes it is. It's one of the funniest movies ever.
Bill Murray is in so many good comedies.
Yeah he is., Ever seen Meatballs?
No, is it good?
Yeah, it's his first movie.
Cool, I'll check it out. Any others?
Yes, watch Kingpin.
Is he the main character in it?
No, Woody Harrelson is, but Bill Murray plays a really funny part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Bill Murray movie?
Well can I include older, unheard of movies?
Yes, of course!
Have you heard of the movie The Man Who Knew Too Little?
No, I haven't. Is it good?
Yes! It is my favorite Bill Murray movie of all time.
What is it about then?
Its about a guy who thinks hes an actor as a hitman, but it ends up being real.
Sounds like a thriller more than anything.
Yeah, but with Bill Murray it ends up being hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the Earnest movies?
When I was a kid.
Me too. They were pretty funny.
I watched one not too long ago.
How was it?
Liked em a lot better as a kid.
Sure. Gotta be in the right frame of mind.
That Jim Varney was a funny fellow.
Yeah. Did you hear he passed?
No! Not Earnest!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like the Anchorman movies?
Never seen them.
They are pretty funny if you ever get a chance to watch them.
What about the Hangover movies?
Yes I like them they were funny.
I like them also they should make another one.
Yes they should.
What about the new Ghostbusters did you like that one?
I didn't like it at all.
I will skip that one then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good comedy by the Coen Brothers?
There are plenty but I like Burn After Reading the most.
You like that more than The Big Lebowski?
I do. The Big Lebowski is a classic but burn after reading is smarter in my opinion.
Interesting. I might have to check that out again.
I would for sure. Do you like Brad Pitt?
He is great. I loved him in Fight Club.
Fight Club is great but this character is different.
What is different about him in this movie?
He plays a clumsy character who does stupid things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Adam Sandler films?
I like the ones with Drew Barrymore in them.
Me to. They're great together.
As for Adam the worst movie he ever did is 'The Water Boy.'
I agree. That character is annoying.
Yeah, even the voice is. I don't like that stupid voice he does.
What about the one in Little Nicky?
Also annoying. He's better without voices.
I kind of agree. He overdoes it.
Not as much as some actors but he does at times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They don't make comedy movies like they used to.
Sure they do.. look at Last Vegas and A Walk In The Woods
Can you name anymore?
Not at the moment but they are there.
Look at the 80s and you'll see true comedy classics.
Oh come on, most of those are just screwball comedies that you need an IQ of single digits to really understand.
Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Big Business, Three Men And A Baby are all excelent comedies just to name a few.
A typical road trip comedy where an uptight snob changes his ways by the end of the movie.  That's hardly a classic.
That's better than movies that think being gross and disgusting qualifies as good comedy fun.
Everyone's a critic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best Mel Brooks movie?
I would probably say Blazing Saddles.
I would go with Young Frankenstein.
That's a very solid choice.
You can't go wrong with either of them really.
I give the edge to Blazing Saddles only because it was a bit more raunchy.
I thought it was an interesting take on race relations for sure.
I don't think I ever saw the sheriff in another movie.
Yeah, that was pretty much his one shining moment.
At least it was memorable for him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Just rewatch Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
Love that show!
Bob Hoskins is one of my favorites.
His best role has to be in Hook.
As Smee?
That's the one.
He played that so well.
How could you go wrong opposite Dustin Hoffman?
A magnificent Hook!
"Bad form, Peter!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude you seen step brothers?
Man Will Ferrell is fantastic in that!
I love the scene with the bunk beds!
MORE ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES
Oh man what about the fluffy movie?
Oh the one with Gabriel Iglesias?
Yeah dude!
Oh it's amazing
Friggin chocolate cake shake sounds amazing
We should make one
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the funniest movie you've ever seen?
I think The Hangover is one of the best. Zach Galifianakis is perfect for his role.
Really? I thought it was a bit hyped up. I really think I liked him better in The Due Date.
I haven't heard of that. Who else is in it?
Robert Downey, Jr. is the other main character in the film.
Oh! Now it's ringing a bell. Robert Downey, Jr. usually does more action films.
That's true, but he was great in Due Date and also in Tropic Thunder.
Oh yes! Ben Stiller's in that as well, right?
Yeah, he is. You can't beat him in Zoolander though.
True. Zoolander might be one of my other favorite comedies of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think today's comedies are as good as some classics?
What do you consider a classic comedy?
Stripes, Blazing Saddles, movies like those.
I love both those movies, but times have changed and I prefer newer comedies, as well as ones from the 90's and 2000's.
Do you like slapstick comedies or others?
I like any comedy. I was a huge fan of Sandler's early movies, especially Happy Gilmore.
I liked that one too- the more over-the-top, the better for me.
My new favorite is Kevin Hart. Just listening to his voice cracks me up most of the time.
I love him too- at first it seemed like he was trying to be like Eddie Murphy, but found his own way. I love him and Ice Cube as a team.
Similar to me with Chris Tucker years ago with the "Rush Hour" movies. Just listening to him talk is worth the admission price.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen any of the Austin Powers movies?
Yeah, the one called "A Spy Who Shagged Me".
Haha, I love that one.
It's one of my favorite movies with Mike Myers.
Me too, But I did think he was a really good voice actor for Shrek.
That's a good point. Even though its a kids movie it still is really fun to watch.
Definitely. I wish Mike Myers did more voice acting for animated films.
He would have been a great addition to Toy Story.
Haha, definitely. I can only imagine how much more funny that movie would have been.
I'm sure it would be much more funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good comedy movie to watch with a guy?
Guys don't really like romantic comedies, so I would go with something that is comedy and action.
Okay, so what is good example of that?
I really liked Ride Along 2. Kevin Hart is really funny.
Oh yeah, I saw that. I think he and Ice Cube make a great pair.
I agree. It was almost just as funny as the first one. I'm glad they made a sequel.
I thought the first one was hilarious. But you're right, the sequel wasn't bad.
It had action and some slapstick comedy, which is always great.
I liked the part when Kevin Hart's character was pretending to be the African prince.
It really looked like Ice Cube punched him. I think he enjoyed that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am bored blah
Whats up
I am just sitting at home doing nothing much
Well then do something
i do not know what to do
How about i come over and we can watch the funniest movie of all time
What movie is that
Walk hard duh
What is it about
A country star and his rise to fame but it is funny is can be
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite comedy movie?
Knocked Up
Oh my goodness I love that movie.
Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen were great.
Yes they were.
I heard Katherine Heigl adopted after that movie. She didn't want to get pregnant.
Are you serious?
Yes I heard it on tv once.
That is hilarious.
Yes I know the movie spooked her that much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Adam Sandler the funniest comedian of all time?
No he had a couple good movies 20 years ago.
Right but most comics dont go on that long
Sure they do
Like who?
Will Ferrell has had way more funnier movies
I think Billy Madison was the funniest comedy ever
Thats being a little crazy!
Why? The one liners were great
They were but not greatest of all time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite comic actor?
I would have to say Robin Williams.
Oh yeah, he was always hysterical, I first saw him in Good Morning Vietnam.
Every time I tell someone good morning I have a flash of him saying it over the radio.
I can't eat a banana cream pie without think of Mrs. Doubtfire and when he shoved his face in the pie.
I know exactly what you mean. I would have voted for him as President in Man of the Year.
Me too, he always made me feel better on a bad day, even when he had a serious role.
He knew how to make serious not be so serious.
I could have see him playing the joker in a batman movie.
The world lost a lot of laughs when he died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like comedy movies?
Yeah sure.
What was the last one you watched?
I saw the waterboy.
Was that on tv?
I watched it on netflix.
Oh okay didn't realize it was on there.
Yeah, netflix is great for comedies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have an all time favorite comedy?
Yes! I love Meet the Fockers with Ben Stiller!
Oh yeah, I love him in Zoolander also!
Basically, every movie he does has 5 stars from me!
Barbara Streisand played his mother, right?
Yes and she is a therapist and gives the funniest advice.
What the name of the other funny guy in the movie with blonde hair?
Oh! You probably are talking about Owen Wilson!
He plays Pamela's ex boyfriend.
It's good to be in the circle of trust and we use that joke all the time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite comedy movie?
I really love Father of the Bride.
Wow that's an old movie.
Yeah, but I love Steve Martin. He is a classy kind of funny.
That's true. The comedy movies today are so dirty it's almost not even funny.
Well there is nothing dirty in that movie, him and martin short are hilarious.
I think I've seen that one. That is where the wife and daughter get pregnant at the same time, right?
It sure is. I really love when Steve Martin takes those pills and he passes out at the table.
Yeah and then Martin Short tries to walk with him on his back and he slowly sinks to the floor.
Martin Short's accent is hilarious. I really love that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The 40 year old virgin?
Yes I have and it was hilarious! Steve Carrel cracks me up.
He is so funny. I thought Seth Rogen did a good lowkey job in that movie too.
And the dialogue was so clever. They made you believe a man could actually be a virgin at 40.
Those guys when they get together make some really funny movies. Do you like Adam Sandler?
I definitely do. Happy Gilmore is my favorite movie of his.
Oh yeah? Mine is Little Nicky.
I think it's funny how we blatantly puts his sponsors in the spotlight in those movies.
You're right. It becomes like a little easter egg hunt to spot the sponsors.
Click was an excellent movie by him too. It was a little different from his usual but surprisingly heartwarming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Zombieland?
Is that a horror movie?
Not really, it's more of a comedy.
Oh, is it the one with Woody Harrelson?
Yeah, he's in it.
There are zombies in it though.
Yeah, and the people are traveling together.
To some kind of fun park in California, right?
Yeah, but when they get there, it's already overrun by zombies.
Yeah, I've seen it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Neighbors?
Is that the movie with Zac Efron?
Yes and Seth Rogen
Is anyone else in that?
James Franco's brother.
Oh yeah right. It was pretty funny.
The sequel was not that good.
Most comedy sequels arent..
Are they making a third?
Lord I hope not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Guess this one "We're on a mission from Gad."
Blues Brothers!
You're good!
I love that show!
What's your favorite part?
Probably the Ray Charles scene. Yours?
When Carrie Fisher is hunting down Jake.
Classic!
They had so many big music names in that!
A veritable who's who!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Better comedy Monty Python and The Holy Grail, or Groundhog Day?
Is this a serious question? Groundhog Day is enjoyable, if a bit overplayed on TV, but Python all the way.
I would agree if we were talking The Life of Brian, but always felt Holy Grail was overrated.
No way, how could you not laugh at some of the scenes?
Notice I never said I didn't laugh, it's still a funny film, although never been huge on British humor.
Well I will concede that Life of Brian was even better and while I love Bill Murray, Groundhog Day isn't on the same level.
Well we can agree to disagree, Murray makes anything better.
Oh he does indeed, but Monty Python makes everything better as well.
I did really laugh at the banging coconuts for hooves.
Ha yeah that was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Ace Ventura?
Yes, Jim Carrey is great.
Did you see part 2?
Yeah, it is just as good as part 1.
Did you hate the beginning?
Yes, it was so sad when that raccoon fell.
I know. I cried when I saw that scene. The rest of the movie was funny though.
Remember when he fought that tiny tribal guy?
Yeah, that was hilarious.
And I will always remember that quote from part 1 "Do not... go in there!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite movies is The 40-Year Old Virgin.
That was a star maker for Steve Carell.
The scene where he gets his chest hair pulled off.
That was great.  I think the scene was all real.
It's a funny movie with a heart.
Yes, I like when there is more then just slapstick.
A bit of a buddy movie with his co-workers.
Yes, lets not forget Paul Rudd was in the movie and very funny.
I also like Catherine Keener.  She's a terrific actress.
Yes, I've seen her in several movies.  Always excellent.
