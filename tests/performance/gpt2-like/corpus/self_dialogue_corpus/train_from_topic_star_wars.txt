Hey.
Hi.
Are you a fan of the Star Wars series?
Yeah love them.
Me too.
Cool.
Who is your least favorite character?
Without a doubt Jar Jar Binks.
Oh man, same here.
Absolutely hate him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's you favorite Star Wars character?
Yoda, it is.
Don't you wish he was in the new movies?
Dead he is.
Well, it's a movie. He could show up.
Improbable that would be.
But Obi Wan was a ghost.
True that is.
What about young Yoda? Like when he was in training?
Yes, interesting that would be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, so what do you think was the worst part about the Phantom Menace?
Oh, man, just ONE worst part?  It's so hard to choose.. there's so many.
I know, I know, but for me, it had to be the  Midi-chlorians.
Oh, God, don't remind me of those.
Yeah, i mean, first film it establishes the Force as some kind of a mystical life force like "chi" or something that binds the universe and then.
And then it's all, "No, it's actually just a bunch of microscopic bugs."
Exactly! I really don't know what Lucas was thinking on that.
I hate to say it buuut...
Oh, go ahead.
I think he was just giving a giant middle finger to the audience.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who's your favorite star wars villain?
wow! tough choice
you better not pick kylo
who would pick kylo? definitely not me
good. i knew there was a reason i keep you around
because you have good taste?
let's get back to your taste.
okay okay. i guess my favorite is darth
cliche, but a good enough choice
he's classic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite evil guy in Star Wars?
Obviously Darth Vader is the best and the original bad guy of Star Wars.
Yeah but did you know that he was supposed to be killed off in the first movie?
I can't imagine the movies without him. His voice and costume is so iconic.
Yeah but he is only on screen for like 12 minutes in the first movie, even though he is pretty much a main character.
I just learned that they guy doing the voice isn't the same guy that is actually doing the acting.
James Earl Jones does the voice, even though he isn't listed in the credits. David Prowse did the acting.
His voice was perfect for that role!  He also did Mufasa in the Lion King.
Even though they played the same character, David and Earl never actually met eachother.
That would be so weird to be playing the same person but never meet the other half.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, I watched the Force Awakens, I am lost.
By what? Good film.
I liked it, but was the force sleeping before?
No, it just means that a new Jedi had emerged.
Well, if it is Rey, then why did it not wake when Klyo came into power.
Klyo went to the dark side, he is not a Jedi.
If he is not a Jedi, why was he at Jedi school.
He was Luke's Padwan, but he turned. It has not been shown why. He is no longer Jedi, he is sith now.
Wait, I thought sith was a race.
No, Vader was human, well pretty much, but went from Jedi to Sith. Like Yoda is whatever he is, but is also a Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite star wars movie?
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
Why do you like this one the most?
This movie had the most action.
Yes, this one was great.
What about you?
I really liked the last star wars movie. It started slow but I really liked it.
I haven't seen that one yet, what did you like about it.
I like how they tied all the loose ends together from the previous movie.
Sounds great, I can't wait until I see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How come you never see Leia use the force?
Yeah, i've always wondered that. I mean her brother and father were both powerful force users, and yet she never uses it.
I thought I read that she has the power to use the force but just chooses not to.
Hmm, that makes sense, but still I don't fully understand why she doesn't. It probably could have helped in the war against the Empire.
Yeah, I had hoped for some dialogue related to her reluctance to use the force in the last movie, "Force Awakens", but no, nothing.
She was called a general in that movie though, so she was still very much in the war efforts, just not as a Jedi.
And then her son, Ben, turns all Sith and joins the dark side. That had to have factored into her reasons to stay away from the call of the force, don't you think?
Yeah, I would think so. I mean, her dad is dead, her brother ran away and her son is evil. I can see why she doesn't want anything to do with the force now, but still doesn't explain the past.
Guess we'll never know. I'm sure she had her reasons though.
I wonder if there's any fan fiction about that topic? I should look that up when I get home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Have you seen all the star wars films?
Yes as a matter of fact I have.
Cool me too.
Nice.
Out of all of those do you have a least favorite?
Definitely one from the prequels.
Which one?
Probably Clone Wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the older Star Wars movies or the newer movies?
I prefer the older movies.  I'm older and they were really big when I was younger.
Who's your favorite character?
I really like Chewy.  He doesn't say much but gets the job done.
He and Han are great together.
It's almost as if they can read each other's minds.
What is your favorite scene in the three older movies?
When Luke finds out that Vader is his father.
What is your least favorite character ?
I really don't like the Sand People.  I find them really creepy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the force awakens
Yes
Its my favorite star wars movie
Thats one of mine too
I love harrison ford in it
Hes makes a great hans solo
He really does
He is a great actor
Yes im glad he was in the movies
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
So midichorians are basically mitochondria, right?
Yeah, ugh. I guess that's not... too well-hidden.
What's the theory there? Mitochondria produce all the energy for cells, right?
Yeah, but... I don't know that this bears much scrutiny.
Bear with me, though. So the midichlorians produce an energy that's present in everyone, but Jedi are busting with the things.
Okay, so... this is sounding a little like Parasite Eve now.
I guess, but -- no. I'm saying that Jedi are just pumping out this heavy aura of energy on a cellular level that, if trained, can do all kinds of wacky stuff.
Okay. So... I guess that's kind of reconciling the Episode One business with the original explanation then?
Yes, exactly! I mean, sort of. Everyone embodies the Force, and theoretically could learn to control it -- but Jedi are sort of freaks who produce way more of the Force, so when they're trained it's way more effective.
There's a weird class issue here, or maybe even a eugenic model, that disturbs me on a pretty deep level.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Imagine what it would like in the Star Wars universe. What if you're a regular guy who just finds a light saber on the ground.
With how often the Jedi lose them, it probably happens a lot.
The guy probably hang it on his wall at home.
He tells the girls he brings home, "Yeah. i killed a jedi and took his saber."
He'd probably end up lopping off an arm at some point.
His? Or someone else's?
Depends on how drunk he is, I'd imagine.
How do you explain that to the doctor?
"Dang jedi just walked up and took my arm off!"
They're all robot doctors. I don't know if they'd buy that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Star Wars character do you dislike the most?
I really don't like Jar Jar Binks!
Why don't you like that character?
Jar Jar Binks is just really annoying!
I also find Jar Jar Binks extremely annoying.
I think they just added Jar Jar Binks as a comic relief character.
Yes I totally agree with you!
There are moments I found funny when I saw Jar Jar Binks on screen.
The way Jar Jar Binks says "me" as "meesa" makes me laugh.
It also makes me laugh!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Mandela Effect  quding Star Wars?
I am not sure I know what you are talking about.
Empire Strikes Back the scene where Luke finds out Darth Vader is his dad. What is the line that Darth says?
Luke I am your Father.
Yes that's what I remember and a lot of other people as well.
So what are you saying? That it's wrong?
According to some fans they insist he "No, I am your father" not Luke I am your father.
What? I may not be as big of a nerd about Star Wars as you are but i know Luke is right.
Yes there are interviews of James Earl Jones back in the day and when asked to quote that scene he says Luke.
Who would know better than him? That's really weird.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you actually watch the original Star Wars when it was originally released?
Yes I was seven years old in 1977.
Did you go by yourself?
No I went with one of my older sisters and my twin sister.
Do you really remember the whole movie?
Well first of all we got there a little late; but the first thing I remember seeing was Darth Vader on a ship walking among dead bodies.
I would say you missed about the first ten minutes of the movie then.
The other scene I remember is the one when Han Solo comes back after everyone believes he's gone.
Is that a the end of the movie?
Almost at the end of the movie, Darth Vader is about to shoot Luke's ship but Han saves him by shooting Darth's ship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm still bitter about George Lucas re-editing the middle three movies.
I don't blame you.  I don't think they added anything.
The worst part was at the end of Return of the Jedi.
Oh, when he put in Hayden Christensen?
Yeah - I never wanted to see him again.
Same here - he drained all the energy out of the room.
Plus, they changed the music at the end.  I liked the original song better.
You actually liked that song?  Ha!
In my defense, I was five when the original came out.
Now I have something new to hold against you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you watched all of the movies, which order would you view them?
Ah, that's a highly debated question.  I guess I would go chronologically.
Really?  Interesting.
Yeah.  I think I would want to see the rise and fall of Anakin before I watched the stories of his children.
See, now I'm more apt to go in order of release.
Really?
Yes.  So, I would stars with Star Wars, then Empire Strikes Back, then Return of the Jedi, then I would...
I get it.  Then you would move on to Episodes 1, 2, and 3.
Exactly.  And then I'd finish with The Force Awakens and Rogue One.
Well, luckily there is no wrong way to watch the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in Star Wars?
I like C-3PO.
He is really good. Which movie is he the best in?
He is awesome in the first movie.
Yeah, they really developed his character well.
Do you like R2-D2 as well?
Yes, he is really funny.
Did you like him in the prequels?
No, it was just a little strange to see him there.
Yeah, he should have just been in the originals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Jabba the Hut was supposed to be furry?
Huh?  You're making that up.
No, I'm serious.  He was originally written as a furry character.
I just can't even picture that.
Yeah, I guess the idea got dumped because they didn't think he'd be scary enough.
Jabba is pretty ugly looking with his pasty skin and what not.
If he was furry, you'd just want to pet him, not hurt him.
That would have been an odd dynamic for the series.
I'm glad George Lucas came to his senses.
At least he did about something!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Red Letter Media?
I don't know think so.. what's it about?
It's this guy who does reviews on Youtube.  One of the things he's most famous for it this several of his Star Wars movie reviews, including the Phantom Menace.
No, I haven't.
Oh, man, it is HILARIOUS!  I mean, he doesn't just nitpick things, but he offers a lot of really wise insight while pretending to be this deranged old guy.
Oh, man, it's sounds pretty funny.
It is.  You'll have to look it up.  I mean, he points out things like, there's no real protagonist in the movie.
Uh.. isn't that Anakin?
No, not really.  I mean, he doesn't show up until about the middle of the film, and pretty much affects the story only by accident.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.  He just hits a few buttons and the ship takes off on it's own.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
Of course, but I like the old ones the best.
The old movies made or the oldest storyline?
The older movies. The ones with Harrison Ford and Leia.
Yea. I would have to agree. Although, the ones coming out now are doing pretty good in the box office.
Agreed. But George Lucas made his name off of those old movies.
That's true. They kind of messed up on those middle movies with Jar Jar Binks and the likes.
Exactly. I am glad they are back to their winning ways.
Me too. So many people love Star Wars. It is nice to see them do good movies.
Yep. And they make more money too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just came back from Seeing The Force Awakens. I don't understand why people think that Rey is a Mary Sue.
Because she can do everything so easily, without any training.
Yes, she did everything so quickly and so easily, like she was following some sort of quick and easy path.
You think she's going Dark Side?
Just watch it.  She's a huge ball of anger, and she uses the Force when he's angry, it's classic Dark Side.
I don't think that's the intent.
Maybe it wasn't, but the signs are there.  She doesn't start beating Kylo until she's angry. That's Dark Side right there.
That's a good point.  Rey is flirting with the Dark Side.  I don't think the guys at Disney are that subtle, either.
True. It's possible that they completely missed the point.  I wouldn't put that past them. But that's why we have death of the author.
I bet the next movie completely fails to confirm your idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard they got a new director for Episode VIII.
Really?
Yup.
But Abrams did such a great job.
He usually does.
Guess they just wanted to change it up.
I guess. I hope it's as good as the first.
We'll find out soon.
He didn't direct the last Star Trek either.
What is up with these studios?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the new Star Wars movie?
I don't know, I have not seen it.
Haven't seen it? It is like the most watched movie in forever. Why haven't you seen it?
I am not really interested in new movies. They always try to explain things that should be left to the imagination.
I don't understand, can you explain?
Well I think that the Phantom Menace was a waste of a movie since they used the whole build up of the movie over explained Darth Vader so it took away all imaginations for him.
I liked the Phantom Menace, I thought it was a good story line.
Story line yes but it changed the whole dynamic of the movies for me.
Change the dynamic how?
It began to explain Darth Vader and at the end I actually felt a little pity for him. Prior to that Darth Vader was a true villain. One should not have any sympathy for a villain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What movies do you like
My favorite is star wars
I love star wars
Me too
They are great movies
I liked the comics better
Me too
But the movies were okay
Yes they were
Nice talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the original trilogy or the prequels?
I definitely like the originals more but I really like Revenge of the Sith.
I do too, it is probably my third favorite movie.
What's your favorite? Mine is The Empire Strikes Back
My favorite is actually A New Hope, but Empire comes next.
Do you like the new movie at all, I thought it was alright but not great.
I liked it but thought it was only better than The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.
I could agree with that, it was trying too hard to be the originals.
I think that's true, and it didn't have any real significant moments besides Hans ending.
Yeah, I do look forward to the next movies though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think would win in a lightsaber battle, Luke or Rey?
Obviously Rey.
Why? Luke has more practice.
Luke is also older, and Rey is already good without learning anything.
True. Still, I think Luke would win.
Actually, we're both wrong.
Why?
Yoda wins, obviously.
That's true.
Yoda always wins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, what was one of the biggest shocks in Stars Wars?
What do you mean by biggest shock?
I mean, the most shocking or unexpected revealation in the movies.
Well, the whole "Luke, I am your Father" was a doozy when you first learned it.
Yes, it was definitley not something you'd see coming.
Them there's the whole Luke and Leia are brother and sister thing.
Oh, don't remind me, makes the whole kiss on Hoth a bit akward.
Yeah, goes from " You lucky so and so" to " I hear banjos, run!"
Other than that, I can't think of any more real shocking revealtions.
Neither can I, since with the prequels we all knew where we were going in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the new Star wars, the old Star Wars or the ones in the middle?
I think the old star wars, Luke, Leai and Hans, are best.
They had a good bit of story to dig into.
It was the relationships, like Han and Leai, the slow burn into love.
Their relationship really played out well, I was invested.
The witty come back between the two always made me smile, like they really did like one another.
I like that they came from world apart.
Yes, he was a bit of a scoundrel and her a princess, it was a wrong side of the tracks love.
Did you like the part when he was about to be frozen and she said she loved him.
And he said, "I know", got me everytime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the role of Anakin Skywalker?
I loved the story behind him.
Yeah but did you love the way he was played.
I thought it could have had room for improvement.
How about Natalie Portman's character
She did a great job as a ruler.
I think it was good too
I just think people dont love the prequels
I always caution against going backwards in a film.
Im glad the franchise is going forward now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the latest Star Wars Movie?
I really liked it, how do you think the next one will be?
Well I really hope it turns out better.
Yea me too.
Personally I thought the last one that came out was a little week.
Why do you think that?
Because they didn't really explain things all that well.
Isn't that what they're suppose to do? Make you wonder?
Yea, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more than what the ending gave.
Yea that would have been nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was so excited about the first new Star Wars Movie.
Why is that?
There were several reasons, not just one.
Such as?
I was excited about the stars that I remembered from childhood being a part of them.
I enjoyed this also, though I am much younger than you.
Why do you have to remind me of this? Princess Leia was my favorite.
I enjoyed her too, and it's too bad that she won't be around for the premiere of the next movie.
Yes, I cried when I heard about Carrie Fisher's death.
She was an inspiration.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
It's okay
What did you like about it
the space battles
I liked Jar Jar
He wasn't a popular character
I thought he was funny
He was too goofy
He was a bad as a  senator
That's true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the greatest Sith? Other than Vader, that's too easy.
Darth Maul is my favorite.
He's not that powerful in the force though. His skill is all sword play.
I don't agree. It would take incredible force powers to master his double sword.
Maybe, but he doesn't seem to use any other force techniques with any regularity.
Like what?
Force push, force choke, force jump, things like that.
Does anyone other than Darth Vader?
Kylo Ren uses force moves quite a bit. Remember when he stopped that laser blast in mid-air?
That was cool. Do you think he is more powerful than Vader?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know one of the actors is banned from Star Wars events?
Really?  That seems strange and bizarre.
Yeah.  Apparently, George Lucas doesn't like him and think he's annoying?
Harrison Ford?  Mark Hamill?
No, it's actually the guy who played Darth Vader in the original movies.
Oh, I know who you're talking about.  I think his name is David Prowse.
Since he didn't voice Vader, I guess they don't seem inclined to stick up for him.
Well, anyway can play Vader so they don't need to kiss up to him.
He's the one actor you would never be able to spot since his most famous role called for him wearing a mask.
That's gotta be a strange feeling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The only one of the prequel Star Wars movies I really like is Revenge of the Sith.
Is that the third one?
Yeah. It's the climax of the prequels.
Why do you like that one? I never even got around to seeing it.
Well, I can understand that. The second one is very bad.
It's just so slow, and the twists come out of nowhere.
The first one, too, felt a bit unnecessary. And the explanation for what the force is doesn't help.
Yeah, that was rough. It made it feel less mystical.
The third one, though, it helps you understand who Anakin is. And he's really the protagonist of the series.
I've never thought of it that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the original Star Wars trilogy?
Yes, my favorite was The Empire Strikes Back.  I really liked when Luke went to Dagoba!
Yeah, Yoda is one of my favorite characters.
It was really cool when he got the x-wing out of the swamp after Luke failed to from a lack of faith.
I think Yoda must have been one of the most powerful jedi.
Me too, though I think Obi-wan Kenobi was becoming nearly as wise.  Especially after all his time on Tatooine.
Do you think he really didn't recognize R2-D2 and C-3P0 in A New Hope?
It does seem kind of strange, but I suppose it had been nearly 20 years since he had last seen them.  Maybe he figured they had been sent to the spice mines of Kessel already (or at least 3P0.
It is rather a wonder that 3P0 survived as long as he had.  He must have had a ton of luck, or caused endless trouble for R2.
Yeah, I'm leaning more toward the endless trouble...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the podracers engines are based off of real jet engines?
I didn't, is that what they actually look like?
Yes, if you look at a picture of a jet engine and compare it to anakins podracer they are exactly alike.
Another fun fact is the guy who played Darth Maul also appears without his evil makeup in another scene.
Which one? I'm not even sure I'd know what he looked like without the makeup.
He is one of the Naboo soldiers who is helping Padme get to her throne room in Theed.
Oh wow, that's cool!
The guy who played Darth Maul is named Ray Park, he is a professional stunt man and fight choreographer.
Does he still do sword fights?
He does, he still works in movies today sometimes and he even does his Darth Maul routine at Star Wars events for fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the connection between rae and kylo?
I am convinced they are brother and sister.
I was wondering that as well. But the actors don't look anything alike.
Driver and Ridley both have dark features. Also not mandatory to look alike.
I suppose that is true, luke and leia were twins and looked entirely different.
Exactly. I am excited to see what will be revealed next, Like what is going on with luke now?
It seems like he is somewhat like the original movies obi wan kenobi, hermit like in style.
That is a similarity there between luke now and obi wan. I love both those characters.
Me too. so iconic and classic. I am so happy they brought mark hamill back.
Ya me too. I was so sad when ford's han solo was killed off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Star Wars Movie?
Return of the Jedi, you?
I, for one, loved The Force Awakens.
Yea, but there is nothing quite like the originals.
Of course not, but the special effects are way different now, I enjoy those.
What about the plot lines, the character development?
What about it?
The newer movies just don't capture the same magic the original trilogy did.
Yes they do! Don't you think they covered the gaping hole of the death stars weakness int he last movie?
Yes, because they had to. Just like they had to kill Han Solo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who played Luke Skywalker?
Mark Hammil
Who played Han Solo?
Harrison Ford
Was this Harrison Ford's first film?
No
Who directed Star Wars?
George Lucas
Who was the producer?
Gary Kurtz
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why didn't the Wookie get a medal in A New Hope?
What are you talking about?
At the end of the movie everone gets a medal but Chewy.
Huh, I had no idea.
Weird, huh?
Maybe nobody wanted to get close enough to present him.
It was Leia though.
I haven't a clue.
It's been bugging me for the last 30 years or so.
Oh, Lord!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Jabba the Hut in the Star Wars movies?
I thought that he was creepy.
Me too!
I wish he had some sort of clothes on.
That would of made everything better.
I was also freaked out when he made Princess Leia his slave.
I really hated that part!
Yeah, I am glad that Princess Leia got her revenge.
In my opinion, Jabba the Hut deserved it.
Yes, he so did!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the Star Wars droids is your favorite?
Doesn't everyone love R2-D2?
Yes, although I think C-3PO is my favorite?
I always found him a little too prim and proper.
Yes, the accent can be annoying sometime.
Not just that, but the whole idea of a protocol droid.
Yes.    Why would a child like Annakin build such a thing?
Maybe it was a kit that he was working from.
Perhaps.     Maybe best to not take that part of the series too literally.
Yes, it is just a space fantasy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the most mysterious person in Star Wars?
I think Boba Fett
Why do you say that?
Maybe I don't know the plot inside and out but I dont know his background!
Doesn't he have a kid or something too?
Yeah I wonder what his name is and what he is up to now!
Who else is mysterious?
I would like to know more about Darth Maul
What about him?
How he got such a cool lightsaber!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes, I've seen it many times.
Who is your favorite character in the Empire Strikes Back?
Definitely Yoda, my favorite character of any science-fiction movie.
What your favorite thing about Yoda?
His facial expressions, they're funny.
I always wondered how they made his costume so realistic.
I wonder if there was a real person inside?
Darth Vader definitely had a real person inside.
Darth Vader, now that's my favorite villain of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like luke or anakin
anakin
why?
anakin was reckless and exciting
yeah. luke was not as interesting.
he was kinda less questioning and more obedient
anakin did a lot of rebellious stuff
like when he jumped out the ship
and still beat up enemies and stuff
yeah, he was cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you remember the climax of Return of the Jedi?
Where Vader picks up the Emperor and throws him down that shaft?
Yeah.  Here's something I find weird... I've heard different explanations for that big explosion of blue energy.
Really?
Yeah, some of the books say it happened because the Emperor was full of Dark Side energy and all, so that when someone like that dies the energy explodes outward.
Weird, don't remember that happening when Darth Maul was killed.  Or Count Dooku for that matter...
Yeah, true, that's one confusing aspect.  But you know what i always thought?
What's that?
I figured the explosion because his body hit some kind of  energy reactor.   After all, the explosion is the same blue color as reactor thing down at the very bottom of the shaft.
Huh, that theory makes me sense to me than the whole Dark Side thing. But, then again, the color is also the same as the Force Lightning the Emperor was torturing Luke with..
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie?
Which one do you mean?
I mean The Last Jedi.
Oh yes, I can't wait!
Are you also excited for the Han Solo movie?
Yes, I am. I am a little worried that it will be as good as Rogue One or not.
Yeah, me too. I did hear yesterday that Disney fired the two people who were directing it because their creative vision didn't align.
I heard that too, I think that is a good sign.
I bet they were trying to make it all artsy and have the characters be all sexual and emo and that's not what Disney is about.
Yeah I take it as a good sign that Disney is willing to fire directors if they feel they aren't taking Star Wars in the direction they want.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite weapon in star wars
What do you think
I think it is obvious
Well?
A light saber
Wrong
What?!!
It is not
Fine what is it
The blaster the noise is fun
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about the theory that rey is obi wan's daughter?
i honestly hate it. it makes no sense
really? he was in hiding for a long time, yo udon't think obi could have found a boo?
no, i don't. i think she's related to the skywalkers
why?
because she's so force sensative!
i guess only a skywalker could move the force that well
exactly! plus, i really want her to be related to kylo ren
why?
because people keep saying they should be together, and that's nasty! let's shut that down
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Force Awakens?
I didnt like it that much, I'm a Star Wars fan but think the last movie wasnt as good.
I agree, I think theres many flaws, hopefuly this will get fixed.
What character did you like the most?
I liked the villain, I thought hes light saver was pretty cool.
Yeah it was, it would be interesting to see how he got trained.
I wonder how the next Star Wars movie will be like.
It will be interesting to watch Kilo Ren fight Luke.
That would be a pretty cool fight.
I wonder if Luke can put up a fight after all this time.

Who is the most annoying person in Star Wars?
I think it would be Young Anakin
Why do you say that?
Maybe it's just his acting but he is so over the top with everything
Oh, like during his pod race?
Yeah he seems so fake.
He got a little better though, he wasn't always so inexperienced with his acting
I wonder what that actor is up to now!
He hasn't been in any movies that I know of!
I liked him in Star Wars, he was just a little kid. I should cut him some slack
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the concept of the Death Star in Star Wars?
I do actually.
I was wondering if you thought it was practical like it could be actually done?
I think a weapon could be created like that but not in the same way.
How so?
I don't think we could ever create a weapon that is essentially a planet/moon just would require hundreds of years, that's a lot of space to use and build something that large inside of it.
That's a good point.
Do you think it was a cool concept?
I absolutely loved the idea and it was rather shocking.
Yeah it was a big twist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the robots R2-D2 in the old trilogy?
He was alright.
Just alright he was a genius robot.
Yeah but the other one the gold human looking one was more of the brains of the operation.
R2-D2 didn't have voice capatability but he was smart.
Yes I suppose he was as smart as you could expect.
Do you think they were created in the same place or factory?
I doubt it they're too totally different models of robot.
That's a good point but still think it's possible?
Yeah anythings possible just unlikely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Star Wars prequels.
Episodes one through Three, or the chronological sequels?
A bit confusing, I know, but Episode one through Three.
I think they do not get the credit they deserve, I liked them.
I did too, I thought the plot played well.
It did. It showed a back story into the rise of Darth Vader.
From a lowly Anakin, on the sand planet to all and powerful.
Yes. It showed both his rise and the start of his fall, very complex.
You did not think it was contrived at all?
No, it was mean to be what it was. A story into the past, of the movies at least.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Star Wars movies?
You mean The Force Awakens and Rogue One?
Yes I thought they were great, did you?
I did but truthfully I saw those before I watched the first six episodes. I had to go back and watch them.
What's your favorite of the original episodes?
I'd have to say A New Hope.
That's mine too. You know, I didn't even know Darth Vader was a cyborg.
Me neither! I just learned that. He's my favorite character though.
My favorite is Princess Leia.
Yes it was a shock to find out she was Darth Vader's daughter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, so I can probably guess, but what is your least favorite Star Wars movie?
Definitely the Phantom Menace.
Because of Jar Jar?
Yeah, he's awful, but I thought the whole movie was a let-down after waiting so long?
Why?
It's kinda dull, with the race and little Anakin is annoying. The only good thing is the Darth Maul fight.
I have to agree-- I thought it was creepy there was a budding romance between Amidala and Anakin.
Yeah, that kid was like 8, and she had to be at least 16 or so.
All of the prequels under-delivered in my opinion.
Yeah, the series didn't really get good again until they took control from George Lucas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite villain from Star Wars?
Darth Vader
What do you think of Darth Maul?
I liked him a lot.
I wish they put him in more movies
Yes. It was a mistake to kill him in the first one.
I agree. I do not think Christopher Lee worked in the second one.
What did you like about Darth Maul?
The Lightsaber and the paint.
Yes. That was very cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
I love it!
Do you think it's realistic?
It would be realistic if it was easier to travel faster in space
Yeah, I could see something like that happening
I think it would not be likely for there to be so many aliens
There is no force.
Some buildings are a bit tall
It inspires me to work hard
It inspires me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that George Lucas didn't originally write Luke and Leia to be twin siblings?
How do you know that?
I read the script for the first Star Wars. Luke was introduced as being 20 years old, and Leia was introduced as being 16.
So the love interest angle that they hinted at in Star Wars, that was the point originally.
Right. It was only after the huge success of Star Wars, and the plans for a sequel, that Lucas retconned Luke and Leia into being twins.
Actually, that was a really good storyline. I loved it in Empire and Return of the Jedi when Leia could sense Luke through the Force.
And in Empire, we all just thought it was the Force - not that the two of them were bonded as siblings.
It made for an interesting love triangle, until it was revealed that the two were siblings.
Too bad Lucas didn't stop the retconning there. The way he reworked the whole mother's death part in order to do it his new stupid way in the prequel trilogy, that was really lame.
You won't get any argument from me there. I much prefer the backstory Leia revealed in Return of the Jedi - better than anything in the  prequel movies, yuck.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think Kylo Ren and Rey are related?
Well I think it's obvious that they have some sort of connection. Maybe they're brother and sister.
If they were, do you think that might soften Kylo's outlook a bit?
Not really... I mean look what he did to his own father!
You've got a good point there. I kind of feel like that symbolized the last of the good that was him leaving and him turning totally to the dark side.
I'm still wondering who this Snoke character actually is.
I heard a quote from the director that said he isn't any sort of sith or character we've seen before.
Is that so? Well that's a bit disappointing. I kind of liked the fan theory that said he might be Grand Moff Tarkin.
But didn't Moff get blown up with the death star?
I mean you never know man. In this universe, characters always some back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite planet in the Star Wars universe?
I would have to say Coruscant.
Why that one?
It just feels right, I love how it's this big bustling planet.
What do you mean?
Well from what we've seen in the movies it's this huge sci-fi city and I believe thats pretty much all we've seen of it.  I just love the fact that it's all busy and advanced.
That's a good point, you'd think with how advanced all these species are that most planets would be like that.
I agree I always thought it was odd when a planet felt like they were less advanced than we are.
I never thought about it but you make a good point.
That's why I liked it the most though some of the other planets were good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think I saw three versions of Return of the Jedi.
Really? What were they?
The first one was the original, released in 1983.
And the second?
There was a re-release in 1997, with a change of songs in the end.
Wow, I did not know that.
The last time I saw this there was one ther change.
Which was?
They replaced Ray Milland standing with Yoda and Obi-wan.
Right, they used the Anakin from Revenge of the Sith.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know much about the story throughout the Star Wars universe?
I really don't. I feel like it's too much to keep up with.
As a die-hard Star Wars fan, I completely understand that.
How are you able to keep up with everything?
The films just appeal to me. Nothing too specific.
You just like the movies overall?
Yeah, and it's been that way since I was a child.
Could you explain the story to me a bit?
I could, if it was simple enough to summarize 8 movies.
That's a lot of movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Ron Howard being the new director.
For what?
The Han Solo, solo film.
I did not know that. I think it is alright.
I wonder why JJ Abrams would not direct it?
I would say due to the fact it will be awful.
Why you say that?
It does not make sense.
Why not?
We already know what happens to him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your least favorite quote in the Star Wars movieverse?
Ha, so much to choose from.
I know, right? Lucas is NOT a writer.
Probably Anakin and Padma arguing about who loves the other one more. Obnoxious.
More than the "sand being irritating" because it gets everywhere?
Of course, because this is far darker.
How so?
Age difference?
Huh?
Their relationship would be a crime in modern-day Earth. She's a queen and he's 15. That's creepy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can remember watching the original three Star Wars in the 80's
I do too It was like an event.
The movies really blew my mind because they weren't like anything out there.
Yes, they marketed them so well.
The characters made the movie.
Oh I agree.
I wasn't too happy with the next three they tried to do.
Me either but now I feel hopeful about these newer movies.
I think there are endless possibilities for the stories to weave together.
Yes that's how I felt about Rogue One.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Star Wars movies. Would you also consider yourself a fan?
Absolutely and I love all of the movies. Do you have a favorite?
I would have to say Empire Strikes Back. I just think it was the best all around.
Empire is actually my second pick, next to Return of the Jedi.
Not a bad choice, but what makes Return of the Jedi number one in your eyes?
I think Jedi was just a great way to close the saga, we got to see the return of Anakin, and the acting was completely on par.
While I do not disagree, I just feel Empire Strikes Back gave the fans more of what they wanted. It had a little bit of everything.
I do not disagree with that one bit, but I just feel it's so popular because of the big "Father bombshell."
I suppose we can agree to disagree in a friendly way.
Of course. Despite our favorite being a little different, neither of us can disagree on the fact that Star Wars overall is an amazing film series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's with Leia's hair?
The double bun?
Yeah, so weird.
I don't know, but she was pretty hot.
Jaba thought so.
Ha.
Leia's my favorite heroine.
Mine too.
You wanna watch the trilogy again.
Absolutely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think of Attack of the Clones?
I'm a little so so on it.  What about you?
It was better than Episode I but still a bit behind the other movies.
Yeah, I know.  Count Dukoo was cool though.
Yeah, Christopher Lee plays a good bad guy.
It was awesome to see someone that was a Padiwan for Yoda himself.
It was, that was a great display of Jedi heritage.
I know, Yoda trained Dukoo, who trained Qui Con, who trained Obi Wan, who trained Anikan.
Obi Wan and Yoda also both trained Luke.
Yeah, but that breaks the chain a bit and was much later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are you such a big star wars fan?
i love the legecy and I think the story is fun
Which version of the story do you like
I loved the reboots, starting from episode one
Aren't those known as the worst ones
Honestly i like them better
why is that
because the special effect are better and the story moves faster
then i guess you aren't a fan of the empire strikes back era
no i like it, just not as much as the new stuff
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the deal with all the desert planet scenes in Star Wars?
What do you mean?
It seems like most of the movies had at least one desert scene
Well, not all of them, but yes there seemed to be a lot.
Luke Skywalker lived in Tatooine and they go back to rescue Han from Jabba
Maybe they like the remoteness of the desert planet
I guess. Maybe they like the way the light is filmed for production purposes
I think it helps show how remote Luke's background is
Yeah, that's a good point. Lonely life in the desert.
Yes, but helps provide perspective.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Anakin Skywalker's turn in Revenge of the Sith?
Yeah I mean we knew it was coming.
Excellent, I believe the same.
I think it was the best out of all the Star Wars so far.
I didnt think that far into it.
Samuel L Jackson had a campy role though
Most actors who arent into it have minor roles.
I didnt like his at all.
James Earl Jones did a great job with Vader
That is off topic, but I agree with you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would win a fight, Darth Maul or Yoda?
I think Yoda would win
Why do you say that?
He is 100 times more powerful than Darth Maul
Well Darth Maul has two lightsabers pretty much
But Yoda is the strongest Jedi to ever live and is very agile!
But Darth Maul is younger than Yoda
That doesn't matter, Yoda has enough of the Force to take down any evil thing
I'd like to see him try! Yoda is way too old!
Yoda will do flips all around Darth Maul and then cut him in half!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited to see the next Star Wars?
Very.
When is it coming out?
December 2017.
That's cool.  Will you stay up and see the first showing?
Probably not.  I'm worried about movie theater related shootings.
There's a new trailer out.
I like the island where they shot the scene with Rey and Luke.
Old Luke Skywalker looks good with a beard.
I agree.  I need to get me one of those robes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue One?
Yes, it was pretty good
Yeah, I saw it as well. I liked it.
What was your favorite part
The scene where Darth Vader goes ape sh*t against all those rebel scum
Yeah that was pretty cool
It was a good transition to the original Star Wars movie
What year did that one come out?
1977
Wow, it's been a long time
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of the new Star Wars movies?
They're okay, I've only seen one of the new ones.
Yeah, I feel the same lukewarm way.
It just isn't the same without George Lucas directing them.
Yes, and now everything is computer-generated, so it gives it a cheap and fake look.
I miss the miniatures and models they used on the first trilogy too.
Were you surprised that they killed off Han Solo?
Unfortunately I knew that outcome going in, as someone spoiled it for me online.
I hate when that happens because it ruins a good chunk of the story.
I still enjoyed the movie actually, but it definitely didn't shock me like it did to some other moviegoers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would change about the star wars movies of you could?
I would have put them out in chronological order.
Really? That would have ruined the reveal of darth vader as luke's father.
Yes that is a draw back but seems confusing to me them being made they were. what would you change?
I wish I could have been there to stop lucas from using CGi too much in the newer episode 1, 2,3,.
Ya, it was not as believable as the costumes for the storm troopers.
That was my major complaint of that series overall. he got too carried away with the cgi.
Agreed, so glad the newest ones seem to have realized his errors and improved on them,
Ya, the cgi they use now is tasteful and really amazing, for example carrie fischer young again at the end.
That was so believable, don't think they could have done that any better!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars villain?
That would be Darth Vader.
Why Darth Vader?
I think he did a great job at being a bad guy and I loved his loud breathing.
That was rather creepy.
I also like how he turned around in Return of the Jedi and saved Luke's life.
That as a pretty special moment.
It was and I felt bad when he died.
I did, too.
At least he was a good guy when he died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard a cool ending for the Return of the Jedi that was never used.
What ending was that?
I guess George Lucas toyed with the idea of having Luke go to the dark side.
Really?  Interesting.
Yeah.  Darth Vader would die and Luke would put on his helmet.
That would have been straight nasty!
He would then say 'Now I am Vader' and assume the position.
That would have been an easy cliffhanger to move forward.
They scrapped it at the end as they wanted a happier ending.
Darn.  I love that kind of stuff!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I like Episode 1
Really? A lot of people think that is the worst one
I like the plot, and I like the fact that the effect look better than the older films
What do you think about the acting
Jake Lloyd was a little bit annoying as Young Anakin, but the rest of the cast was really cool
Doesn't Jar Jar Binks annoy you?
Well, I could have done without him, as he added nothing to the story
What is your favorite of the older films then?
I like Empire Strikes Back
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did they build that base on Hoth?
Maybe it was an old empire outpost.
I doubt it. Maybe they mainly used natural caves.
That sounds very possible. They just brought a bunch of equipment to the existing caves.
It did seem a bit chaotic and disorganized there. Not like an true military base.
They probably couldn't have been there that long without being detected.
The Empire is always good at detecting things.
But not so good in finishing off the resistance.
True, they should have been able to crush them easily with the Jedi weakened.
But good always wins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Yoda your favorite character in The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes. He had a lot of depth and was quite entertaining.
That scene in the swamp was very memorable.
I loved that film cause I did not know what was gonna happen next.
Yes. Luke's journey was really cool.
What did you think of Han Solo's journey?
I thought it was good that he was being hunted.
I agree. That added a lot to the suspense.
I was sad when he got frozen.
Me too. That scene was very depressing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
But to include that development story would['ve taken the movie over 3 hours. Who knows, maybe they did have the footages, but decided to cut it.
I don't if that's true, but if they did cut it, they made a mistake.
or maybe they didn't have the footages
Then that's just poor planning.
Well, either way, we agree the character of Darth Maul cold've used more development.
Yes. definitely. And he was such an evil creature, it would've been delightful to see his torture, harsh treatment and how he become evil.
That would've been great
More fulfilling to watch and follow the story
yep. Like how he deevlops his telekinesis would've been a great back story
Yeah! That was so evil, i wanted to know that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a star wars fan?
I like it.
Have you seen any of the movies?
Yeah, I like Darth Vader.
He's scary
His story was sad
It was sad that he was tricked to turn to the dark side and sad about Padme
And that he almost died and wore the suit
Most people would have given up
He did have that going for him
XXXXXXXXXXX
When you first saw Star Wars, what did you think when  it showed Darth Vader was Luke's dad?
I kind of knew, his name means Father in German.
Well, that is a bit of a let down. Did you think they ever showed any other clues.
Well, when Obi was speaking on Ankain, to Luke, he sais Vader killed your father.
But, that would show they were two people, not the same.
He even greeted Vader, calling each other "Old Friend".
That should have warned people.
I think we were so caught up in all the action of the movie, no one put it together.
The way that Vader killed him always confused me.
Well, Obi Wan did say Jedi never die, not really.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your take on the new Star Wars trailer?
Quite eerie really.
How so?
It sure seems like they are signaling that Jedis will no longer be a part of the universe.
My guess is that Luke knows you have to be on the light and dark side in order to be efficient.
That's a solid guess.  He probably realizes that to survive, one needs to be of both minds.
The poster alludes to it as well.
How so?
Check out the red and blue lightsabers meeting and joining.  I think it's foreshadowing.
Interesting idea.  Maybe you're right1
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about episodes 1-3 of Star Wars?
I hated those movies, they were the worst.
I agree.
I think they have the worst characters, like Jar Jar Binks.
Jar Jar Binks was so annoying and he didn't do anything to help move the plot.
He was only there for comic relief and even then he was horrible.
I think R2-D2 was better at creating laughs.
The droid who doesn't talk gets the most laughs!
R2 was always so sassy.
We need him to make up for C3PO's stuffiness.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Did you see the last star wars movie that came out?
Are you talking about Rogue One?
Yeah that's the one.
Yeah I did.
Did  you like it?
Yeah I really did.
What did you like about it?
I thought it was a bit darker for a star wars movie and I enjoyed that tone of the film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me which star wars movie is your least favorite.
I did not like the second movie.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Why not though?
It was kind of boring to be honest.
You didn't like the acting?
The acting was not as good as the older ones.
I agree.
It was great speaking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The most iconic and worthwhile Star Wars films are the first three.
I agree. These worked well because of the way George Lucas adapted the philosopy of Joseph Campbell in the characters.
That's right. It especially works in Luke Skywalker's origin story in A New Hope.
Don't forget the characterization of Obi Wan as the wise man that Luke goes to for answers.
Of course. And what about the archetypical villian in the character of Darth Vader?
I think, though, that that really comes out in The Empire Strikes Back, when Darth Vader reveals himself as Luke's father.
Isn't that one of the greatest surprise endings in cineme? It blew me away when I first saw that.
Me too. But I have to say I have a partiality for The Return of the Jedi. It's so much fun.
I don't know if I agree. The tightest of the three is The Empire Strikes Back - interestingly the only one of them that Lucas didn't direct.
Wait. Did he direct The Return of the Jedi? Anyway, all things said, that trilogy sure is a classic of cinema.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, which Star Wars movie is the best, in your humble opinion?
For me, it'd have to be The Empire Strikes Back.
Yes, for me, that's the most emotionally resonant of the movies...
And also the darkest, with such a brutal, sad ending and cliffhanger.
Yeah, I can't imagine having to wait three years after Empire Strikes Back to find out what happened.
It had to feel like a bit of a letdown, Return of the Jedi.
You see such great characters we know very little about in Empire Strikes Back, like Boba Fett.
He's just so mysterious and cool, and it's definitely sad how he dies early on in Jedi.
Some people say that it was Lawrence Kasdan who really made Empire Strikes Back a great film.
Yes, I wonder if he is a better director than Lucas, or maybe better at executing Lucas' ideas and concepts?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you think Attack of the Clones was out of place?
In the timeline?
I just feel like it was a half hearted movie.
It was an improvement over The Phantom Menace.
Darth Tyranus was pretty cool
I guess you could say that but some of the plot was boring.
Could you see them maybe going back to those years and doing more.
No I think most of the characters are now too old to do that.
Yeah but visual effects can change that.
Plus I think the character of Darth Sidious would be ruined.
XXXXXXXXXXX
As insanely popular as the Star Wars movies are, episode one: The Phantom Menace was not a well received film. Why do you think that is?
Believe it or not, I don't think I have sat down and watched that entire movie. It just didn't really seem like that big of a must-see film to me.
I can see your point in that. I've seen it a couple of times and really don't think there is a ton going on.
I was never a huge fan of the idea of seeing such a young Anakin. I understood what they were going for, but it just didn't do much for me.
That being said, what kind of problems have you heard about that movie?
The big things I've heard that hurt the movie are the young actor who plays Anakin is said to have been very "wooden" and the CGI looks bad.
Those are both problems I've also heard and agree with. I also felt Qui-gon was killed pretty anti-climatically.
I have watched that clip of YouTube. The fight scene wasn't bad, but his death came out no where to me.
Agreed. I think long-time fans who have seen the original, maybe have known it was coming, but it still wasn't very strong.
And if memory serves, we never see him again. Not even in a vision or flashback.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Return of the Jedi.
It was awesome.  Great capstone to the original three movies.
Yeah, good fight at the end too.
And a good introductoin to the Emporor.  I mean a proper one anyway.
Yes, he'd be very important in the prequels.
Yeah, he was a good bad guy.
One of the best parts of the movie, was the escape from Jaba.
I also like the Ewoks.  They were pretty cool.
Yeah, they were cute.  But vicous in battle.
I agree, they took out loads of Emperial Troops.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies?
Yes i love movies
Which series is your favorite?
Star Wars
I love star wars too
They are great movies
My favorite is return of the jedi
Thats my favorite movie too
We have so much in common
I know
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you like Star Wars, right? Who is your favorite character?
You mean overall? It's so hard to choose, but I really like Leia
Leia is an awesome character, no doubt. I wonder how they'll handle her character now that Carrie Fisher has passed away.
I'm still really bummed about that, but I'm sure they'll figure something out for Leia in The Last Jedi.
Speaking of which, do you think Luke is going to turn to the dark side?
No, I think they're just trying to mislead people with that. But I'm still really looking forward to episode VIII.
Can you believe they're making an entirely new trilogy after the prequel movies were so controversial?
The prequels weren't that bad. Too much CGI, yes, but the stories and characters were solid
That's true. And I really hope Sam Jackson is right about Mace Windu still being alive!
And if he did survive, then maybe his kids will show up in one of the new movies! Maybe Finn is his grandson or something, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of the most silly topics of the Star Wars films is, who shot first: Han or Greedo.
I know! It is a little silly, but here we are years still, still talking about it.
That being said, I know we have both seen New Hope, many times. Do you have any thoughts on who shot first?
Call me crazy, but it actually looked like Greedo shot first! I would have to go back and watch, though.
I think you are right, honestly. I want to say the idea they were going for is they both shot at the same time, but perhaps Greedo missed?
It may have very well been a production error. I guess we will never know!
Or perhaps it was all part of George Lucas's master plan. Intentionally film it that way to keep the fans talking.
This is also a possibility that I have swung around over the years.
I remember reading the newer released version of the film, they added in a CGI head of Han Solo actually moving his neck to avoid the fire.
I heard that, too and I also heard it looks kind of silly and obviously fake.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Star Wars Series?
Ya I love them.
I do too now. I just binge watched the entire series and am blown away.
You had never seen them before?
No. I just seen the new one The Force Awakens.
What did you think of it?
I enjoyed it. It was weird to have so many new characters, but I also like that they brought back the old ones too, although there were a few disappointing moments.
Ya I don't want to give anything away to anyone listening.
Ya me either. I really like John Boyega in it.
Oh ya, me too. He is one of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what bugged me in The Force Awakens?
Is it something silly?
You tell me. It was Kanjiklub.
What's wrong with them?
It's the name. It sounds like kaiju club.
Like a club for Japanese monster fans?
Yes! And they were even after Han Solu due to unpaye debts.
So? What's that have to do with monsters?
He was smuggling literal monsters, rathtars, across the galaxy. It makes me think that Kanjiklub is an organization of black market monster dealers.
When you put it like that, it seriously does sound silly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello my friend
Yo
What is good
Nothing much
Same i am just watching some tv
What you watching
I am watching that cartoon based on starwars movies
Omg i love that show
It added so much to the clone wars
I so want a clone wars full feature movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Empire Strikes Back.  Again.
Why not?  It's the best one,
I can't stop getting freaked out every time I see Han in carbonite.
Yeah, it scared me when I was a kid.
Sure - he was frozen, and he had that grimace on his face.
Right?  He looked like he was in agony.
But I just realized when I was watching it tonight - when Han first goes into the hole, he's handcuffed.
Oh yeah!  Then he's holding up his hands!  Now how did that happen?
Did the carbonite break the handcuffs?  I have so many questions now!
Me too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which ship battle was your favorite out of all the Star Wars movies?
I thought that the battle in Return of The Jedi was really good. How about you?
Personally, and I know this is going to be a bit of an unpopular opinion. But I really liked the Rogue One ship battle.
Oh that's interesting. Why is that?
Well don't you remember how Admiral Raddus ordered them to ram those two star destroyers into each other?
Oh yeah I had forgotten about that. That was super cool.
I honestly think those last fifteen minutes were the absolute coolest parts of that movie. Hands down.
Yeah and when Vader comes in swinging at all those rebels. You can just feel the fear.
He straight up crushed that one dude up against the ceiling! Insanely awesome.
I don't know how I felt about the CG Leia though. A little gaudy, but I guess it worked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part about The Revenge Of The Sith?
Well I really liked the Wookie Battle on Kashyyyk. I just thought it was way too short.
You know one of the best parts about the original trilogy was that the fights lasted a good long time.
They just used up all their screen time on an Anakin Padme romance.
I really feel like that was a bit of a mistake.
Yeah, kind of made the movies less awesome. But the Anakin versus Obi Wan battle was very cool.
It's true. They seemed very evenly matched, but I feel like Anakin had a bit of an edge.
But Obi Wan seems to have the best luck in the galaxy! He always escapes sticky situations.
I hope that in upcoming movies if they have a battle, it's longer than 30 seconds. They definitely did really well with that in Rogue One.
Oh, Rogue One was freaking amazing! Disney hasn't let me down yet with any of their productions.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars spacecraft?
Definitely the X-Wing.
I prefer the Imperial Star Destroyers from the original movies.
The X-Wing is like a fighter jet in space, though.
Imperial Star Destroyers are like battleships. That's really cool.
They're more like aircraft carriers. They carry TIE Fighters.
That's true. But X-Wings kill TIE fighters so effortlessly one wonders why they bothered.
Imperial Star Destroyers are at least effective in the movies.
Their triangular shape looks cool, too.
X-Wings look sleek and pointed, like a fighter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the original Star Wars?
Yep, a New Hope, totally revolutionized the film industry.
Yeah, it's amazing that it's still relevant today.
I know what you mean.  Things are out of fashion in five minutes now.
But Star Wars holds up.  My daughter and I watched it together recently.
Oh yeah?  How did she like it?
She loved it.  Which is awesome, my dad shared with me, I shared with her.
Yeah, truly cross generational.
It's interesting to see that first movie and how everyone develops.
Especially Luke, so whiny in the first one but awesome by the third.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One thing that made fans angry about the prequels was the clone armor.
What was the problem with it?
In all the other movies, they have physical costumes.
Alright, go on.
But in the prequels, it's all entirely CGI.  No armor was built as it wasn't needed.
I've never noticed before to be honest with you.
It's completely true.  They didn't see the need since they weren't being staffed by actors
The first prequels relied a bit too heavy on special effects.
I would agree.  They were never quite to my liking.
Thankfully, it improved later on as fan criticism took its toll on the filmmakers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars
Yes i love those movies
Me too
My favorite is the force awakens
My too
Hans solo was great in it
He really was
And harrison ford was a great actor
He was
Loved the casting
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character from all of Star Wars?
Han Solo, for sure.
Not Luke Skywalker?
Nah, he's too whiny.  Like when he whines to Uncle Owen about getting converters in A New Hope.
Yeah, he was whiny.  My favorite character is Yoda.
Yoda?
Oh yeah.  He's so cute-- and pretty bad, considering his fight scene in Attack of the Clones.
Yeah, it was pretty awesome seeing him flip around.
Speaking of Attack of the Clones, what did you think about Boba Fett being a clone of Jango Fett?
I thought it was kinda lame, honestly.  Boba was one of my favorites, but I thought that backstory was weak.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the name Luke Skywalker?
Yes. It is a great name.
Is he your favorite character?
No. I like Yoda.
He is awesome.
I love when he meets Luke and is messing with R2-D2.
Did you like the puppet?
Yes. It was such a well made puppet. Frank Oz did a great voice for it.
It's too bad he was digital in the new one.
Yes. He looked way better as a puppet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, how do you weigh in on the Han shot first deal?
Eh, I don't really like talking about that stuff. Lucas kinda ruined a New Hope for me.
Why? because he changed it around?
it's not just turned around. Making Greedo shoot first took away a lot of Han's coolness.
Why does it matter so much? Doesn't it make him more of a good guy?
No! Han isn't a good guy in the first place. He's a scoundrel!
I didn't think it was that big a deal and I thought it was good to make him a little nicer.
You are killing me, nice? Han isn't nice. He's supposed to be a wild west cowboy type.
I don't know, his best friends are a princess, a dog man and a magic boy, how much of a tough guy should he really be?
I don't I can ever watch star wars with you again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Star Wars fan?
Sort of, I like the three that were released first.
Which one is your favorite?
That's easy, The Empire Strikes Back.
I agree, Luke finding out Darth Vader is his father is hard to beat.
Return of the Jedi runs a close second though.
Why do you say that?
I have always been a big fan of Jabba the Hut.
That's a rare one, you don't find too many Jabba fans out there.
True, I don't think I have ever met another Jabba fan myself.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the latest rumor for episode 9?
Is this is about the crazy fan theory quding Darth Sidious and Supreme Leader Snoke?
No, this is an even crazier rumor!
Oh really? Please, do tell!
The newest crazy theory is that Supreme Leader Snoke is actually Ezra from the Star Wars Rebels series.
Ezra? Isn't he pre-episode 4 and a good Jedi in training?
Well, the rumor goes that Ezra loses everyone by Empire and gets trapped in the Unknown Regions while being pursued by Thrawn. He gets corrupted by the dark side and becomes Snoke.
That's a pretty crazy theory. Do you have anything to back it up?
Nothing solid, just rumors on social media.
That's too bad. It's a pretty crazy idea to have Ezra turn dark and become Snoke.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite star wars character?
Mine is Luke Skywalker.
If you had to choose between being a jedi or part of the sith, which would you choose?
I'd be a jedi.
What do you think about the Star Wars Prequels?
They're not as bad as everyone says they are. Outside of some bad acting and writing decisions, they're alright.
What color lightsaber would you have?
I'd have purple, because it's my favorite color.
Do you think Darth Vader is entirely bad?
He did some incredibly bad things, but he also had terrible things happen to him. I don't think he's entirely bad, but he's definitely done things too horrible to forgive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Obewan Kenobi
Really?  He didn't do much
What do you mean?
I mean he's in one movie!
True... but he TRAINED Luke!
That is critical
Annnndd without him everything would have been lost
A critical character
exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the original Star Wars Movie?
The one with Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher?
Yes that one!  I think it's so much better then the new ones.
I remember the first time I saw star Wars I was so shocked to find out Luke was Darth Vadar's son.
I know!   That was a epic cliff hanger. I was like what?  But the new ones don't have that.
Exactly I remember waiting and waiting to find out if Darth Vadar  was lying or what was going on.  Then he cut his arm off!
Darth Vadar was evil and uncaring in the original movies. The new ones just don't have that element.
I have always admired the original movies and how they did the space craft using model toys.
I watched the special feature that showed that. All the space scenes were just a toy and a box with a backgroun. But somehow they look so much better then the new movies.
I think the new Star Wars movie are more CGI then anything and I can't stand Jar Jar Binks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite star wars character?
I still like Anakin.
Really?
Yeah, because he was so innocent but then lured to the dark side.
Yeah and plus he only went to the dark side to save Padme.
Very true.
My favorite character is Princess Leia.
I love that character too.
Carrie Fisher does a great job.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did yoda ever die?
Yeah, he did
do you remember how so?
he died at age 900 i think
so it was from old age?
yeah, just natural causes.
that is a long life
it really is.
yoda was the man
yes he was a wise leader
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
Personally I've always been a big fan of The Empire Strikes Back. That Hoth battle was really cool!
I think a lot of people also feel that way. I like Return of the Jedi myself.
Are you a huge fan of Ewoks?
I think they're so adorable. And I liked how they kicked some stormtrooper butt in that battle on Endor.
My other favorite part about The Empire Strikes back was the saber fight between Luke and Darth Vader. That was awesome.
It wasn't bad. The lightsaber combat is so hard to watch now that I've seen the flashier choreography in the prequels.
To me it will always be better, more real. I liked that The Force Awakens tried to kind of replicate that gritty feeling that the fights had.
It's almost like the prequels and the other movies aren't even in the same universe! They're so different.
That's true. But if we didn't have the prequels we'd have missed out on a lot of great characters. Like Qui Gon Jinn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Return of the Jedi?
Well yes and no!
Why the no?
Ewoks, even if they're soft and cuddly and benign, didn't belong in the movie.
Yeah everyone dumps on the Ewoks.
Plus some of the actors, I'm not saying who, phoned in their performances.
Wow. I'll see if I can spot this next time.
I think that this is the film in the trilogy that fans say they liked the least.
Maybe something about the story.
But at least Luke has a reunion of sorts with family.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are so many people into Star Wars?
I have no idea. But I really like the special effects.
I sold some vintage space craft on eBay. I think it was called the Millenium Falcon.
Really how much did you get?
I don't remember but it wasn't in pristine condition.
I think it's a shame about Princess Lea.
Oh my gosh, I heard she was on several really strong drugs.
When is the new episode due out?
I'm not quite sure, but I definately want to see it.
Me, too! I can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Supreme Leader Snoke?
I thought it was some weird CGI creep.
True enough, but I love that actor.
Who played him?
He was voiced by Andy Serkis?
Who's that?
Gollem from Lord of the Rings.
No way!
Yep. Such a good actor.
I'll have to watch it again Precious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch star wars?
Yes they are great movies
I really liked return of the jedi
That one was good
What one did you like
I liked the empire strikes back
That one was good too
They all are really
Thats true
Nice talking to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if Princess Leia is going to be in anymore Star Wars movies?
She has a part in eight, but not nine.
I wonder why not nine. They could put her in digitally.
I read where the president of LucusFilms doesn't want to do that.
It's weird. First we lose Han Solo and now Princess Leia.
I know.
I wonder if any other main characters wil not be in nine.
I hope Luke still is.
I do, too. He was one of my favorite characters.
I think lots of people still like him a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they will replace Carrie Fisher in the next Star Wars Movie?
I don't know who else could play Leia.  She passed so suddenly.
Yes, they may have to remove Leia from the plot in the upcoming film.
Perhaps they will kill off Leia in the next film, since Fisher is gone.
Perhaps.  Do you think they might bring back Han Solo?
He was killed in "The Force Awakens".
Yes, but is he really dead, or will there be a sci-fi "resurrection"?
I don't know, but I wouldn't mind seeing Harrison Ford in the film.
Me too, but Solo is the only character he could play.
Yes.  Perhaps he will after death like Yoda and Kenobi did at the end of "Return of the Jedi"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like star wars?
Hecks yah I do.
Do you prefer the originals or the newer ones.
While the cg is great for the new movies I like the originals. The story lines were awesome without the cg.
Which one is your favorite original?
Definitely empire.
Great choice. That's my favorite as well. Did you see it inn theaters back in the day?
I'm so old I saw it at the drive in.
That's awesome. What's your favorite new version.
Definitely the most recent. It was a prequel to the original.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Yoda, I love him.
Why do you like Yoda so much?
There are so many reasons, the way he looks and the way he talks are two of them.
I have never really liked Yoda.
Who do you like?
Chewbacca has to be my favorite.
I like Chewbacca, he is funny. I thought you would go with the standard Luke or Vader.
I tend to surprise people sometimes.
Just like George Lucas, you both have quite a creative mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about movies
Great
What do you like?
I like star wars
Me too
What is your favorite movie?
I like the empire strikes back
I love that one
Which one is your favorite
The force awakens
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Han Solo
Yeah, he was pretty bad ass
how about you?
I liked Darth Maul
Who?
The guy with the red and black face
Ummm...wasn't he in one for like 15 minutes
Yeah, but he was still pretty cool
Whatever dude
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know how they say behind every great man, there's a good woman?
Yes, of course I've heard it, and it's usually true!
In the case of George Lucas, when he was making the first Star Wars, it was very true. His wife was a very talented film editor.
She worked on his film for him? Probably for free?
They had so little money to do the film with, they could only do a couple shots of each scene. She spent long hours late into the night pulling it all together.
He was very lucky to have her.
It took her eight weeks to make the Death Star space battle.
It's that kind of dedication to doing something that leads to success.
Unfortunately, Marcia and George divorced in 1983, and he later married a younger business woman in 2013.
That's one of the things missing from the good old days before the sixties, people don't stay married to the same person forever anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best scene in the Empire Strikes Back?
The Luke and Vader fight.
You mean the part when Vader reveals who he really is?
Yes. That part was very cool.
I was not expecting that.
I don't think anyone was.
Did you think the fight was choreographed well?
Yes. It was one of the best fights in film history.
I love the beginning with the snow monster.
Yes. That was really scary.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Star Wars movies was Chewbacca in?
Five
Which ones?
The original 3 and then episodes 3 and 7.
I do not remember him in Episode 3
He was in it on the Wookie home planet.
Oh yeah. Now, I remember
He met Yoda.
That was sort of weird.
Yes. I prefer the Chewbacca from the first 3 original movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this is so sad
What is sad
That they turned this into a kids movie
What
Star wars
How is it a kids movie
episode 7 is so kid friendly it is sad
It is fine
It is far from fine
What makes you say that
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched some of the old Star Wars films, ever seen them?
You know I have, which was your favorite?
I thought the first one, well A new Hope was best.
That one really showed a lot of heart, a coming of age.
I like the way Luke went from this more or less farm boy, to something much more.
Something powerful, a real force, actually the force.
I liked the way the showed his family too, his aunt and uncle.
Until they were killed by the bad guys.
Yes, but it was a good glimpse into how he was raised and what he went on to be.
Such a change for a kid from a sand planet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a confession to make.
What's on your mind?
My absolute favorite thing about the Star Wars films are the machines.
You mean like the robots?
Pretty much, yeah. I love the AT AT walkers for absolutely no reason at all.
That's actually kind of funny. Don't get me wrong, I like them too.
But don't you like the actual characters a lot more?
Don't beat yourself up over it. You like what you like.
Well, thanks for being considerate.
No problem! How about we go watch The Empire Strikes Back?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like The Emperor Strikes Back.
Oh, that's a classic!
I like all the classics, but that's my favorite one.
Do you like any of the modern ones?
I like Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, despite what the reviewers said.
I like that movie too! It's very campy.
Campiness in Star Wars movies is underrated.
Who is your favorite character?
I would say, Luke Skywalker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Star Wars film will ever have Yoda again?
I do not think so.
I hope they at least give him more of a back story.
It would be very cool if he got his own movie.
The movies do not even show what he is.
You mean what type of alien?
Right, they say what Chewie is and so on.
I love the big world in the movies.
All the different types of people and creatures.
I think that is what makes the movies so good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the next Star Wars movie?
A ton! It's so nice that they come out one a year now.
What are you looking forward to?
Well, we didn't get to see much of Luke in the last one. I'm hoping for more of him.
I really like Mark Hamill. I wish he was in more things.
He's always cast as the villain when he acts elsewhere. I'm excited to have him as a hero again!
But are we sure that Luke's a hero still?
He must be. He's Luke Skywalker.
Yeah. I guess that could never really change.
It definitely couldn't!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think George Lucas should have left the line alone in A New Hope for the special edition?
I personally do think he should have left it.
I agree, it fundamentally changes the character.
It kid of does, when Han shoots first it shows he is willing to kill before he gives someone the chance to kill him.
Yeah, by changing it to Greedo shooting first it made what Han did a 'defensive' act.
I rather liked it the way it was, I think Han would shoot Greedo outright if he thought his life was in danger.
Right? Now in the special editions he is a 'good guy' who doesn't shoot until the other person does.
I still think of Han as the original version, I don't like the soft Han that George made in the special editions.
Maybe they should make a 'ultimate edition' where they fix all the little things that George messed up by messing with the films too much.
True, it could also be a good opportunity to remaster some of the effects and other scenes with mistakes as long as they don't fundamentally change the content.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think the worst star war movie his
I think it has to be the phantom menace unfortunately
why do think its the worst one
the plot was so boring. it was hard to follow why we should care about intergalactic politics
I thought it was pretty boring too. the action had too much fan service.
like all of the gratuitous light saber fighting
It felt really long too
yes, and the acting wasn't great
natalie portman did a good job
I think her performance was adequate, but the rest was pretty forgettable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite new Star Wars Movie?
I like Rouge One better than Force Awakens
Why is that?
Rouge One feels more like the original Star Wars
Do you like the original Star Wars the best?
Yes I do it the best movie of all time
When did it come out
1977 and it didn't feel like a blockbuster
Really why?
It felt more like a independent movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Skywalker be a big part in Episode VIII
I think so.
I hope so!
He is looking a bit rough these days.
He's gotta be like sixty.
I just haven't seen him in so long.
He's been around.
Doing what.
Voice over work primarily.
Like I said, I haven't SEEN him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about how the Star Wars movies portrayed Anakin's transformation to Darth Vader?
It was done well I think. He went from an innocent little boy in 'Phantom Menace" to a full-fledged Sith in "Revenge of the Sith."
Yeah, I think the movies did a good job showing how Senator Palpatine manipulated him as well.
Yeah, that actor did a good job. He gave off such a creepy vibe.
And while I wasn't a huge fan of Hayden Christiansen as Anakin, he did an alright job and I enjoyed the movies he was in.
Ewan McGregor really stole the show though, right?
Yes! He was so awesome as Obi Wan! I don't think they could have picked a better actor for that role.
I agree, and I really thought he added a new depth and layer to the whole Obi Wan and Anakin relationship.
Yeah, such a tragic storyline.
Yeah, but at least Anakin found his way again before he died in "Return of the Jedi."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about star wars
Sounds great to me
I love the galaxy that they are set in
Me too
There is so much action and adventure in these
There really is
And just the right amount of romance
Exactly
Best movies ever
I think so
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Han Solo?
Yes. He was in those STAR WARS movies.
I think he was in 3 or more of them.
I think so also. He was like a bad cowboy.
Yes. It was like he was always on the run.
When he shot Greedo I beat he wanted to get off that planet quick.
Yeah, he owned all that money.
Then he met Ben Kenobi and Luke.
That was just more trouble.
But it all worked out when they got the plans to the base.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it true that Gary Kurtz left after Empire?
Yes, he did not want to do another attack on the death star movie and him and Lucas left each other
That is interesting.
Yeah. He wanted Luke to ride off into the sunset at the end too.
That would have been cooler
I agree
I did not like the Ewoks.
They were okay, but they did not belong in Star Wars
Do you think Gary Kurtz left cause of them too?
Maybe. That seems like it would be one of the reasons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
Return of the Jedi.
Really? I liked Empire Strikes Back more.
Return of the Jedi is the conclusion to the original trilogy, though.
It takes a lot of missteps with its plot, though. Like with ewoks.
But it has Jabba's Palace, which is a great sequence.
Empire Strikes Back has the scenes on Hoth, which were better.
Return of the Jedi has more emotional depth - especially in the ending duel.
Luke duels Vader in Empire Strikes Back, too.
But Return of the Jedi proves to be Darth Vader's salvation. That's why I like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw The Empire Strikes Back.
Wasn't there another director than Lucas for that?
Irvin Kershner.
Right.  Who plays Yoda?.
Frank Oz.
Is it in this movie that Han and Leia get attracted?
Yes, they kiss in the asteroid scene.
Doesn't Luke lose his hand?
Yes, he gets a prosthetic one in the end.
I saw this movie as a filler before the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The Force Awakens yet?
Yeah I loved that movie!
Me too!  Who was your favorite character?
I loved Finn, he was pretty funny and I kind of want him and Rey to be a couple.
He does seem pretty protective of her and is very worried about her. I loved Po.
Po was great!  I was so excited when we found out that he didn't actually die in the crash.
Me too, I hope he sticks around for a while in the next one.
I also really loved Kylo Ren.  He was kind of corny but I also loved it.
I think I am most excited to see where his story line goes. Especially since he is Han and Leia's kid.
I know!  I am also hoping they will say who Rey's parents are or where she came from.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie?
Not really, I quit watching after the Phantom Menace.
You mean you haven't seen the new one?
Nope.
You have to see it man! It was so much better than the Phantom Menace!
Maybe I'll check it out. What was it called again?
The Force Awakens.
Hmm, I'll have to check it out.
You should, there is another one coming out in December, I can't wait.
Well if I like the Force Awakens, I'll go see it with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of attack of the clones?
I thought it was ok, better than Phantom Menace but still near the bottom of the list.
Yeah, the only real highlights were count Dukoo and Yoda fighting it out.
That's not entirely fair.  Samuel L Jackson had a good fight scene.
I guess you're right.  Seeing all those Jedi in a major battle was different as well.
Let's just try to forget the I hate sand comment.
Agreed, I try to remember it more for the beginning of the emergence of Darth Vader.
Like when he took out all those sand people.
And threw a bit of a fit saying he should decide who wins and dies.
I almost forgot the relationship between him and Obi Wan, that was pretty good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Definitely Jar Jar Binks
What?
You heard me.
He's the most god-awful character there is and is just a massive racial stereotype. What good can you see in him?
He's a sith lord.
Oh no, you're not buying into that theory, are you?
Of course I am, why wouldn't I?
Because you're smarter than that. What's the evidence?
He's like Palpatine: appears helpless but is actually in control. He wiped out half a droid army with "goofiness"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Will Star Wars survive passed the 9th episode?
Sure why wouldnt it?
There are no plans for anything beyond that.
I mean even if they dont they still could do spin offs.
Like Rogue One?
Yeah side stories they explain
I think that would be tough to follow
Not really, they always do a good job explaining things
Plus we have the internet for stuff we missed!
Yeah Star Wars is just fine the way it is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Star Wars Movie?
I haven't gotten the chance to see it yet.
You should definitely see it soon. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford are great in it.
What is the new one called?
It is called Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
I will definitely make sure to check it out.
This movie gave me hope for the new era of Star Wars movies.
I know, I wasn't sure they would ever be as good as the originals.
Same here but I really enjoyed this one and would love to see it again.
Let's watch it together sometime!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the star wars movies
I havent seen them
You should
Are they that good?
Yes they are
Should i start from the beginning?
Yes or you will miss alot
Okay i will do that then
I hope you like them
Thank you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think Snoke is?
You mean the theory that he's already a known character?
Yup. I heard some good ones.
Probably Plageius.
How so? He's dead.
So Palpatine thinks. Or, so he WANTS us to think.
Maybe they're in cahoots? And he'll take over with Palpatine dead?
Maybe. I have a good idea.
Who do YOU think Snoke is?
He's a guy named Snoke. He's just old and wise and powerful. he can easily hide.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man the end of Empire is pretty intense
How so?
Well there's the scene where they start torturing Han Solo
Oh yeah, he starts screaming off camera
Right, and then they freeze him in the carbon freezing
Yeah, that was pretty emotional
Yeah, Leia finally shows his love for him.
And then Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father
Yes, he wasn't happy about that
No, especially after he cut off his hand.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the original Star Wars trilogy vs. the new ones?
I much prefer the original trilogy.
I do too. They were a defining set of films for my younger days.
I thought the second three films were just awful, story-wise. The casting wasn't much better.
Yeah, I think Jar-Jar Binks should haunt George Lucas for eternity. What a gawdawful stepin fetchit character.
And how did you like the way a bunch of those bad guy aliens talked like imperialist Chinese leaders? How embarrassing.
And the dude they cast as Anakin, hoo, what an awful actor. How can you get into a story when you're cringing at the lead guy?
I absolutely hated, HATED the end of the trilogy, with Luke's mother just...dying for no reason at all, and retconning the whole first trilogy, and not in a good way either.
I totally agree. The first trilogy had mythic themes, noble characters, lots of emotion, beautiful themes, and a satisfying conclusion.
I would much rather watch the first three films and just forget the next three even existed. Except for Ewan MacGregor, he's the only one who came out of that mess with a little dignity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like the old movies the best.
I like them as well though the new ones are good too.
They're good but seem quite different from the old ones to me.
I think the new villain looks like a Darth Vader rip-off kind of thing.
With how he looks I wonder if he's Darth Vaders son.
I dont remember if they covered it.
I don't remember either, I like BB8.
So do I he's quite cute rolling around.
I wonder if hes a lot of peoples favorite character.
He probably is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, Daniel Craig played a storm trooper in The Force Awakens?
I know, and it was a huge waste.
What? Why?
Because you have 007 on set and you cover his face in plastic armor? Please.
What would you suggest they do?
I don't know, put a ton of makeup on him? Make him into an alien?
How is that any better?
You'd still know it's him; just a distorted version. As a stormtrooper, you'd never know without being told.
Oh, I see. Like, a little 'blink and you miss it' easter egg sort of deal?
Something like that, yeah. At least let us know he was there without having to look at IMDB.

Forest Whitaker was so good in Star Wars.
He wasn't in it!
Oh, I meant Rogue One.
Oh, Yeah! As Saw Gerrera
He is such an excellent actor.
You know the first movie I saw him in?
Which one.
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.
Now that takes me back!
It was on TV the other day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite Star Wars movie?
To me the original Star Wars was the best. You?
I loved Return of the jedi. So many of the films are great though.
Is that the one with ewoks?
Yes it is . They are so cute. I love all the scenes with them featured.
They are cute. I feel no other star wars movie has that aspect in them.
Well I think they tried to do another cute funny character with Jar Jar Binks but that flopped.
Ya what a failure on that character. He was so annoying. What were they thinking?
George Lucas probably wanted some kind of comic relief just not well realized.
Certainly wasn't. I do enjoy the majority of the other Star Wars characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is to blame for Anakin's fall?  Qui-Gon or the Emperor?
That's an interesting question.  I think it's a bunch of factors together.
If you had to choose between the two options though?
I think the Emperor then.  Because Qui-Gon saw the potential and good in Anakin, which was still a path for him when they met.
I guess if it weren't for the Emperor, Anakin's potential for evil would not have been met.
If anything though, wouldn't the Tuskan Raiders who killed Anakin's mother have more blame?
Definitely more than Qui-Gon.  What about Padma you think?
Well, I don't think she chose to die.  You can't blame characters for falling in love.
I guess that's a good point.  Lots of different factors led to Anakin's demise.
It's definitely sad that it happened, but it led to Darth Vader, the coolest sci-fi villain of all time.

Hello
Hi man
Whatcha doing
Reading up some stuff
On the new stars wars film coming ou
What one
The Han solo film
Sounds fun
It will be amazing been waiting years for this
Hope its good
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does The Last Jedi come out anyway?
I think around Christmas time. Lots of people go to the movies during the holiday season.
It's kind of sad that Han Solo is gone. I just got used to him as a character again and then boom, he's dead.
I hope Ben aka Kylo Ren gets what he deserves.
I bet Luke serves up some serious payback in this one.
Do you think Luke still has what it takes? He looked a little rough in The Force Awakens.
He has to. Han was his boy. You can't let Kylo get away with killing your best friend.
And it was patricide also. Man that was dark.
Do you think Finn and Rey are going to get together?
Actually I do. Star Wars needs a new love affair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happens at the beginning of Star Wars?
The original?
Yes
The two robots walk around in the desert and Darth Vader is introduced
Cool. Who are the robots?
R2-D2 and C-3P0
Are they friends?
They are good friends
Is it like the new one?
Not at all. They are very different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like the clone troopers
yes they are like my favorite
do you ever wonder what their armor is for
i know right the armor looks cool but it does not seem to protect them from much
its kind of sad that they seemed to be nothing more then slaves
i dont know if you could call them slaves more like a product
but since they are living thinking bieings how can we just say they are a product
well since they was created in a lab its not much different then producing alot of other products
i wonder what happen to them after the clone wars
ive been wondering about that as well because in the force awakens they are no longer any clones around
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part of The Force Awakens?
I love it when Han Solo and Chewbaka show up. I saw A New Hope decades ago when I was a kid, and seeing them again in a Star Wars film brought up great memories.
Yeah, that was great. But then it must have been quite a shock when Solo gets it.
It sure was. I didn't hear any spoilers and didn't see it coming. I couldn't believe it.
Rey is a great new heroine though, and a great Jedi trainee.
Yes, her character was handled well. Other than seeing Solo and Chewbaka, my favorite part was when she finds Luke Skywalker and delivers his light saber.
Right, he's only in the film for a few seconds but his presence has a terrific impact.
That's for sure. And Mark Hamill is excellent. He fits right into the role as if he's never left.
I agree. There's a lot to look forward to in the sequel.
I can hardly wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you see Finn fitting into the next few movies?
I'm not quite sure.  He's not the focal point for sure.
Agreed, that would definitely seem to be Rey.
I see him as being more of the Han Solo variety focused on phasers and one-liners.
I don't think they are trying to make him anything like Solo personality-wise, but get what you mean.
Maybe we'll learn a bit more of where he came from.  Did he grow up on the Death Star?
That's my guess. They probably just take kids and put them into training for the dark side.
I'm wondering if he'll ever be involved romantically with Rey.
I hope not.  No reason to muddy the plot with anything like that.
I agree with you, I just hope the writers do too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of this new line that Luke, in the next Star Wars, is over the whole Jedi thing.
I think it means he means to bring balance.
But, is that not something to show he is going to become a bad guy?
No, the whole premise is a balance. Dark and light, Jedi, Sith, he wants it to be equal.
Would that be equal, in the movie, killing off Jedi.
Well, according to Darth Plague, if one is gone maybe they both will be, that goes into a real grey area.
There is no grey area with jedi, is there?
There is not supposed to be, but look at the way they loved post Anakin.
The whole order went into hiding, you would think that would be grey.
It was, hence them all dying awful deaths in the movies, well most.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was the original Star Wars called A New Hope?
Not at first, but later on yes.
You mean he added it after he released it?
Yes. It originally was just Star Wars
I prefer that actually
Many people do
When did he rename it?
I think before the second one came out. But, I'm not sure.
I wonder if there are many other things he changed.
Oh, where do I start?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the original Star Wars movies?
Yes, my favorite is Empire Strikes Back!
I love that one!  Okay, so who's your favorite character?  Mine was Luke when I was younger but now is Han.
My favorite is actually Obi Wan Kenobi!  I think he is so intense.  I wish he had lived longer.
Oh me too! I hated when he died.  You know, the new movies are just not as good as those old ones.
I totally agree.  I think that that one with Jar Jar Binks was really weird.
Yeah, I do too. It was hard for me to see young Anakin and Luke and Leia's mom getting together.
I know what you mean.  They just didn't match.  It seemed like she was a better fit for Obi Wan.
I thought so too!  They would have made a great couple!
The movie could have went in a whole new direction. Who knows, It may have even been better!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch The Clone Wars?
Was that the cartoon?
Yes it was
No I did not watch that
Yeah it was weird to see  the movie in cartoon shape
I dont think it mattered that much to the storyline right?
No it didnt have any bearing.
If it did I would have watched it
I think the point of the film was to appeal to a younger audience
Yeah that does not make much sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the end of the STAR WARS original movie.
Like when they were trying to destroy the DEATH STAR?
Yes, that's it. It was intense.
It was crazy with all the space ships flying all around.
And they would get shot and burn up.
Darth Vader's space ship looked different.
Yeah, it looked mean like him.
And then Luke used the FORCE!
I don't think he could have shot into that hole without the FORCE.
Bye, bye DEATH STAR.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They're making a Han Solo movie?
What?!
Yeah, it's another one of those "A Star Wars Story" movies.
That is so cool! Will Ford be in it.
No. Its set in the past. They're getting a young guy.
He'd better not foul it up.
You can say that again!
Who are they getting?
Alden Ehrenreich.
Never heard of him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best lightsaber battle of the whole Star Wars franchise?
As much as I disliked 'Phantom Menace,' I loved the battle where Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face off against Darth Maul
That was such a great sequence.  And so fast-paced too.
It was the first time any of us ever saw a lightsaber battle that intense.
It made the original trilogy's lightsaber duels seem tame in comparison.  Very high-octane.
Ray Park was so good as Darth Maul.
He almost had zero dialogue, but was still so scary.
Did you know that Ray Park did his own stunts?
I didn't.  That's very impressive.
Yea, in real life Ray is an expert martial artist.  He brought a lot to his role as Maul.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movies out of the prequel trilogy?
It is definitely Revenge of the Sith!
I think that was the only good movie in the sequel trilogy!
It is! Definitely better than the previous two.
What was your favorite scene?
It was when Obi Wan Kenobi was yelling at Anakin Skywalker when he was near the lava.
That scene was so emotional!
I know, it made me tear up a little.
Obi Wan Kenobi sounded so heart broken.
It was hard to watch but so worth it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite part in Return of the Jedi?
I liked the scenes with Darth Sidious.
Those were good.
Did you know they had a different actor play the part in Empire?
Oh really?
Yes, but it was changed twice. Once to the guy from Return of the Jedi.
What did the original emperor look like?
He had a strange eye and a different voice.
Very cool.
Yes, you should check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequels?
Ewan McGregor? He's a good actor but he's no Alec Guiness.
I love Alec Guiness!  Have you seen him in The Detective, as Father Brown?
Yes!  That's a great film.  I agree, he's great at Obi-Wan.
I don't think McGregor did a bad job, though.  He is a really good actor.
But, he didn't add the element of humor that Alec Guiness does.
I know what you mean. Like in a New Hope when he says, Obi-Wan isn't dead because I am Obi-Wan.
I have a theory that Rey is his grand daughter.
That would be a lot better than the predictable answer of her being Luke or Leia's child.
Well, the Skywalkers do like to abandon their children, so who knows!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who in the Star Wars (Expanded Universe) series, was your favorite villain?
I have many favorite villains I look up to, but if I have to choose one— than I must say it's got to be Supreme Leader Snoke.
Snoke is hard to beat I admit, but I believe Darth Vader tops him by a mile. How about your favorite hero or heroine in the Star Wars EU franchise?
That's a tough call, but I have a soft spot for Jin Erso in Rogue One. She was a real heroine who gave her life for the greater cause. How about you?
That first name that pops into my mind is Yoda, of course. He has been through it all within the Star Wars Franchise. I secretly hope to see him as a Force Ghost in the upcoming movies.
Did you know that Ren in the Force Awakens heard Yoda's voice speaking to her in her Force Dream? Do you think that has any significance in the next movie?
I hope so, as a Force Awakens fan, it would be something I'd love to see in the movie. Most of all I want to see how Kylo Ren and Rey are related. IF they truly are.
I think they are, they have to be. Cousins at least. Can you imagine the battle between them if Ren were a Skywalker and Kylo as a Solo? Who would win?
Kylo has Snokes power behind him, then again, Rens potential has not been challenged yet. Only have to wait and see what Luke's training will afford her. I also hope to see Finn make a grand return in The Last Jedi.
He will, though I don't know in what way they will portray him after receiving such a grave injury by Kylo near the end of Force Awakens. We just have to wait and see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars Character.
I like R2D2.
He deserves plenty of credit.
The whole plot is around him and C3PO
Until the prequals, I never knew he could fly.
I wonder why he didn't talk normally.
He could do everything else.
If he did talk, he would be a fun person to be around.
He might play pranks
It's good that he found C3PO
XXXXXXXXXXX
Luke Skywalker or Han Solo?
If you asked me this question when I was 11 than Luke. If now Han Solo.
Really?Why the change?
Luke at 11 years old because I could relate to the innocence,now Han as an adult because of his defiance against the system.
Same with me. Luke is really the pefect hero for children,while Han is a hero for adults.
This is why Star Wars is so popular because many different age ranges can relate.
Luke is so pure and good at the beginning that most children can relate to him.
Yeah,sort of like a Peter Pan in away,while Han is more the scoundrel.
Han is like this rebel who is trying to do anything he can to get ahead.
That is why Han is relatable for most adults and usually becomes the adult's favorite character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite star wars movie?
I like the Phantom Menace the best
Yes, Darth Maul was really cool.
I love Jar-Jar Binks
Jar-Jar Binks is perhaps the best character in the Star Wars Universe
I love how clumsy he is when attempting to do the most normal things.
My favorite thing is the way that he talks when he says things like "Meesa"
Me too! Man, Jar-Jar is the best
I also like the introduction of Senator Palpatine
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
XXXXXXXXXXX
how did you feel about rogue one?
it messed me up!
i know, same here!
i guess i went in knowing everyone might die, but...
i don't know. i was expecting at least one person to live!
i was HOPING! at least the droid
they couldn't even give us that one thing?
i guess it was a suicide mission
i still wasn't prepared
i'm not sure i ever will be!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever get to see the Star Wars movie Rogue One?
Yes I did.
What did you think of it?
Well, all the Star War movies are great, but this one wasn't at all what I had expected.
I know.  It was kind of cool seeing how the Death Star was created.
But who would have thought the creator of the Death Star really didn't want to do it.
I really like how they bring in strong female characters into the story line.
I loved Jyn's character, and how she was willing to do everything in her power to prove her father was a good man, and had made a way to destroy the Death Star.
I also loved the way they tied it to Princess Leia.
Did you know that the day we went to see it was the day Carrie Fisher passed away?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you like star wars?
Yes i love star wars
My favorite movies
They are all done so well
I agree
And the characters are great
Tge the plots are great on all of them
I love the plots
Overall great movies
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite actress from the Star Wars movies?
It's a tough choice between Padme and Rey
Who was a better fighter?
I think Rey was by far
Do you think she will get better at fighting in the newest movie?
Oh yeah, she's just starting to learn how to fight
She has a lot to learn from Luke Skywalker
Yeah, I wonder if he will die in this next movie
That will be so sad, he is getting old though
The movie is called the Last Jedi so it makes me wonder if he will die
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello
Hi there.
Did you hear they are making a new Han Solo movie?
Yeah I did hear that.
Sounds pretty neat.
Yeah, but I don't know too much about it.
I don't know too much either.  I know Woody Harleson is going to be in it.
Really, that's an interesting choice.
Yeah, but I think he'll be great.
Guess we will find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Oh you gotta go with Darth Vader!
Rooting for the dark side, eh?
Someone's gotta!
What do you mean?
Everyone Wants to have Luke's babies!
Yea, I do see a lot of Luke fans!
Why do you ask?
NO reason really
Ah, cool cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new preview for the next Star Wars movie?
No I have not yet. Where did you see it?
I saw it when I went to the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie
Oh really, I must have missed it. Was it good?
Yeah! I am really excited for the next movie!
I am too! Did it say when it was coming out?
I believe it said December
I am so excited! I cant wait to see Luke again!
I know! He will diffidently be in it! he was in the preview
I am so excited! We will have to go!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what else is weird?
Here we go again
Why does Darth Vader have to wear a mask? He was only burned
What?!?!?!
He was only burned by the lava. No burn victims have to live with masks. The real reason he has a mask is because th voice of what's his name had to be used.
James Earl Jones. You think of the weirdest things.
But it bothers me.
Well, whatever the reason. Darth Vader has a mask.
But for a wrong reason. That's not right.
Well it's dramatic, and it looks cool. And makes that cool breathing noise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Well, I think of it as profit sharing.
Well, the movies are made by a bunch of staff also. What about them?
They get paid upfront, at least, as far as I know.
Well, they should also get paid a share of the profits as the revenue grows.
That's not how their guild is organized, I don't think. Besides, a lot of them are happy with the arrangements
They're stupid. What their union, or guild, or whatever need to negotiate a mandatory percent profit sharing with the movie makers.
There's not a movie maker who will agree with that i don't think. let alone the "George Lucas" Though he's made ton of money off Star Wars. Total over all the films in the series they made over 7.5 billion and it's growing everyday
That's a ridiculous amount of money off just one series, rehashing the same story over and over.
Oh no you didn't. The series is an epic retelling of good vs evil, not merely rehashing of the same story.
Yes, but the motifs are the same in all the trilogies. The original was good guy revealed, bad guy loses, bad guy strikes back, and good guy wins. That's the same way with the prequels, sequels and the anthology. It's just the same thing over and over. 16 films total about the same thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think about Rogue One?
I thought it was well made. It also ties in nicely to the series.
Yeah it explained what happened in between the third and fourth movie.
Yeah I always wondered how they knew the weak point of the death star.
Did you like the Force Awakens?
No not really. I thought it was too cheesy and nostalgic.
Yeah they tried to incorporate too many of the old characters and had too many allusions.
Yeah the flashbacks of Han, Chewy, and Leigh were questionable.
I like the fact that they're releasing a movie every year and I can't wait to see the new one in December.
Yeah I'm really interested to see who the new Jedi's are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any theories on who Supreme Leader Snoke actually is in the new 'Star Wars' trilogy?
I have no clue.  Weren't there rumors about it being Jar Jar Binks?
I think those were more jokes than actual rumors.
That's a relief to hear.  What are some of the main theories?
Well there is one that Snoke is actually Darth Plagueis.
Wasn't that the name of the Emperor's master, mentioned in the prequel series?
Yes it was.
But how would Darth Plagueis have survived if Palpatine said he was killed?
That's a good point.  It is just a rumor I heard.
Well, I like that rumor way more than the Jar Jar Binks one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you feel about the force awakens?
To be honest I freaked out because it was so good!
How did you feel about the characters.
I really enjoyed Finn's character and Ray.
Yes! They fit well together.
And the action scenes with them kept me on the edge.
I was so shocked that Ray had the force.
I was as well. But even more shocked that she was stronger than Kylo.
And Kylo's light saber was so awesome looking!
That light saber battle at the end was so epic as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like any of the prequels?
I liked them all.
Over the originals?!
Of cours not.
Good. I thought I'd have to unfreind you!
I just thought the prequels didn't get the credit they deserved.
The critics were pretty rough.
Not as rough as the fans!
Don't mess with a geek's universe.
You said it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite bad guy in the Star Wars movies?
Boba Fett, like there any other choice.
I would have to agree. What he lacks in screen time, he makes up for in awesome.
I never understood why they limited his on screen time so much.
I didn't either. You would think they would have really utilized this guy.
And the way he got killed, come on. That was just sad, lack of any vision.
Yeah, that was a terrible way to kill off someone so popular.
It would be like if Han Solo just ran into a asteroid and no one said anything else about it.
Well, probably not quite that bad, but I do get your point.
Yeah, that was a little over board.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Be honest, were you pulling for Anakin even though you knew how he would end up?
Oh for sure, who couldn't pull for a kid?
I know. He just becomes so evil.
Well yes, he does, but he is still important.
I know, I know, you have to evil in a movie about good and evil.
Well yes, but he is important because he Luke and Leia's dad.
Well I guess if that never happened the whole story would be very different.
True. But he comes around in the end.
I love that scene. I just wish they had more time together.
I know, I think there is a lot that he could have learned from him. At least who is mother was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Are you interested in Star Wars?
Yeah I like it okay.
Do you have any kids?  Do they like it.
Yes I have a boy that's 7.  He's just now getting into them.
That's great.  That's about the age I started getting into them.
Boys sure do seem to love these movies.
I know quite a few girls that like them as well.
Really?  Interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, whose your favorite Jedi character.
I'd have to say Mace Windu.
Really, nay particular reasons?
Well, first he is a badass character, tough and battle ready.
Basically, a tough guy's kind of Jedi, any other reason's
Well, he also is the only Jedi Master able to go toe to toe with Palpatine and survive.
Well, until Anakin turns on him and slices his arm off.
Yeah, but Palpatine couldn't defeat him by himself, he needed Anakin to distract and injure him.
Really, you don't think he was faking weakness to force Anakin to his side?
Would you take that chance with a comabt as skilled and determined as Mace WIndu?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars original trilogy soundtracks. Which is your favorite?
Oh man, that is such a hard question. I loved all three.
Me too. John Williams is one of my favorite movie composers.
I think it's more like, I have certain musical pieces in each film that are my favorites.
I love the jawa theme from the first film. The oboe melody is just great.
I really like the Darth Vader theme introduced in Empire Strikes Back. It is so military and creepy and powerful.
One of my absolute favorite musical sequences is in the original Star Wars, the scene where Luke watches the twin sunset on Tatooine.
Yes, that melody is Williams at his best. So sweeping and orchestral and emotionally evocative.
I got the complete soundtracks when they came out, and I listen to them often.
The music really holds up. It's a testament to Williams's talent that the scores are still so standout.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the better villian, Darth Vader or Kylo Ren?
Darth Vader, obivously.
Why do you say that?
Becuase he is a tormented figure, and he had his reason's for going bad.
True, but what about Kylo Ren?
Please, he's second rate by comparsion.
How do you figure.
All he has is a warped idolation for Darth and a total failure to learn from his example.
Which was what?
Don't turn to the Dark SIde, it will cost everything you love and destroy you in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you have a favorite Star Wars movie?
Yeah, The Empire Strikes Back.
Okay, any particular reason why that's your favorite?
I love the snow battle with the AT-ATs and the airspeeders.
That is very good, anything else.
Well, Luke and the fight with the wampa in the ice cave is a pretty good scene.
That was great, did you feel the additional footage with the CGI wampa was an improvement?
It was and it wasn't.
What do you mean?
On one hand, the monster was a bit scarier when we couldn'
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know there's a lot wrong with the Star Wars prequel trilogy--
You could do a whole college course on how not to do a sequel by studying those movies.
But what do you think was the main problem? Was there one thing you could point to and fix, and the trilogy would get better?
I think one of the major flaws was the relationship between Amidala and Anakin. It wasn't credible.
I know it was kind of weird that Amidala was so much older than Anakin.
Unfortunately, the age difference was compounded when they were both adults, because Amidala was so responsible and aware, and Anakin was a complainy mopey baby.
I wonder what George Lucas was thinking. Here was the future Darth Vader, and he needed all the positive lovable qualities he could get, to make his seduction by the Dark Side all the more tragic.
You could say, but wait, Amidala fell in love with him, so that means he's wonderful! But if a relationship is not based in credible reality, the whole thing just feels contrived - which this did.
I must admit, I'm hard pressed to list any quality of Anakin's that would compel a beautiful princess to fall in love with him.
And the effectiveness of the whole trilogy, and the tragedy of Anakin becoming Darth, hinges on that relationship. So the trilogy was a total fail story-wise for me, because the love story was contrived and stupid and nonsense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what did you think was better, return of the Jedi or the empire strikes back?
I actually liked return of the Jedi better
seriously, why?
without Jedi, there is no conclusion to the story, and therefore empire is pointless
yeah, but all of the best drama is in Empire
I disagree, the most eventful action takes place in Return of the Jedi
but the best light saber fight of the middle three happens in in empire
light saber fighting isn't the only thing that made me enjoy the serires
you are crazy for liking Return of the Jedi more than Empire Strikes Back
you are just saying that because of that scene in the movie clerks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
You mean the Force Awakens? Yes I have
No, I mean Rogue One, the spin-off movie
I haven't even heard of it before now. What is it about?
It's about the group of rebels who steal the plans for the Death Star
Oh, is it any good?
Yeah, I really enjoyed it even though it's almost entirely new characters to the series
Who else is in it from the other films?
Bail Organa is in it briefly, and so is Mon Mothma when she's younger, but that's about it
Sounds interesting. I was always curious what happened before the beginning of A New Hope, so I'll check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite Star Wars light saber battle?
The battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi.
Yes, the mood and the music really shows Luke Skywalker's anger and struggle.
And when he finally bests Vader and chops his robot hand off, it is so intense.
What do you think about the whole Vader redeems himself at the end thing?
I guess seeing his son getting destroyed by Palpatine stirred something in him.
And then Vader got to become a force ghost at the end.
But then George Lucas changed the original force ghost to Hayden Christensen from the prequels.
Yeah, that was a bit of an odd choice.
As were many of George Lucas' changes to the original films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the new Star Wars movies?
They're alright, I guess. Although I've only seen the Force Awakens and not Rogue One.
How'd you like the Force Awakens?
It was ok. I am more of a fan of the very first Star Wars trilogy.
Did you like the characters and the new storyline at all?
It was interesting to see what happens after Darth Vader was killed and how there's pretty much another Darth Vader in training.
Yea, it was such a surprise when I found out Kylo Ren was Han and Leia's kid.
Yea, I would have never guessed that.
I felt like that actor did a good job though of playing that part.
Yea, I was kind of skeptical at first, but I really enjoyed his performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the Hans Solo movie?
I am now that Ron Howard is directing it!
Is he? No way! I hadn't hear that.
Yeah! I have more confidence in it now.
I don't think I actually care about the early life of Hans Solo.
Well, maybe we can learn about how he met Chewbaca?
I haven't enjoyed the prequels at all, and this one doesn't look like it'll be better.
But you liked Rogue one!
That's true. That one was good.
But, everyone isn't going to die at the end of this one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Star Wars movies have you seen?
A lot.
But how many exactly?
I've seen all 7 and the offshoot, Rogue 1.
Did you have a favorite one?
My favorite was Return of the Jedi.
Did you know that Mark Hamel went to my high school?
Get out, really?
Yes, but he was an alum.  Before my time.
Neat!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is better: Episode I or II?
Wow, they're both awful.
Awfully entertaining!
No, they're just bad.
So, which is worse, hater?
Episode I for sure. Two has awful dialogue, but One has no actual use.
They found Anakin.
Yeah, and that's it. Plus, he's obnoxious.
You know he got bullied so hard he quit acting, right?
Guess the Force wasn't strong with him, was it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think A New Hope might not be quite as good as Empire, but it's top three and definite more important.
Agreed all the way.  Star Wars changed the way we see movies forever.
A New Hope also had the second best story line, maybe Rougue One could give it a run for it's money.  But it's a long shot.
Yes, Especially when you look to old copies when Han shot first.
Totally important.  It changes the character a little.   Now he has a little more goodness he didn't have and his turn around isn't has exciting.
Han has always been one of my favorites.
Him and Chewy, the ultimate bromance.  I love those guys.
I know, I was sad when he died.  But when I heard Chewy cry it almost made me cry.  They've been together so long.
I wonder what will happen to Chewy now?  He's one of those long time characters that just means so much.
I'm looking forward to seeing how they met in the Han Solo movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Star Wars movies do you think they will end up making?
As many as can be profitable.
That's kind of cynical, don't you think?
I'm just sick of seeing another movie franchise being sold to the highest bidder, and then being squeezed for every penny it's worth.
I don't think it's as bad as all that, because I can see some creativity in these new movies.
I guess they are still entertaining, and it will be nice to see what another director can do with the characters and world of Star Wars.
Yes, J.J. Abrams is a competent science-fiction guy, so I put my trust into him.
I agree, but I think that some of his stuff like Lost didn't finish well.
Well I'm on board for these movies just to see how Luke Skywalker figures into the new plot.
I'll admit, it was very cool seeing Mark Hamill play that role again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite star wars ship?
I like the U-Wing.
Why that one?
Because it's fast, has plenty of room and looks like it would be fun to fly.
What about the Millennium Falcon?
I don't know.  It looks like a piece of junk.
Are you quoting Han Solo?
I'm trying to.
Don't you think Harrison Ford is so old?
Yes, it's scary to see him in those movies.  I don't want him to get hurt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you think Luke would join the dark side in Return of the Jedi?
No
Even when Darth Sidious was manipulating him?
Yeah, I knew he would not turn
Did you ever doubt him?
No, I knew he was good all the way through
What did you think of his costume?
It worked well for him. I liked the black
Did you like the lightsaber battle from the second, or third film better?
The second
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars heroine do you like the most?
I really like Rey, but Princess Leia will always be my favorite heroine!
I also like Princess Leia the most!
I think it is sad that we won't get to see her in the upcoming Star Wars movies anymore.
I know, I was so bummed out when I heard what happened.
This means that the mantle will be passed down to Rey.
I have faith that Rey is going to become a great main character!
So do I!
I can't wait to see her fighting more with the lightsaber!
I wish the next Star Wars movie came out already!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in star wars?
Jar Jar Binks, makes me laugh when he talks.
What movie inspires you too watch more?
Saw the first one's, but i really enjoyed clone wars. Love the massive army's
Do you collect action figures or merchandise by star wars?
Yea, everything from posters and old toys.
Has star wars influenced on how you go day by day through life?
It's something to look forward too. I would like to live a life style like that.
Do you play any star wars games?
Love the n64 days, the star wars games really kicked ass. And all the battle fronts are great too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Return of the Jedi.
That's my favorite!  I loved the Ewoks.
Yes, they were super cute.
What was your favorite scene?
I loved it when Leia kills Jabba the Hut.
Carrie Fisher looked great then.
I also liked the ending, with the fight against the Emperor.
Yes, that was pretty cool.
I wasn't pleased that they removed Ray Milland at the end.
I didn't know that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite moment in all of 'Star Wars' history?
I'd have to say that my favorite, single shot has to be when Luke is standing at his Uncle's house, looking out into the horizon.
That was a really powerful scene.  Luke looking out into Tatooine's two suns, as John Williams' score started to play.
I think it's impossible not to think about John Williams when thinking about Star Wars.
I couldn't agree more.  They go together so well.
What was your favorite scene of all time?
Mine was in 'A New Hope,' when Han flies in and saves Luke at the end.
I was so excited when I first watched that scene.  Han's character evolved the most in the whole franchise.
Yea.  He starts out a scoundrel, ends up becoming a true hero.
That made his loss all the more depressing.  I was so sad when he died in 'The Force Awakens.'
XXXXXXXXXXX
The changed effects in the blurays just look out of place
Are they bad though
No they are not bad
How are they out of place
They are to high of quality
How is that possible
Well the image does not match
So the resolution
Pretty much
They messed it up then
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
No, I think it's terrible
What? Seriously?
Yeah, the characters are so boring and static
How many have you seen?
Just the first couple
You mean Episode I or Episode IV
Whichever one they have the race
Oh well that's the problem, the prequels are terrible. Watch the originals first
Alright I guess I'll give them another try
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the prequels?
I did not think that they were as bad as everyone thinks.
How about Jar Jar Binks?
Now that's something that everyone got right. He was pretty annoying.
Yeah he really didn't do much even after Queen Amidalia got in the senate.
I was surprised that the original senator turned into the emperor.
Yeah he seemed like such a good guy in episode 1 the phantom manis.
He must have been smart to plan all that.
But how cool was Darth Maul when they opened those double doors and he turned his double light saber on one side at a time?
The best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am definitely a Star Wars fanatic, I've seen every movie dozens of times.
I like the movies, but it's definitely not something I'm in love with.
I've even dressed up as a Storm trooper for Rouge One.
I think that is awesome, I've dressed up my dog as Yoda and an ewok before.
It seems like you're a fan of the series than!
I really just love the characters of the series, they definitely make the series for me.
I could agree with that, but the plot and story line is so phenomenal to me.
I'm glad you love it so much, there are so many new movies coming out!
You're so right, I'll be at the midnight showing for each and every one of them!
I believe you, but I'll be in bed sleeping.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish "Rogue One" was more Jedi stuff in it.
What do you mean?
Well, it just felt different than the other Star Wars movies to me. It was more battle stuff and not enough Jedi.
Yeah, but it made sense for the overall plot that it played out like it did. It was about regular people doing what needed to be done.
Yeah, I guess you're right. I did like that aspect of it though. The rebels being just soldiers, doing their duty, at all costs, to get the plans to the Death Star.
It would have been a totally different movie if it had been Obi Wan and Yoda and all the other Jedi in that battle.
True. The ultimate sacrifice of Jynn, Cassian, K2-SO and the rest of the rebel group made the victory that much richer.
But don't worry, you'll get your Jedi fix soon. The next movie is called "The Last Jedi" after all!
Woohoo! I can't wait. Want to go see it together?
I wouldn't miss it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So here is a question about Star Wars, why is it not more disturbing that Leia and Luke pretty much got it on?
I guess in the future incest is not frowned upon
Yeah I guess considering people are even sleeping with Aliens
Yup, like Jabba the Hut
No way that Alien is doing anything with Women.
I don't know why else would he have dressed Leia up in that skimpy little bikini looking thing
True, I guess I didn't look at it like that
Still the Visual is pretty freaking gross
Yes it is, now I need to go look at some pretty lady's to get that out of my head
Too true i'm right behind you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite star wars scene?
The one where Yoda takes the X Wing out of the water
That scene is amazing
They played that at my church in middle school
That's sacreligious
I think they were talking about faith
Jedi training would be tough
Yoda had a great environment to train Luke
Luke was a better Jedi than him
He did beat the Emperor
XXXXXXXXXXX
Out of all of the Star Wars movies, who is your favorite character?
I think like a lot of the fans out there, mine was always Han Solo.
He is up there for me, as well. How surprised were you at this untimely demise in Force Awakens?
I actually wasn't too caught off guard by it, since Harrison Ford has stated he's always wanted Solo to be killed off.
I've heard that, as well. In terms of his character, do you think it wasn't a very heroic death?
I was okay with it the way it executed. He died while trying to save his son.
I understand your point. It was also in a way, a sort of passing the torch off to the new character.
Definitely. And I wouldn't rule out recurring appearances of him.
You think they'll bring Solo back in flashbacks/visions?
Quite possibly. He was an extremely popular character so any way to bring him back would be great. Especially for the final episode.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the name of the planet Luke lives on?
Tatooine
Isn't that planet in the prequels?
Yes
Cool. Does Jabba the Hutt live there?
I believe so. At least he does in Episode 1
What is the name of the bad guy who dislikes Anakin in Episode 1?
Sebulba
I thought he was mean.
He was and he was digital too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when Luke trained with Yoda?
Yeah, that was a weird planet
Dagoba system. Very remote location.
Yes, and full of all kinds of weird creatures.
And then there was that one scene where Luke encounters Darth Vader
Oh yeah and he chops off his head.
Right, and then it shows his face as Darth Vader
I never understood that scene.
Maybe it was a foreshadowing of things to come?
Perhaps, I guess Yoda was just screwing with him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which star wars movie is your favorite?
My favorite is probably episode 3.
Yeah, that was a good one.  Why is that your favorite?
Because you get to see the birth of darth vader.
Is he your favorite character?
Yes, i have always liked that character since the original trilogy.
Do you think he and Luke are a lot alike?
Yes.  I just think Luke was better at controlling his anger.  It wouldn't surprise me if Luke ended up going to the dark side at some point.
Yeah, i have always thought that about him.
Hopefully he won't, but it just seems like his character is at least partially in touch with the dark side of the force.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What is your favorite of all the star wars films?
I really like the force unleased a lot.
Was that the most recent one?
No, I think the most recent one was rogue one.
Ah okay.
Did you like that one?
Yeah I really did enjoy that one.
Me too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest Star Wars movie, Rogue One.
Yes, I did.  It was really well.
I loved the blind Chinese guy who had the force.
I know, he was awesome.  He kicked some ass.
Even, thought you knew how it was going to end based on the Original three movies, it was still suspensful.
Did you like "the Force Awakens"?
Yes I did,  most of it was awesome?
The part were Kylo Ren got beat up by the girl was ridiculous?  She had never done any training or anything.
That part was a little stupid.
I guess they were trying to show how powerful she was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Star Wars rogue 1?
I liked it a lot! I was surprised at how much I actually like do it.
I know what you mean, the characters were spot on.
Agreed, and it’s amazing how well the new Star Wars movies are true to the originals.
That’s why I was so happy when Disney bought the franchise, I was also a little quded but now I see that they are doing incredible things.
Yes and as a spin off doing well, I bet they’ll make more spin offs!
I heard they are working on another spin off, a Han Solo movie.
Yes there are, and I’m already excited to see what they will do with the Han Solo character.
I feel that it’s almost guaranteed to be good, if what they have done so far is anything to go by.
And don’t forget we’ve got the last Jedi to look forward to also.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars
Love them
Oh okay me too
I own all of them
Really, lucky
I know
I want relicas of the light sabers
I just got some on amazon
Oh i bet they are so cool
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars movies?
Yeah, they're pretty cool.
Who was your favorite character?
Luke Skywalker. Who was yours?
Definitely Han Solo.
Why do you like Han Solo?
Because he was the captain of the spaceship.
Yeah, that is pretty cool.
Also, his character is played by Harrison Ford.
Isn't that the guy from Indiana Jones?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Rogue One?
I thought it was exceptional.
Me too.
I like how they do the back story on the Rebels getting the Death Star plans.
I thing that a smart move by Disney.
They're going to milk this sacred cow for all it's worth.
It's working for them.
They're making money hand over fist.
I think The Force Awakens was the highest grossing film in history.
Wouldn't suprise me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first Star Wars movie you saw?
I watched Star Wars A New Hope when I was a little kid?
Who did you watch it with?
I watched it with my dad the first time.
What is your favorite Star Wars film?
I like Return of the Jedi better than all of the others.
What's your favorite character?
Chewy, of course.
And least favorite?
JarJar!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
Well, that is a complex question. Do you mean of the old trilogy, the newer movies, or out of all of them?
Out of all of them.
I guess I would still have to go with A New Hope.
I like the older ones better anyways.
Yeah, they will always be Star Wars to me.
Anytime Jar-Jar Binks is in a scene of the newer ones I about have to leave the room.
Oh I know, I cannot stand to here that thing talk.
Why in the world did they add him as a character?
I can see why his part was important, but why did they make him so annoying?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars scene?
I'm going to have to go with, "Luke, I am your Father."
Really?
Yeah. What a great plot twist.
True. It almost made up for the movie being so boring.
You didn't like Empire Strike Back?
No. Return of the Jedi is my favorite.
That was a good one. But mine is still A New Hope.
Very excellent film, but not my favorite.
Who knows, maybe there'll be a new favorite in the next trillogy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars?
Yes
Me too, ive seen them all
So have i
Do you have a favorite movie?
Mine is the empire strikes back
Thats a good one
What about you?
I like return of the jedi
Thats a good movie too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Jar Jar Binks will ever show up again?
In Star Wars you mean?
Where else would he?
Well, Lucas films did have a lot of cameos in Star Wars.
Really?Like what?
Well when Padme addressed the senate, with a vot of no confidence, if you look close you can find Et.
E.T is in Star Wars?
Just for a brief second.
So maybe if they make another E.T movie, Jar Jar could show up?
It is cannon they exsist in the same world.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Star Wars character?
I really like Princess Leia.
What about her particularly interested you?
Well, she is as much of a Jedi as Luke, for starters.
Despite that potential, Leia stayed pretty traditional though.
Perhaps, but we do not know what happened before the new trilogy.
I agree, and the gold bikini changed everybody's lives to some extent!
True.     Leia was not only a sex-object, but a tremendous General and warrior!
What do you think was the bravest thing Leis did?
By far, her trip to save Han Solo has to be viewed as the highlight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Luke Skywalker, who's isnt?
Well thats a very expected answer, but mine is Obi Wan Kinobi.
Why?! He just dies and doesn't really do anything useful.
He was very useful actually.
Oh, how so?
Well if it weren't for him Anakin would have never turned into Darth Vader.
Doesn't that kind of prove my point?
No, because with Vader there is no major antagonist.
That still doesn't make him useful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard that Han Solo actually improved some of his lines.
I think you mean Harrison Ford.
Yeah, sure, same guy.
What lines are you talking about?
For instance, in the second film, he improvised the line 'I know'.
You mean after Leia said she loved him?
Yep, he thought it up on the spot.
That's very interesting.  I was not aware of that.
Well, I'm full of useful trivia.
Full of something to be sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here's one thing I find confusing about the Star Wars franchise... well, one of several of things, really, but this is a big one.
Okay, what's that?
The Clone Wars.  I mean, they've got a TWO series that were called The Clone Wars and a full length movie, and it's like, could they not come up with another title?
Wait, they had two series called Clone Wars?
Yeah, one was like a series of five minute shows that aired on Cartoon Network before Revenge of the Sith came out.  They kind of bridged the gap between the last two prequel films.
Oh, yeah, think I remember something about that.
And the other, more well known, was a full half hour series done in computer animated graphics.
Yeah, my nephew used to watch that a lot.
Yeah, but the short one is called Star Wars: Clone Wars, and the longer series is called Star Wars: THE Clone Wars.  I mean, seriously?
Yeah, I don't think they were very creative in the naming scheme there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found out that the creator of Star Wars, George Lucas, is worth over 5 billion dollars.
Wow.  That's a lot of money.
Yes.  But he has been involved with a lot of successful films.
The Star Wars franchise is my favorite.
He used Harrison Ford in both Star Wars and Indiana Jones.
Harrison Ford recently landed on the jetway instead of the runway.
Wow.  He's getting forgetful.
Poor guy.  Is he still married to Calista Flockheart?
I think so.  Remember how that was such a controversy?
Not really.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I heard a rumor the other day that I don't think is true.
Okay.  What's the rumor?
Apparently, Yoda was going to be played by a monkey originally.
A monkey?  That can't be real.
No, it's completely true.  A monkey was going to be Yoda.
Well, what made them change their mind?
I guess they thought the monkey might not pay attention on site.
Well, he is a monkey so I could see that happen.
That would have been crazy to see a monkey playing Yoda.  Just can't picture it.
Neither can I.  Glad they made the right choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ewok or Jawa.
Ewoks. Jawas are thieves.
They look a lot cooler than  Ewoks, though.
I guess I agree with that. Ewoks are overall pretty annoying.
They literally kill Return of the Jedi.
I don't know if they kill it, but it's definitely the lesser film of the Original Trilogy.
I feel like it's the worst film in the series.
No. No way. That's episode II and all it's crappy love story.
George Lucas would have done really well to let someone else handle the writing of the prequels.
He should have let someone else direct them, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the bar scene in the original Star Wars?
The one where Luke and Ben meet Han and Chewie?
Yeah, that's the one.
I thought it was really neat when I was younger, but now not so much.
Yeah, some of the costumes haven't aged very well.
Right, some really ridiculous looking aliens
I liked when Obi Wan chopped off the guy's arm though
Oh yeah that was cool. One of the first time seeing a lightsaber in action.
Right, cool scene
Yeah, lightsabers are rad
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Jar Jar Binks has got to be the worst character in the Star Wars franchise.
Ugh, totally.  The character itself could have been really interesting but the way they had him talk was just so annoying.
I know! He came from an interesting world, an interesting culture and you don't care one thing about him because you just can't stand to hear him talk.
The worst, the absolute worst was when Padme puts him in charge of being a senator for Naboo while she's away in Attack of the Clones.
Agreed! It's like, "Who's the dumbest guy I know from planet? Oh OK, I'll put him in charge while I'm busy!"
It just just so dumb.  Who would listen to him?
Their planet is at risk, their whole republic is at risk and she puts a guy you couldn't trust to make a takeout order in charge of everything.
And he's such a coward! He just gave up and surrendered in the big battle against the droid army in Phantom Menace.
I don't blame the other Gungams for kicking him out.
Me either, he probably would have flipped the switch that flooded the whole city thinking he was turning the lights on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Emperor from Star Wars?
Yes, he was one bad dude
Yeah, all the lightning bolts out of his hands
Crazy weapon. Almost unstoppable.
Until Darth Vader threw him down the big hole
Yeah, that was a pretty wicked demise
Wasn't he a Senator at one point.
Right, until the dark side got him
All people can turn bad I suppose
Right, except for Yoda
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the original Star Wars movie?
I don't think I have.
It is really good -we should watch it.
Who is in it?
Harrison Frord plats Han Solo and Carroe Fisher plays Princess Leia.
Didn't Carrie Fisher die recently?
Yeah her and her mom both passed away.
That's rough.
Yeah but she was good in the movie.
Alright let's watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how strong was sidius anyway
i dont think he was that powerful
he lost to mace windu.
he might have just been pretending so anakin would save him
he looked pretty pained though. i dont know.
he got killed by vader pretty easily though.
he also killed vader back though.
vader was already weak though.
thats true.
i guess he wasnt that tough
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Dark side or the Light?
I'm a fan of the dark side.
I wish I had storm troopers following me around.
I like how they jog around.  I like the sound of they make on the floor.
Did you like Finn as a stormtrooper?
I thought it was an interesting inclusion.  It's good to see more diversity in the First Order.
Yeah, the rebel alliance is so much more diverse.  They even have interspecies commanders.
Like the fish.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Diversity for the universe!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I think it's funny?
i know what's funny. All the conspiracy theories about the identity of the new characters.
Yep, there was this idiot theory that went around saying Jar Jar Binks is the Plagueis AND the supreme leader Snoke.
That was so stupid. How did they even come with that?
Something about the only Gungan Jedi turning to the dark side at the same time when Jar Jar was in Gungan.
There was a Gungan Jedi?
There were two, actually. Kin-Ya Dosun the master, and his padawan Kin-Ya Hadu who later emerges as a Sith.
And they're saying Jar Jar is Kin-Ya Hadu, and the Sith Lord Plagueis?
Yes, which is why he was able to kill so many of the drone soldiers being as clumsy as he is. That clumsiness is a part of his disguise.
Ok, then that still doesn't explain the Snoke's appearances.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about movies
Great what catergory
Star wars
Okay, i love those movies
Me too
What one is your favorite
The clone wars
Thats a good one
What about you
The return of the jedi
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Star Wars movie, The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes, that's one of the few I did see.
Harrison Ford was so young in that movie.
Well sure, it is from 1980.
Carrie Fisher too.
Sad, she passed away. Those movies will keep her memory alive.
Yes they will. That's listed as one of the best 500 movies of all times.
Is it really.
Yes, I read an article about some of the classic movies.
I bet there were a lot from the eighties.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite battle in the 'Star Wars' universe?
This is a controversial answer, but I loved the final battle in 'Attack of the Clones.'
You're right, it is controversial!  What about it did you like?
I just thought it was so cool seeing that many Jedi together, fighting along each other.  It was the first time anyone saw that.
It was rather large scale.  Definitely unique at that point in time, because other movies showed two Jedi at most.
What was your favorite battle?
I loved the battle on 'Hoth.'
Which one was that?
It was the one on the ice planet.  The scene where Luke destroys the AT-AT was phenomenal.
You're right, that was a cool scene.  I'm changing my answer to that one as well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Luke Skywalker is the bad guy in Star Wars?
What, no, he's the good guy.
He killed a bunch of innocent people.
No he didn't.
The Death Star was being rebuilt.
Yeah but it was full of bad guys.
No way they have that many storm troopers that are master builders, building the Death Star.
They had to have a few.
The Empire had to call in every contractor in the galaxy for something that big and Luke killed them.
Well, when you take a job on the Death Star you accept some risk.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
Rogue One
Why
I liked the Death Star.
It was a great weapon.
I don't think you can fire lasers and blow up planets.
It is a little far fetched.
I like the concept of a round space station.
It makes sense, just hard to make something that big.
It would be expensive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you tell me something about lighstabers?
What would you like to know?
Well, why are they so rare and hard to find?  I feel like they should be readily available on a galactic market.
You'd think that but there are a couple reasons.
Oh? Like what?
Well the crystals are extremely rare first of all.
Is that all?
No, technically they are only supposed to be assembled by a young Jedi, they are built by the user.
Some sort of ritual?
That's a bit simplistic, more of a tradition among force-sensitives to go from being a padiwan to being a jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Rouge One, they finally explained how they got the information on the Death Star.  What are your thoughts?
Horrible.  Absolutely horrible?
Why is that?
Think about it...  One guy designs a flaw so large and NO ONE notices?
Well, he didnt make it obvious, remember?
So what?  There were like 1000 engineers working on that thing and no one noticed?
I guess not...
Yeah, completely unbelievable!
You do know its just a movie right?
So what, they need to get their stuff straight!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think it would have been awful to live on the Death Star.
Well, it blows up, so yes, it would have been.
I meant before that.  It's cold, large, empty of emotion.
But probably was an engineering feat if you think about it.
How many people would it have taken to build that thing?
I would think tens of thousands.  It was basically a small planet
How many people lived on it you think.
Who knows, but I'm guessing several thousand.
And now they're all dead.
You are truly a buzzkill.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Force Awakens.
Who directed it?
J.J. Abrams, the Star Trek movie director.
Cool.  Who was your favorite in the movie?
Carrie Fisher, in her last role.  She still looked good.
How about Rey?
Daisy Ridley?  She was magnificent.
I liked Kylo Ren.
Sad what happens to Han Solo.
Mark Hamill looked super old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is your favorite robot in the Star Wars movies?
Okay, that's a hard one. Let me think.
Mine is C3PO.  So funny.
Okay well I have to say BB8.
BB8, cool!  He's adorable.
And capable, right?
Naturally.  JJ created a next-gen robot with heart.
I loved the way he rolled to get anywhere.
Yeah I think pretty much he stole every scene.
Kind of like R2D2, but with an updated personality.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever notice the connection between Star Wars and Et: The Extra Terrestrial?
No!  Seriously there's a connection?
Yes.  If you watch ET, you will see Yoda, and if you watch Star Wars, you'll see ET.
I remember ET in Star Wars.  He was in the senate in episodes 1-3, right?
Yes!  Good memory.
But where was Yoda in ET?
Well, remember when they went trick-or-treating on Halloween?
Yeah
A kid was dressed up as Yoda, and when ET saw him, he signaled him as if he knew him.
Wow!  Mind blown!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is luke?
Main character from star wars
Why does Darth Vader wear a mask?
I think because he was badly burned.
Who is the character that looks like a dog?
That is Chewbacca.
Why is Jar-Jar Binks so hated?
He is annoying and constantly ruined things.
Why did Anakin choose the dark side?
He didn't it choose him and he couldn't control the power the force gave.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like The Force Awakens?
I thought it was a litte boring.
Why do you say that?
Because there were new characters I suppose.
OK I get where you are coming from.
I just wanted the same characters from the first 6.
But even when they did the first 3 they were all new.
Yeah and it took forever to get attached to them.
Well Luke is grown up now.
I hate his self exile. Think its lazy writing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could learn more about any side character in Star Wars who would it be?
Boba Fett for sure.  He was competent enough to fight Jedi and have Han on the run.
Yes, and that alone is worthy of a story.  He has never had enough screen time.
Plus I heard he escaped from that monster on Tatooine.
Yeah I heard that too, it would be exciting to see how he has done what he's done and what goes on after Tatooine.
We saw him as a kid, I would like to see how he trained and became such a great character.
I've always wondered that too, who trained him?  Is he force sensitive and doesn't know it?
I have a feeling that while not all the characters have force powers as strong as a Jedi, they are force adjacent you could say.
I agree, Obi-Wan says there is no such thing as luck, and these guys are way too skilled to not be using some type of force powers.
Yes, maybe not force sensitive like a Jedi or Sith, but they get a little nudge from it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think the Last Jedi will play out?
I think we might see the end of Luke.
In what way?
They may have him go into exile somewhere that cannot be found
You think thats how his character dies?
We wont ever see it happen
Could he come back in future films?
I think the plotline will allow for that.
Thats a sad ending to an iconic character
You never know with the way directors want to go now
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Vader would have stayed good, had he not died in Star Wars?
I do not know, I think for a time.
He was so powerful, so much force was in him.
Yes, and it went dark, but Luke was powerful too.
There was a scene, when he confronts Jabba, where he is wearing black clothes and looking murderous, do you think that showed he will turn bad?
I think it shows he has the capacity. It is a tight balance, good and evil.
I wish he would, maybe start a new line of siths.
Darth Maul, maybe he could be the new him. Luke Maul.
I am serious, then he could be in control of the balance.
I do not think one man having that much power is any control of the force.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is it December yet?
No, why?
I am counting down the days until The Last Jedi comes out.
Is that the name of the new Star Wars movie?
Yes!
I didn't really like the new one that came out.
Really? I loved it.
I just really like the originals.
I get that I guess.
It just doesn't get better than the New Hope!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really excited for the new Star Wars movie The Last Jedi.
I think the trailers look good.  I think Disney may be over doing it with Star Wars though.
How do you mean?
Well, they seem to be coming out every year with the trilogy films.
Yeah but the older ones released once a year too until they were done.
They also had Rogue One and they're doing a Han Solo movie.  Its just a lot of Star Wars.  I'm afraid they'll do too much.
I guess you're right.  The prequels were so bad though and I thought The Force Awakens was really good so hopefully they'll continue that.
I thought The Force Awakens was ok.  It was basically a retelling of Episode 4.  The deathstar was just bigger.
I guess I can see that.  I really did like Rey though, as a new jedi she's pretty cool.
She was pretty cool.  I guess we'll just have to see if this one is any good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies
Yes
Which ones
I really like the star wars series
Those are good movies
Yes they are
Have you read the comics
No
I have
Ive been meaning to
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character from the prequal trilogy?
I think my favorite character is Sebulba.
Haha, that is a great one.
Yeah, he is Anakin's podracing 'nemesis' and he is one of the most unique looking aliens in the whole series.
I can't disagree there, he is pretty freaky looking.
I remember when I was young I thought it was so funny how he got around with his arms and used his feet as hands.
I'd be curious to know who came up with that character design.
Me too, I know he was voiced by Lewis McLeod.
Oh now I remember that, he even had to learn some Huttese, the language Jaba speaks.
Yeah it definitely wouldn't be the easiest language to learn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Are you a big fan of star wars?
I don't know about a big fan, but I have enjoyed some of the movies?
Which ones?
The newer ones have been really good to see in theaters.
What newer one do you like the most?
I enjoyed Rogue One quite a bit.
Why?
It had a darker, harder edge to it.  I really liked that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to watch Return of the Jedi tonight?
Sure, I love that movie!
I think it's a great ending to the original Star Wars trilogy.
What's your favorite part?
I think my favorite is when Leia tells Han that Luke is her brother.
My favorite is when Luke defeats the Emperor.
And the Ewoks are so cute!
Yeah, I'm sorry they changed the ending music! I miss the Ewok song.
It was great to see a happy ending for everyone, and to see Darth Vader get redeemed.
Yeah, after watching the prequels, that was really good to see!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wow, I can't believe the original Star Wars movie is 40 years old!
Yeah, it came out in 1977.
Who knew it would be so popular?
I don't think anyone knew.
I still think It was the best one if all.
I like it too. Who is your favorite character?
Han Solo.  What about you!
Chewbacca for sure!
It's a great movie, even after all these years!
It sure is.  I could watch it a million times!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the worst Star Wars movie, in your opinion?
I don't even need to think about that one.  It was 'Phantom Menace.'
What didn't you like about it.
Well, the most glaring thing was that there were way too many Senate meetings and boring dialogue.
You're right.  I remember even as a kid, those scenes made me want to fast forward.
Also, the dialogue was so badly written.  And the rules for the Jedi were poorly established.
Yea, the rules were always unclear to me.  For instance, why does romantic love lead to the dark side?
I have absolutely no idea.  Also, the age gap between Padma and Anakin was a bit disturbing to me.
You're right.  Even though they fixed it in the next movie, I'll always remember that child as Anakin.
They should have just began the prequel right from Anakin being trained as a young Jedi.  Without the backstory of Tatooine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like better, R2D2 or C3PO?
I don't know if that is a fair comparison.  I mean, R2D2 never speaks English.
But he's so cute!
Well, by never speaking English, he can't be as annoying at C3PO.
You think C3PO is annoying?
Yes, he's pompous.  I don't even care when they take him apart.
The only thing I don't like is how he doesn't know who Luke is in the first movie.
Well, that just shows it wasn't well planned.
I also don't like how they don't explain what happened to his arm in the new movie.
I read that was just to show that time had passed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear that Carrie Fisher died?
Yes I did. I wonder what they're going to do about Princess Leia in the new Star Wars movies.
Do you think they're going to kill her character off like they did with Han Solo?
Maybe, but they would have to do it off screen.
Maybe they could have another actress play Leia.
I don't think they could replace such a classic character.
That's true, I guess they'll just have to figure something out.
I wonder if they will have to change the plot around to reflect Kylo Ren's parents both being dead.
A lot of the characters don't seem to have parents though - Leia, Luke, Anakin, Ray all were missing parents.
Well, I can't wait to see what they do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One yet?
No, but I've heard about it.
Dude, it's awesome.
I just saw the Force Awakens.
Well, go see Rogue One.
What's it about?
I don't want to spoil it, but it's about how Vader becomes the man.
Well now that does sound pretty good.
It's better than Force Awakens.
Damn, now I've got to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Empire Strikes Back will always be the most overrated Star Wars film.
That's blasphemy.  It's still the best.
Everybody says that, but I just don't see it.
It has it all.  Best action, best ending...
Not saying it doesn't have redeeming qualities, I'm saying it's overrated.
Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  To me, the original is overrated.
Now you're being silly.  That's the movie that kicked everything off!
It's also a bit weak outside of the special effects story-wise.
We obviously have different tastes in our Star Wars picks.
Would seem so.  We should have a mock lightsaber battle to settle this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Revenge of the Sith last night.
Didn't that one have a bunch of Lucas family members playing bit parts?
Jeff, Amanda, and Katie are in the movie.
Was Hayden Christensen his dreamy self?
He did another good job as Anakin.
What was the saddest scene?
The second saddest was when Anakin kills a bunch of kid Jedis.
Right, bad.
The saddest was Padme's funeral.
Goodbye,  Natalie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Kilo Ren in the Force Awakens?
I thought he was a little weak.
What do you mean?  He stopped a blaster full on out.
I just didn't appreciate the temper tantrums in an otherwise good movie.
You're right about that.  Vader would never have had a tantrum.
Exactly, he may be powerful but needs to grow up.
You are right about the blaster scene though.  That was amazing.
He also seemed to know something about Rey, he was pretty upset when he found out who she was.
Maybe they're cousins.
Seems a little obvious but that would make sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think they never tried to properly train Leia to be a Jedi if it was so imperative to have one?
They probably still wanted to keep her existence a secret to keep her safe and ensure there was another Skywalker around.
Why do regular people leave behind corpses when the corpses of Jedi vanish?
I think it's because Jedi are so in tune with the force that their corporeal selves become a part of it when they die.
If they made a backstory movie on any character, who would you want it to be on?
Obi Wan Kenobi because he's a very interesting character and I'd like to see him as a child and as he was training under Gui Gon.
What do you think of the newest Star Wars movies?
I think Disney is doing them justice and I have been thoroughly enjoying them.
What movie was the first one you ever saw?
I first saw Empire Strikes Back when I was a little kid. I caught it on TV and was instantly hooked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Could you see Darth Vader ever making a return?
The episode would have to come between 3 and 4 for that to happen.
You dont think they could revisit the 4, 5, and 6 episodes and maybe do something?
No I think that story has already been told.
I just think James Earl Jones played an awesome villain.
He did and his voice was perfect.
I just wish Kylo Ren could do the same.
He can but we have to keep an open mind.
I think he needs to start a more murderous rampage
Yeah you need the brutal ways of an evil empire
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Star Wars, episode three, when is Anakin a real Sith.
Well, he starts it as soon as he killed innocents.
So, when he killed the younglings?
No, before, when he went to see his mom, then slaughtered the sand people, even the young.
So, he was a sith, more or less when he made Luke and Leai.
More or less, he was on the path to the dark side even then, far in the path.
So, maybe his darkness is in their force.
It is, Luke gets angry, but dark and light is in all Jedi.
But the Sith give in and the Jedi dont.
Right, some sith used to be Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think that old Ben kenobi let Darth Vader kill him like that in A New Hope?
You know I always assumed that it had to do with him becoming a force ghost. But Yoda and Qui Gon became ghosts and neither of them had to let someone kill them.
I kind of think maybe it had to do with letting Vader know he had no power over him. That he wasn't going to really win.
I guess that kind of makes sense. But you'd think old Ben could have accomplished a lot more while alive.
That may be true, but everyone dies eventually. He became one with the force and still guided Luke to victory.
It's also been said that he was able to communicate with Qui Gon Jinn, and that it was all part of some bigger plan. Maybe that's why he did it.
You see that's why I love Star Wars. There's still so much of the lore that remains secret and mysterious.
I mean it was certainly necessary for the plot to advance, for Luke to undertake the hero's journey.
But in any good story you need to justify these things. Yes you kill the parents and the mentors for the hero to grow, but you have to make it make sense.
I agree with this. The movie wouldn't have been as interesting if Old Ben had stayed alive and fought the empire.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Star Wars Episode one, Return of the Sith, is Padme the queen or is Amadala?
They are the same, kind of.
How is that? One day its one then its the next.
Padme is the name she goes by, when her title is shown it is amadala.
But there are two of them in the movie.
No, on is her maid. Her maid posses as her.
Oh, so when she died it was not the queen but the maid?
Yes, she did this for protection and also to have more freedom to explore.
So, there is only one and she acted like she was the hand maid.
That sums it up. Padme was both Padme and the queen-princess-senator.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hoy
Hello hah
What are you planning tonight
I am at work right now
Well what time do you get off
in like 3 hours
Well want to come over after
And do what
We can watch Rogue One
I have yet to see that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Force Awakens?
I really liked the story line and the Rey was my favorite character.
Ya I thought she was awesome. I liked how it seems she know about the Force.
Ya I think there is more to her story we don't know about.
Ya same here. I can't wait to find out if she is related to Luke or someone else.
I wonder what they will do about Leia's character?
ya it's sad that Carrie Fisher died.
Ya I wonder if they will address that in the next movie. I forget what it is called.
I think it's called The Last Jedi.
That's right. I wonder if that person is Rey.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think about all the new Star Wars movies?
I don't know if I'm a fan.  I'm a bit of a purist.
Me too.  I grew up with the original Star Wars three, and I'm not all that interested in the new franchise.
Yeah, neither am I.  What was your favorite of the first three?
I would have to say The Empire Strikes Back.  I am a big fan of Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and the newer movies just don't have the same panache.
Yeah, I really liked Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker.  The newer actors don't have as much appeal.
I had a Princess Leia doll from the original Star Wars movie.  She looked just like the character in the movie.
That is so cool.  Do you still have it?  I had some smaller action figures.
Yes, I do.  It probably isn't worth much though because I played with it a lot.
I think I need to introduce the original 3 Star Wars movies to my own kids.  You just can't beat the Cantina Band and Boba Fett.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I'll have to think about that one for a minute. Who's yours?
It's easy to say Luke Skywalker, since he's clearly the hero. But my favorite character is Yoda.
Oh, he's so cute! I kind of have a hard time taking him seriously.
Are you kidding? He's a Jedi master!
I know, but he's so small and green.
He can levitate things. He teaches Luke so much!
Ok, I guess I see your point.
Did you decide who your favorite character is?
You're going to laugh. I really like Jobba the Hutt.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think i am the odd one out
How do you think that
Well i have the most unfavorable opinion on the star wars movies
What opinion is that
That episode 2 is the best
Well i mean it is not the worst but
But what
I cannot agree it is the best
What is the best for you
Episode 3 easily
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Force awakens yet?
Is that the one with Rey in it?
Yes, and John Boyega.
Who's Jon Boyega?
Boyega plays the storm trooper who doesn't want to kill anymore.
Oh yeah, he's the guy following Rey halfway around the universe.
That's right and Luke is in it but only in the last minute.
It's been so long I forgot half the movie.
You remember, Harrison Ford dies.
Yeah, you mean Han not the actor?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best Star Wars movie?
It's "The Empire Strikes Back," of course.
It's not the original, A New Hope?
A New Hope is a good movie, but Empire Strikes Back is better.
What makes it better?
The Empire Strikes Back adds all the classic Star Wars features. It's the one that tells you what the Force is, introduces Yoda, and so on.
What about Return of the Jedi?
The Ewoks are too annoying in that movie.
And what about The Force Awakens?
While it was a good movie, it took too much of its plot direct from A New Hope. It felt derivative.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi are you excited for the upcoming Star Wars movie? The last Jedi?
Yes, I am a Star Wars fanatic! It comes out this December 2017. Right?
Yes it will be! Who would you be very interested to see in this movie?
Our Princess Leia. She will be a GENERAL Leia now.
Wait, the Carrie Fisher's character? I thought she passed away?
She passed away. But she managed to complete her work for the movie prior to her death.
I still feel bad. She was such a good actress.
I agree. Who would you be interested to see in this movie?
Maz Kanata played by Lupita Nyong'o. She is an awesome actress.
I agree! Lupita is pretty and talented!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the original Star Wars in the theater?
no, I wasn't even born yet.
which Star Wars character is your favorite?
especially with today's technology and artificial intelligence C-3PO is my favorite.
outside of acting and cinematography what film trait do you think has most added to the success of the franchise?
without a doubt that would have to be sound editing and music.
Which character do you think has evolved the most?
The obvious choice is Luke Skywalker but Darth Vader would come a close second.
Which character do you think would serve to be the central figure in the next sequel.
I think a woman like Princess Leia is ripe for the central figure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the opening credits for the Star Wars franchise?
I remember being confused at what I was looking at the first time.
Yeah it was a little confusing wasn't it?
I thought so but the music was incredible and hooked me right away.
Yes, that star wars theme music will last for many more years and is so iconic.
Do you think there is any music similar to it?
You know i've never thought about it but I don't think so, nothing quite gives the same feeling.
You're right the music just mesmerizes you and get's you excited.
The credit scroll speed was nice, do you think it was too fast?
No I think it was perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Darth Vader in the first Star Wars movie, or the second one?
He was in the original Star Wars.
What was his name in the movie?
Anakin Skywalker. You know , Lukes father.
Yeah, I know. Luke I am your father.
That line has been made fun of so many times.
Maybe because of the way he spoke in that mask.
True. Sounded like he had a breathing problem.
Was he in any more movies or just the first Star Wars?
I didn't see them all. I don't know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the prequels are superior to the original trilogy.
Eat your words.
No I mean seriously, the effects are far superior, better acting, directing, etc
Of course the special effects are better. We have CGI on much faster computers.
Even accounting for that, the imagination is so much more involved in the prequels than the original.
I don't even know what that even means. For its day, the original trilogy was pretty good in terms of the storyline and imaginative uses of so many things
Like what?
Light saber for instance. Who wold've imagined a sword made of light?
Now that you put it like that...
Yep. It was pretty innovative thinking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Pod Racing?
Like in the Star Wars movies?
Exactly.
I love it, though it is a little extreme.
I agree, no holds barred appraoch to winning is a bit much for my taste.
That being said it's awesome.
I wish I could drive one.
Me too, it's like Nascar but with hovercars.
I want one now.
Let's build it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I heard your sister finally introduced you to the Star Wars movies.
Just the first 3. The actual first 3 that came out, not the ones that are supposed to take place first.
What did you think?
I think she recruited a new fan.
So you liked them!
My eyes were glued to the TV the whole time.
Favourite part?
Oh, probably the whole relationship between r2d2 and c3po.
They are great together. I love c3po's calm demeanor in the face of some scary situations.
Yeah me too! And I feel like as non-humans they're almost more relateable, just because they're not the ones totally obsessed with interests of the opposite gender.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One?
Yes, The ending was so sad.
Right? I really liked Jyn and Cassian.
They both would have been good long term characters.
I guess their story had to go how it did so that it blends into the original three movies.
True, but I would have made the robot for more future movies rather than an earlier story.
Oh K-2S0? Yeah C-3P0 seems to be a step back in intelligence.
I think so too. K-2S0 is much more advanced in interaction and of course humor.
Absolutely! I loved the banter between him and the human characters.
That was some of the best dialog in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know whatelse is weird?
Oh God, now what?
Why does Kylo Ren have to wear a mask too?
Because he's a gradnson of Darth Vader! And Darth Vader wears a mask
But we just said, Darth Vader's mask is wrong.
I didn't say it's wrong. You said the reason for the mask is weird. And it's for the drama of the experience. it'd be weird if he didn't have a mask
Why, because he's a grandson of Darth Vader who wore the unneeded mask?
The mask is needed. The mask is necessary. It defines Darth Vader!
Well, it's the wrong and stupid definition, if you ask me. And the same goes for Klyo. He doesn't need the mask. He's just wearign it for no reason.
The reason is that he's the grandson of Darth Vader! That's why he has to wear a mask! it defines them both!.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long do you think it takes Leia to do her hair?
Ha! I doubt she does it.
Why?
She's a princess, dude!
True.
That must have taken a crew member a couple hours.
For two buns?!
I don't know. I'm not a chick.
Your pretty interested for being so "masculin."
Whatever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the character Chewbakka from the Star Wars series?
Yes he's the furry one right?
Yes he is, he's my favorite character and I can make his wookie sound.
Really?  That's awesome.
I remember the first time I heard that I just laughed and laughed.
Yeah it was a  pretty hilarious part in the movie.
Do you think he is the last of his kind?
I'm not sure I would think not but I don't recall seeing anymore in the movies do you?
Me either now that you mention it.
That's kind of sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you feel like The Last Jedi will be a good one?
That's the new Star Wars, I take it?
It is. Do you think it'll be good?
Well, the last two films were solid, so I'd say it should be as well.
I'm curious to see what they're going to do with Leia's character.
Wait, she's still in it? Didn't Carrie Fisher pass recently?
Yes, she did, but she still filmed the movie beforehand. That's why I want to see what happens.
Oh. Do you think they'll send her off somehow?
I'm honestly not sure what to expect.
Understandable.I'll definitely watch to see what happens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars series of movies?
Yes, I like them all very much I am a fan.
Who are you favorite characters in the movies?
I like the Ewok in Return of the Jedi.
Yes, me too.
I like the scene where the Ewok help Han and Leia fight the Empire on Endor.
Yes, I like the cute and furry things.
When they catch Luke, Han, and Chewy it is funny.
Yes, it is.
Thankfully they finally let them all go.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your least favorite Star Wars movie?
I guess most people would say The Phantom Menace. But I feel like I should mix it up and say Attack of the Clones.
Why Attack of the Clones and not The Phantom Menace?
Sometimes The Phantom Menace almost works, since it has a child star who comes off as compelling.
And Attack of the Clones doesn't have that?
No, not at all! It was supposed to be building up to the Darth Vader story, but instead we get the worst movie love story in history.
You mean Padme and Anakin?
Yes, Padme and Anakin.
What's the worst feature of it?
The cheesy lines! George Lucas can create a world, but he can't speak to the person next to him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite movie in the Star Wars franchise?
Definitely Return of the Jedi.
That was a good one. Why is it your favorite?
I know it's dumb, but I really liked the Ewoks. Plus, it's the third in the series, and it wraps up well at the end.
I like the Ewoks too! But honestly, I like Empire Strikes Back.
Empire was good. Why was it your favorite?
I really like how they gave Princess Leia a little more airtime in that movie.
Very true, she didn't get as much attention as she should have.
I like how the newer movies give more attention to the female characters.
Me too! I can't wait for Episode 8.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like Rogue One?
I hated it.
Really? What about the last scene?
That would be an exception. That was amazing.
That's the only scene you liked?
No. Some of it was pretty good but one thing kept bugging me.
What's that?
Well aren't there supposed to be a bunch of Bothans?
Oh yeah I forgot about that.
Yeah that's why I didn't like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's you're favorite Star Wars character?
Mace Windu.
I don't remember that character, who was he played by?
Samuel L. Jackson. Who was your favorite character?
Obi wan Kenobi.
Why do you like Obi wan Kenobi?
Other than Anakin, he's the only character we get to see throughout the first two trilogies.
What do you mean by that?
He was played by Ewan McGregor in the newer episdoes and Alec Guinness in the older episodes.
Ewan McGregor does a great job of playing a young Obi wan Kenobi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Yoda a speicies or what?
I have no idea.
Perhaps he's the last of his kind.
"No family me have."
Poor little guy!
Poor little piggy?
Huh?
He was voiced by Frank Oz.
Who?
The voice of Miss Piggy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies?
Yes they are great
Whats your favorite movie?
Star wars
Are they good
Yes
Do you have a favorite star wars movie?
Return of the jedi
That sounds good
It is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you ever want to see a movie about what went on between Empire and Jedi?
Without a doubt, clearly a lot went on with Luke, and Leia, and everyone for that matter.
Besides just the healing of Luke.  Leia seemed to suddenly know a lot about Luke's powers for someone who hadn't seen them in previous movies.
And Luke seemed to have much better control over them than he had at the end of Empire.
All the Skywalker's are like that.  They have enormous power.
On that subject, I wonder how much Leia learned in the years between Jedi and the Force Awakens.
Yes, when Han died she clearly understood the force and knew how to use it.  I wonder if she carries a light saber.
That would be great if she did.  I want to see her fight.
It's sad that Carrie Fisher died, I hope they gave her a good sendoff in The Last Jedi.
I bet they did.  It is sad but her last movie is in her greatest and most well known role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rey and Fin will end up together?
I mean, I guess there is always a chance.  I think the more important question is, "should they?"
Can you elaborate?
I just think that their dynamic in 'The Force Awakens' was great without the romance.  It could maybe detract from the story.
But they have so much chemistry.
True, but I would rather they focus on the hero's journey in itself rather than romantic entanglements.
I guess I see your point.  By the way, do you think Fin will be okay after the last movie?
I'm sure he will be, but he did get severely injured.
I wouldn't be surprised if his rehabilitation takes a while.
Good point.  He may be at a disadvantage physically during the second movie of the sequel trilogy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One yet?
No, what its about?
Its about the beginnings of the death star.
Did Vader make it?
No, he was in it though.
Was he a main character?
Kind of.  He was in it a little.
Did he use the force?
Yes.  It was awesome.
I need to see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Out of all the Star Wars movies what was your favorite?
Personally I liked Episode 1.
Why do you say that?
Because I really enjoyed Jar Jar Binks.
No one likes Jar Jar, how could you?
Because I thought he was funny.
Really? He's kinda dumb.
Yea but he was suppose to be like that. He was the comic relief.
I don't think so. He was just a nuisance.
Sure, but I still think he was funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Han Solo is the best Star Wars character?
I think so. He has a really interesting arc in the first one.
I agree, the way he goes from a non caring space pirate to a friend is awesome.
Did you like him in The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes, although he did not have as big of an arc.
Yeah, the first one developed his character a lot more.
Did you like him in Return of the Jedi?
Yes, but I think they should have killed him off.
I heard that is what he wanted in the third film.
Yes, but I think someone decided it was better to keep his character alive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the most powerful Jedi from the Star Wars Movies
I think Luke Skywalker, but I guess yoi could say Anakin Skywalker too
Before Anakin turned to the dark side during Revenge of the Sith you mean?
Yes, because Darth Vader does not count as a Jedi
That makes sense, but I do think Yoda may be the most powerful
In Attack of Clones we saw him fight Count Dooku so that makes sense
Yoda was both wise and powerful, which is why he trained Luke
Obi-Wan Kenobi is underrated though, he was also very wise
Yoda and Obi-Wan together in the Empire Strikes Back were a formidible duo for Jedi training
Wait we forgot about Mace Windu
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, so, Star Wars or Star Trek?
Star Wars. I just couldn't get into the original Star Trek.
Why not?
The special effects were terrible, for one. The plots seemed kind of silly, too.
Yeah, but it was all about science and discovery and exploring issues of ethics.
That's another thing, they kept "dropping anvils", telling people what to think.
Some anvils still need to be dropped. Anyway, how aren't there any lessons to be learned from Star Wars?
Star Wars is your basic good versus evil. Simple as.
Or is it? Think about it.
Whatever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I keep hearing people say Kylo Ren is going to turn good.
I don't know about that. I think he turned to the dark side in Force Awakens and he killed his father Han Solo! I don't think you can go back after that.
That's true, but there must be something between him and Rey. Remember we still don't know what the exact relation of Rey is in terms of who her parents are.
Yeah that's something that's been pretty controversial. I don't know though, I think Kylo Ren is going to stay the villain throughout the series.
I really liked the nod to Darth Vader's mask in Force Awakens.
How about actually seeing Darth Vader do his thing in Rogue One when he took out the rebel forces on the ship!
That was so cool to see. I was expecting that all throughout the movie.
I think we'll see his spirit in the follow up to Force Awakens. I think he's going to empower Kylo Ren somehow .
I think Kylo needs it after the beating he got from Rey!
I can't wait for the next Star Wars movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that I saw the first Star Wars movie in the theater?
No way, A New Hope? That's crazy.
Yes, I went with my brother.  At the time the special effects were amazing.
The first appearance of Luke Skywalker!
i remember that Harrison Ford became a big action star.
Empire Strikes back was a better movie though.
Well, maybe.  Actually the first three were terrific.
Then the next three were horrible.  Somebody should have written out Jar Jar Binks.
Although the new series is great.  I like the appearance of the original characters.
But too bad about Carrie Fisher, and then wrote Ford out, so that's a bummer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's really messed up?
What's that?
In Revenge of the Sith where Anakin kills the children.
Oh yeah!  That was super messed up.
It was a pretty shocking scene to even film.
Right.  Even though it doesn't show it, that was his true scene to show he was evil.
I remember the theater freaked out about it.  Some people walked out.
No one did in mind, they were just stunned.
Just thinking about it makes me feel that Anakin got what he deserved.
He most certainly did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the new Star Wars movie?
You mean Rogue One?
Yeah, I loved that it had less of a focus on Jedi and more on normal people.
I thought it was pretty good. Seemed to kind of have an Ocean's Eleven feel.
Yep. I thought the same thing. I wish that they would show more of the real world in Star Wars instead of just the big events.
I had heard that at one point there was a plan to do a tv. show for Star Wars that was kind of like Band of Brothers but takes place during the Clone Wars.
That would be awesome. Rogue one introduced tons of character that could be used for something like that.
I hope the upcoming Han Solo movie has more of a Rogue One vibe than a prequel vibe.
It has to, man. Han is after all the original Rogue!
I have heard some bad rumors about it, but I am willing to reserve judgment.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Jabba the Hutt as a villain?
Oh he was excellent. I really liked the whole concept of the bounty hunters being involved.
They really are a big part of the Star Wars universe that you don't always think about.
Yeah, I mean Boba Fett is one of the most iconic characters in these movies and he barely had any screen time!
I wonder if Captain Phasma from The Force Awakens will end up with the same sort of cult following.
It's hard to say. Kind of depends on what they do with her.
I like that they used Gwendoline Christie from Game of Thrones. Adds an extra nerdy fandom element in there that makes me happy.
Yeah she's a great actress. I hope we get to see her face a little. But knowing how Star Wars works, we may not.
That's true. Also another character I liked a lot was General Hux.
I think he might be a huge first order baddie in the upcoming movie. They better give him a big role!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Yoda!
Oh, do I have to ask why?
Jedi master of THEM ALLLLLL!
True that!
Name one person that could kill yoda?
I give, you got me!
See, he's the shit!
No, man I totally agree
Cool, cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the most evil person in Star Wars?
I'd say it's between The Emperor or Darth Vader
Who is more evil between those two?
The Emperor because he likes to corrupt people
And Vader isn't that bad?
No, not at the end of his life. He does some good things
How does the Emperor corrupt people?
He offers them power and that makes some Jedi go bad
That's what happened to Anakin too, right?
Yeah, he wanted the power he needed to revenge Padme's death!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved it when Yoda fought Count Dooku!
I know - the CGI was spectacular as was Yoda's green lightsaber!
They were able to match the puppet so well with the all CGI.  Do you think that Count Dooku really knew what was going on?
I think a little bit, but that he was mostly a pawn of Darth Sidious.
Do you think that Snoke is really Darth Plageius?
Unsure - it will be interesting to see who he really is, and how he tempted Kylo and what he knows about Rey.
Do you think Luke will die in The Last Jedi?
No, I think they will keep Luke around for the final movie.
Do you think Luke will fight Snoke?
I think he and Rey have to at some point...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen the Return of the Jedi?
Many times. It is defintely one of my all time favorite movies.
Can you help explain to me why the Emperor dies when Darth Vader throws him down the shaft on the Death Star?
I've wondered that myself. It seems that the Jedi and Sith could survive almost everything.
I was thinking that exactly the same. In the Attack of the Clones, Annakin jumps out of a vehicle and falls thousands of feet.
Yes that's a great point. My only thought is that Palpatine must have ignited an explosion.
Oh right, because there is that huge blue fireball that comes back up the shaft.
Yes, so that is my thought: that he must have hit some fuel cell with his force lightning which ignited a huge explosion.
Great thanks! I was wondering why he couldn't survive a "little" fall like that.
No worries. That seems to be the best explanation that I can think of.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Star Wars, what was the name of the ship that Luke escaped in?
Do you mean the Millennium Falcon?
Yeah that was it. It has been so long since I have seen the movie.
How could you forget the Millennium Falcon?
If you think that is bad I remember that there was a tall dog looking thing and a guy but I cannot remember who they were.
How can you not remember Hans Solo and Chewbacca?
I was probably 7 or 8 the last time I saw it, that was 40 years ago.
How could you not watch Star Wars at least once every couple of years or so?
We need to wast it again.
How does next weekend sound?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite Star Wars movie character?
I like Darth Vader he is just so cool
Yeah he is a great villain, hes scary.
Whose your favorite character?
I like Han Solo I think hes pretty cool.
Yeah, too bad he died in the last Star Wars movie.
Yeah its a shame but I heard Disney is planing a Han Solo movie.
That would be awesome I wonder how this movie will play out.
I think its the beggining, how he became the Han Solo we all love.
That sounds like a must see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they will find some on to replace Carrie Fisher in the Star Wars movies.
Maybe, or they will use old footage.
Like they did in Rogue One?
Yes, showing a young Fisher.
I think they should replace the guy who played the young Anakin.
Hayden Christianson?Why?
I mean, they need to have Vader show up some how, in a flash back maybe.
I do not think they will.
Maybe in a Jedi ghost form, as they did in the Empire Strikes back.
I think the new films are trying to distance themselves from the first three episodes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi friendo
Hey there
Whatcha doing
I am watching star wars episode 3
That was such a good movie
Honestly it was one of the best in the series
Easily the best in the prequel trilogy
Overall i mean
I mean it is in the top 3 maybe not top though
Well i can agree to that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
The Empire Strikes Back id my favorite.
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Princess Leia is my favorite.
Why was she your favorite?
She showed me that women can be powerful.  She is my hero.
Who is your least favorite character?
Darth Vader of course!
Why is Darth Vader your least favorite Star Wars character?
I don't like Darth Vader because he's evil!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Episode I, II, or III?
Absolutely not!
Why not?
They were horrible movies!
What was the worst part about them?
Um. How about Jar-Jar Binks!  That was the WORST character ever!!
Worse then all of the Ewoks?
Well, good point, those were pretty bad too.
So are you sticking to Jar Jar?
Yeah, all things considered, he was pointless.  At least the Ewoks were cute!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about The Force Awakens?
I liked it a lot. I really got me excited about the Star Wars universe again after being very disappointed in the prequels.
Did you see it in the theaters when it came out?
Yes, it came out around Christmas time so I took a younger relative to see it as part of a Christmas gift. We had a lot of fun.
Did you think the story was too similar to A New Hope? That's a major complaint.
That didn't bother me too much honestly. Stars Wars is already a pretty simple and basic story and that's the charm of it.
So who's the better villain, Kylo Ren or Darth Vader?
Well we've only seen Kylo Ren in one movie so far so it's not something I can compare yet. They're both good in their own ways though and one isn't better than the other.
It was great to see Han Solo again after all these years.
It was awesome seeing Harrison Ford really get back into that role. He really nailed all the Han Solo mannerisms and really seemed to enjoy playing him again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Maybe it's just me, but I like Episodes Four, Five and Six the best.
How can you even say that!
I don't know, I just like vintage better?
It's so cheesy! And Luke's part is kind of lame.
It seems cheesy until you realize that hardly anyone had done a full length science fiction movie up to that point.
So they were pioneering the style and film techniques?
Exactly.
Okay, I can give them that.
Besides, the first three Star Wars movies filmed have Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Can't get better than that!
I guess they don't hurt anything!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello good fellow.
Hello do you like Star Wars?
Yes it's jolly good fun.
Do you find R2D2 simpatico?
Yes he's a jolly little droid.
I think he's just so clever.
I'd like to own a fine droid such as R2D2.
He is undeed one of more pleasurable aspects of the franchise.
Well said good fellow!
Jolly good show, chap!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any Star Wars in theatres?
Yes. I saw the originals.
Was it a lot different.
Yes. There were not any updates back then.
I love the originals.
Me too. They are well done.
Do you like the new ones?
Not really.
Same here. I wish they could make another great film like Star Wars
Me too. It is such a cool idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Return of the Jedi last night.
Which version?
The Blu-Ray disc, 2011.
What were some of the changes?
They added new aliens to Jabba's palace, and they replaced the Ewok song at the end.
Didn't they change the trio who appears at the end?
Yes, the Anakin from Star Wars III is shown.
What about the Sarlacc?
They added a computer generated beak.
Neat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite robot from the Star Wars series?
I've always liked R2-D2, ever since I watched The Force Awakens.
R2-D2 played such an important role by carrying the disk.
Exactly! But I also like C-3PO for his cynical humor.
Yeah, his humor cracked me up. What did you think of K-2SO in Rogue One?
I loved him! He had a similar personality to C-3PO.
I was almost in tears when he sacrificed himself in the end for Jyn and Cassian.
Same here. Sometimes I feel like the droids are the real heroes.
Tell me about it. It's amazing how much character development occurs within the robots.
It would be cool if there was a Star Wars movie that focused on the robots themselves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Revenge of the Sith was the best of the prequel?
Yeah only because we know how Anakin turns to the dark side
I wish we could have drawn it out longer
Why do you say that?
I think if we could have embraced Darth Vader as a nice guy longer it would have been better.
You mean empathize with a villain?
Yeah I wish we could have done that.
It went on for 3 movies
True but I wish it could have been another 3!
Thats way too long to make that story work
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I think episode 5 is the best.
Really? I think episode 3 is the best.
Well, 3 is good but I don't like the older movies because of the visual effects.
Well sure the effects aren't as good but the plot is way better.
Well in Episode 5 the plot and the effects are good.
That's true, plus Luke makes a better protagonist than Anniken
Exactly! Aniken kind of sucked as a protagonist. He's a better villian.
Darth Vader is pretty cool. It's a shame he actually dies in the sixth episode.
Yeah, maybe he'll make a comback for revenge.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars, the original, had a lot of ground-breaking special effects.
Yes, it was a real feast for the eyes.
It deserved all those craft Oscars it won.
Too bad that was back in the day when the Academy never took scii-fi seriously enough to give it a Best Picture Oscar.
Maybe the Academy was still ticked off that George Lucas refused to put any credits at the beginning like the Academy wanted.
That was a really big deal back then, wasn't it? Like Lucas broke some kind of sacred Academy rule?
I think so. They had such a row that Lucas resigned from the Academy.
Not a good look for the Academy, chasing away a premier filmmaker of the day.
The Academy has always been pretty stuffy and stodgy. Hard to get new blood in there.
Things seem to be changing nowadays, with novel wins for unusual projects. They still need to recognize more sci-fi though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie has your favorite opening crawl text?
I really like the first line from The Force Awakens.
Yeah, me too - it was very exciting and set the stage for trying to find Luke Skywalker.
I wonder how many drafts of Star Wars crawls they go through.
Are you a fan of Boba Fett?
Absolutely - I wonder sometimes if he survived the Sarlaac Pit and they will bring him back.
It would be a stretch, but perhaps Boba Fett could make some sort of cameo.
I always liked his ship too in The Empire Strikes Back.
The X-wing fighter remains my favorite ship.
Yes, the Death Star trench run from the 1977 Star Wars was pretty epic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen star wars?
The new ones, you mean?
No, I mean the real star wars, the ones from back in the day.
Oh, so like Return of the Jedi and stuff?
Yea, those ones, have you seen them?
No, they look really cheesy.
Of course, they are cheesy, they are 30 years old.
Well, that's why I haven't seen them.
You're missing out, the characters were much cooler back then.
If you say so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen star wars
Yes
I loved carrie fisher in the movies
She is a great actress
She is
Perfect for princess leia
I know
Im really glad they cast her
Me too
Shes wonderful
XXXXXXXXXXX
Luke didn't need training to use the Force. He needed training to avoid falling to the Dark Side. That was what the entire cave scene was about.
It surely sounded like Yoda and Obi-Wan wanted him to kill Palpatine in a big fight.
Sure, they did. But it wasn't enough for him to fight. He had to fight for the right reasons. Fighting out of anger would have damned him.  That was the entire point.
Then why did Yoda tell him that his training was over?
Because Yoda was dying and Luke needed the confidence.  It was a dumbo feather.
That seems like a big risk.
Oh, it was.  Yoda didn't have any choice, though.  There was a good chance that Luke would have fallen but he was their only hope.
There was Leia, too.
She wasn't really capable of fighting Luke, though.  And she'd have even less training.  She'd have fallen in a second.
That might be an interesting alternate universe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in all of the star wars movies
Goi Gon Ginn
he was really good but short lived
yes but I think he brought a depth to episode 1
I dont see how anyone could disagree with that
he tried to help everyone
i did like that about him
Liem Neeson did a great job on that character
yes I agree no one else could have done such a bang up job for the character
he is the bomb
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the movie"Revenge of the Sith", when Darth Vader fought Yoda?
Yes, I saw that episode, Yoda kick his but.
The Darth Sidious was trying to fight Yoda because he thought he could beat him, but he was wrong.
Yeah, Darth Sideous is no match for Yoda.
Did you like the episode in Star Wars III when Obi- Wan VS General Grievous?
Yeah! that was cool.
Obi-Wan beat his butt.
I could not believe when Anakin Skywalker fought Obi-Wan, shocking.
I have to see the movie again I forgot what happened to Obi-Wan.
I will be going to see "Stars Wars 8" as soon as it comes out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Star Wars heroine?
I don't think that any actress can top Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, but I have enjoyed the new female leads too.
Yeah, Daisy Ridley's portrayal of Rey in the new movies has been really good I think.
For sure, she's a great actress and fits the Jedi role perfectly. She's tough and likable at the same time.
I really enjoyed the relationship between Rey and Finn as well. Can't wait to see where that leads.
I know right, December can't come fast enough! I can't wait for the new movie.
What about Natalie Portman? What did you think about her as Anakin's love interest?
She was ok. The Star Wars movies that she was in were not my favorite, but she wasn't bad.
Yeah, my thoughts as well. Rey is my favorite new female lead, but Princess Leia will always be top of the list!
All this talk of Star Wars characters makes me want to have movie marathon this weekend and watch them all again!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?
I've seen the first 3.
The original 3 or the first 3 in the series.
What are you talking about?
The first 3 are actually number 4, 5, and 6 in the series.
What are 1, 2, and 3?
Those are the ones that were released in the 2000s.
Wait so the order of Star Wars goes 4,5,6,1,2, and 3?
Yeah according to George Lucas.
Thank god, Disney bought Star Wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever wonder if anyone from the Star Wars universe ever made it to our galaxy?
Not really, that was a long time ago.
Good point. Do you think they could ever do a cross over between Star Trek and Star Wars?
No, they occupy totally different timelines.
Oh good point. Do you think we will see Jar Jar Binks in another movie?
There's no way, that was the worst character of all time.
What is your favorite star wars character?
My favorite is Admiral Akbar, he's got a lot of subtle depth.
That's interesting, my favorite character is Lando Calrissian.
But that guy is a total double crosser, why?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is why some people are claiming Jar Jar is Plagueis/Hadu who trained Snoke.
This is insane. Some people literally have way too much time on their hands.
Well, it's an interesting theory. While Jar Jar was ostracized from Gungan and fled to Naboo, he befriends a kid who has a scar on his face from his jaw all the way up to his scalp.
Whoa dude. That's just like Snoke...
Yes. and Jar Jar promises to teach the kid saying "My teachin yousa, pallo. Wesa maken the whole galaxy smilin, huh?"
That story line needed to be followed up on.
Yep, but they never did. And it was left out in a limbo, but was it?
Maybe as a hint. You know, to make people go crazy making these stupid conspiracy theories.
And we do have some crazy theories all over the internet about it
Some guy at reddit had this one post claiming Jar Jar IS Snoke. i didn't believe it though. But it was documented so thoroughly. it was hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the clone wars?
Yes it was pretty good
Its my favorite
When did it come out?
2008
It had a great cast
Yes it was one of the better ones
Have you seen all of them
Yes have you
Yes
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that one of Vader's bounty hunters was stolen from Dr. Who?
No way!
Yup. Bossk.
Which one was that?
The lizard looking guy.
Hmmm. Don't recall.
Well, if you watch it again, look for him.
Will do.
Niffty piece of trivia, huh?
Yes, sir!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie has the best lightsaber fight?
The Empire Strikes Back
You like that one better than the one with Ben Kenobi in the first one?
Yes. it has a deeper significance.
That is true and it is better choreographed.
Did you like when Luke got his hand cut off?
That was a big surprise.
I did not think it would end with such a big surprise.
Yes. I had no idea Vader would turn out to be his father.
That movie is full of surprises.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back?
They're both great, that's like asking me to pick my favorite child.
Well if you absolutely had to choose one, which of those is better?
Okay I would say Empire Strikes Back is the better of the two but they're both excellent.
Why do you prefer Empire Strikes Back over A New Hope?
Well, there's just so many memorable scenes. There are also a lot of beloved characters that make their debut in Episode Five.
What new characters from Empire Strikes back did you like?
Well you have to go with the introduction of Yoda obviously. When Luke travels to Dagobah to find Yoda, that's an extremely entertaining part of the movie.
It was fun seeing Luke expecting to find what he thought a powerful Jedi would be only to discover that this small little creature was actually him.
Yeah Yoda was hilarious. Also, the actual puppet used for Yoda looked really good, much better than the CGI versions of Yoda in later movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the ending of Return of the Jedi?
Not really
Why?
It was too happy
Good point. I would have liked a better ending
It should have been more depressing and cool
I agree.
They should have killed off at least one of the main characters
Yes.
I did like the beginning though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey you haven't seen the new Star Wars movie have you.
Nope. That last trilogy killed all the Star Wars love in me.
Come on, really? You didnt like the action in them?
Yea Darth Maul was pretty much the best thing about them and he got cut in two in the first movie.
Agreed, but still they look amazing and there's alot of awesome characters. Like General uh what's his name? half robot half...
..Grevious.
Haha. You knew his name! You do love everything Star Wars! Even the sequels!
OK. Ok. But they really pissed me off with all the plot junk. Where's the emotion? Not in the horrible romance between Anakin and Natalie Portman...
..Princess Amidala
..whatever..But yea you're right- they can be enjoyed for just the shear action. Dump the rest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, have you seen the Star Wars movies?
You mean the new ones or the old ones?
The new ones in theaters.
Yeah! I saw Force Awakens, but I haven't seen Rogue One.
Oh! You have to watch Rogue One.
Well I didn't really like Force Awakens.
What! How couldn't you. It was so good?
I guess I've never been a die hard Star Wars fan.
Me neither but trust me, it gets good at Rogue One.
Okay, let's watch it some time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was always a Luke and Leia shipper.
They're siblings. I don't think that would work out.
They weren't originally siblings.  In the draft script of Empire Strikes Back, Luke had a completely different sister.
It does come out of left field.
Exactly. The revelation makes little sense given what came before. It was just a neat way to end the love triangle.
It wasn't really necessary, though.  I mean, plenty of love triangles end without such revelations.
I think Lucas just wanted Luke to have a sister. I suspect the idea was that she could become a Jedi and appear in sequels.
If only he had done those sequels, instead of waiting so long.
I think a Lucas helmed sequel trilogy in the 90s would have been great.
It would have meant no prequels, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What order should I watch these movies in?
Star Wars?
Yeah, I've heard there are a few ways to do it.
Well, there are a couple ideas. I'm traditionalist though. Old then new.
Hmm. So I shouldn't start with the prequels?
I don't think you need to. Some people like watching the old one after one or two though. As a flashback.
Why would they do that?
To keep the reveal of Vader being Anakin a surprise.
Oh. I guess that would be a surprise if you hadn't seen the prequels.
Exactly. It's a little more fun that way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who I wish was still in the Star Wars movies?
Who?
Boba Fett! He was always my favorite as a child. I was so bummed out when he got eaten by the Sarlacc Pit in "Return of the Jedi."
Oh yeah, he was everyone's favorite back then I think. Such a cool character, even though he wasn't exactly a good guy.
No, he wasn't, but I always found the bounty hunter characters pretty fascinating.
How so?
Well, they were such gray characters. They weren't Sith but they weren't rebels either. They acted only on what would give them the most benefit, and money of course.
Yeah, getting Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt was a huge achievement for Boba Fett.
Yeah, he got the biggest bounty of his career and then died in the same movie, what a bad stroke of luck!
You can say that again!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite character in the Star Wars movies?
That's a tough question, I've gotta go with Darth Vader.
Why is Darth Vader your favorite?
Because he's completely amazing and powerful.
Any other reason why you like him?
Well he has such an amazing back story.
Oh? So you really liked Star Wars Episode III?
Absolutely! However even the whole backstory of how vader came to be was amazing.
It really was, but don't you like 4,5, and 6?
Well of course I do, they were all amazing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was little I used to have nightmares about Darth Vader.
From Star Wars? Really?
Yes. He strangled someone using his mind.
I know! He was awesome!
You don't find that concept disturbing?
I guess it is. But he was an amazing swordfighter.
I heard a famous swordfighter did his scenes with the lightsaber.
My favorite character on the series was Leia Organa.
I didn't know her last name was Organa. She sounds like a character from Bewitched.
I know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Star Wars prequels?
Well, they were OK.  Not great, but they are better when you watch them a second time.
They're better when you watch them at home for free and not having to wait in line to be disasppointed.
Totally!  I liked Revenge of the Sith!
I did too. I also really liked Natalie Portman.
I agree.  I feel like the female charcters in the movies are some of the best.
Yeah, it was kinda awesome for Princes Leia to grow up to be a general.
And not just following around Hans Solo.
Are you looking forward to the new movie?
Yes.  I hope there will be ewoks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did you see the preview for The Last Jedi?
Yes, that was awesome.  It's going to be a great movie.
Do you think they'll tell us who Rey's parents are?
I do, but my theory is a little bit different.  I think she gets her Jedi blood from the Kenobi blood line.
That would be amazing!  And a surprise.  What about Snoke?
I would love to see who he is.  Maybe he's someone we already know.
I heard a theory that it could be Mace Windu.
That would be great, he exited way too easy.
For the heck of it bring back Darth Maul too.
I'm not sure about that.  He was cool but lets not be too far fetched.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of "Revenge of The Jedi"?
I don't know, I was soured once mark Hamill "made a hamburger of his face".
Huh? What do you mean?
Hamill was in a car accident in California, and had to have plastic surgery to get his face back together. After that, he seemed to have a lisp.
Really??? I never knew that.
I noticed, but he was really great playing Luke to Jim Henson's Yoda. I also like the fun in Jabba The Hut's hideaway.
I liked the battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. How could you not?
Yes, you're right. It's so exciting!
I can't wait for the new film. It's supposed to have lots more of Luke in it.
Yes! It's supposed to be called "The Last Jedi", and  I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's this weird thing in the Star Wars prequels no one ever talks about. It's about the Chancellorship.
What about the Chancellorship?
So, in Episode I Chancellor Valorum gets voted out, and Palpatine is voted into office, right?
So what's wrong with that? Besides him being a Sith Lord, I mean.
Well, the weird thing is that Mas Amedda, who was Valorum's Vice Chancellor, stays on as Palpatine's Vice as well.
That would be like if Dick Cheney stayed on as Vice President to Barack Obama. That is weird.
Yeah, and no one questioned it really. Except the Jedi eventually.
Why did the Jedi care?
I don't know if it's canon anymore or not, but they thought it was a little weird, and figured he was the Sith Lord behind the war.
It would make sense, seeing how he was able to maintain power under two administrations. Too bad they were all wrong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
Which version do you mean?
To me there's only one version, the original.
Well I've seen the ones that just came out, how about you?
Those are phony. The ones from the eighties are the best.
You mean the original and then like The Empire Strikes Back?
The first three, including those two and Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, I think Yoda was the coolest.
The ones after the first three I think they were just doing too much.
Yeah, who does a trilogy prequel? Doesn't make sense to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars series?
My favorite character is Han Solo.
I can understand that. It's pretty amazing all of the stuff he gets away with in the Millennium Falcon.
I am really glad that Luke turned out to be Leia's brother so that she could end up with Han instead.
It's kind of strange that his best friend is Chewbaka.
I'm not really sure how Han and Chewy carry on conversations, but I think they are cute together.
I'm so glad that Harrison Ford has lived long enough to continue to play Han Solo in the newer movies.
I completely agree. I will be so upset when he dies. I cried and screamed in the theater when Han was killed.
It's pretty terrible that his son, Kylo Ren killed him like that.
It was absolutely horrible! I hope Kylo Ren gets what is coming to him in the next movie. He needs to be punished!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are Star Wars movies just science fiction?
No, they have fantasy elements too. The Force is basically just magic.
That's what I thought, too. Yoda might as well be an elf.
Yoda's not an elf, though.
He's a pointy-eared wise, mystical person who lives in harmony with nature. If this were Lord of the Rings, he'd be an elf.
I never thought about it that way.
Obi-Wan Kenobi was originally inspired by a ronin samurai, too.
Jedi own their lightsabers like fantasy knights own swords.
So Star Wars seems like it's just as much a fantasy as a science-fiction movie.
I never thought about it that way. But you're right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the upcoming Star War movies will be as good as the original trilogy?
I think it's on track to be.
The Force Awakens was great.
I'm excited for The Last Jedi.
What do you think you think or the prequels?
I think that they're important but not as good as the other movies.
To be fair the bar was set very high.
They recovered and the future seems bright.
I love that they're bringing back the original characters from the first movies like Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.
I might cry when I see Carrie Fisher in her last Star Wars movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What part of Star Wars stick with you?
The first shot of X-wings diving toward the Death Star as that fanfare plays.
A good thought, the finale of Episode four.
Yes, another for me was the Victory Celbration at the end of four.
A down point for me was six. The Ewoks was to get an even younger audience involved.
True, that was dissapointing.
Whtn Episode One came out i was elated! Two was even better.
What did you like about two?
Well, just the city life...... it kinda reminded me of Washington DC in the 60's. Super large living spaces, large living room windows.
I thought that as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like the movie where the villain has a red face.
Are you talking about Darth Maul?
I think that is his name.
He first appears in The Phantom Menace.
Yup, that is the one I like.
It is pretty good, not my favorite though.
What one is your favorite?
I like Return of the Jedi.
I have not seen that one yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was the Millennium Falcon not the coolest ship ever?
At the time I would have agree with you
So you think it is dated?
No I mean if Star Wars was created nowadays I think it would look so much cooler
Could you see Han Solo being a better pilot?
No I dont think his kind of ship would matter.
I think it would take the Death Star on in a more immediate fashion
I dont think that rings true.
I Would like to see it have more technology
I think for the time period it was just OK
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man i am still shocked they did that
Did what?
In the last main star wars they shocked me
How did they shock you
They killed of Solo
Oh yeah
They had his own blood kill him off it was just shocking
Yeah that was something you would not have seen coming
I was legit shook when i first saw it
Same man same
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Gotta go with Hon Solo
Okay, I agree.  hon is the man!
Yea with the millenium Falcon!
Yea, that ship is old, but it packs a punch!
Yea, and one of the few things to make it through allllll of those movies
Yea, that ship just keeps coming back!
I know just what you mean!
Same page, bro!
Cool, cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the most annoying person in Star Wars?
I'm thinking of someone but I don't know if he's really a person
Are you thinking of Jar Jar Binks?
Yeah, that's exactly who I'm thinking of!
What don't you like about him?
He is the weirdest person ever, I hate his voice
I think it is kind of funny, he is just comic relief
I just don't find him funny
At least admit he is unique and a good fihgter in the first movies
Okay, I don't really hate him but I think his character was very silly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the original Star Wars trilogy was your favorite?
I definitely think Empire Strikes back was my favorite because it was so dark.
I liked that about Empire Strikes back too. The way it didn't have a happy ending.
The reveal of Vader as being Luke's father was astonishing. I remember seeing that and was simply shocked.
I think it was such a defining moment in the Star Wars Trilogy.
Did you enjoy Return of the Jedi more than Star Wars though?
I would rank the trilogy as Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and then Star Wars. It's not to say Star Wars was bad it was more of a set up.
I think a lot of people ranked Star Wars over Return of the Jedi because they didn't like the Ewoks.
That's ridiculous the Ewoks were cute and so cool. They helped the rebellion fight during that whole battle of Endor.
Oh I'm not disagreeing just mentioning what most people think of the ranking of the series. I loved the Ewoks too. We need to see them return in future Star Wars!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Star Wars Villain?
Is there any other answer than Darth Vader?
Yes, I liked Darth maul the most.
What?! Darth Vader is iconic, Darth Maul is already forgotten about.
He is not! People still dress up like him for Halloween.
Yea, but it's been what, 10 years since his movies have come out?
Yea, so what?
Well its been over 40 for the original trilogy.
I don't see your point.
My point is, even after 40 years people still dress like Darth Vader, they wont be of Darth Maul in 2040.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars?
Yes i love star wars
I really enjoy carrie fisher in star wars
She is a great actress
Perfect for the part of propincess leia
She is
That was a great casting choice
I love the story line too
Me too
I cant get enough
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey friendo
Hey man whats up
nothing really i got a question
Sure go ahead and shoot it at me
Well it is star wars you good on that
Sure man
Well do you think Lucas was good or bad for the franchise
I actually think he was bad for it
I like his ideas myself
Why do you like his ideas?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Star Wars music?
I think it's great, John Williams is a genius.
Yes I know, it really sets the mood of a space drama.
How do you feel about the death of Han Solo?
I feel it was necessary even though very sad.
Do you think this is because Harrison Ford didn't want to make any more movies?
I am not sure about that, but definitely think it was pertinent to the plot.
Do you think that Kylo Ren is going to become less evil?
I think since he is of a lineage of good and evil he may turn around.
He is related to Darth Vader so not sure will have to see!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My brother's favorite character is Lando.
Really?  He's not very memorable in my opinion.
Lando is cool though.  Fast talking guy, can get out of a situation easily.
There's already someone like that called Han Solo.
Yeah, but where do you think Han learned it from?
Lando also stabbed them in the back and basically got Han frozen.
He didn't mean to, he didn't have a choice.
He did have a choice and he screwed it up.
He helped get him free eventually though, don't forget about that.
Yeah, but who wants to be frozen in carbonite?  Lando has lots of blame for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character from Star War?
My favorite would be Yoda because of his intelligence and the way he talks. What is yours?
My favorite is Darth Vader because of his power and I love James Earl Jones.
Yeah Vader is pretty cool did you watch Rogue One? The movie was pretty sweet!
Yes! My eyes lit up when Vader first came on the screen.
My favorite character from the movie was K-2SO he was funny.
He was real funny, I loved it when Jyn shot the other droid and he asked her if she knew she didn't shoot him.
That was priceless.
Are  you ready or the next one to come out?
I an hardly wait, I think its the last Jedi right? The last one with Carrie fisher, may she rest in peace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any movie insights or unknown star wars trivia?
Well A little bit, I know some of the backstory of the original scripts.
Like what? Please do share.
Well George's script was originally way too long so he cut the  final two acts and gave the first act of the screenplay as a whole story for star wars.
I did not know that.
Ya, the other two acts got made into The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
Wow that would have been way too much story line for one film.
Yes, agreed,I am glad they split it up. They would have had to cut out so much content.
I think everything happens for a reason, so happy it worked out the way it did.
Yes for sure a" force"  behind everything!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Return of the Jedi
Yes I love the entire movie.
What is your favorite character?
The Ewoks
Why did you like the Ewoks?
They were so cute and they helped the Alliance win the battle.
Can you believe that Han was kidnapped?
No it was crazy his best friend turning on him like that.
What is you favorite scene?
The victory scene on Endor. It touched hearts all over the world.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I love Han Solo.
I do like his side kick, Chewbacca.
The Wookies are amazing characters.
What planet do they live on?
Kashyyk.
Isn't that the planet Yoda escaped from?
Yes. One of the Wookies escorted him to a pod.
Where did he end up?
On a planet in the Degobah system.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I really like Palpatine.
You mean the Emperor?!
Yes, well I really like him as both Emperor and Senator. I find him compelling.
Just the acting, or the character himself?
Both! He's a great actor, and the character has such great nuance.
Nuance? Such as what?
Well, he's this really good politician and evil Jedi, but he is also really sympathetic.
What's his most sympathetic moment?
I was really impressed by when he argued that the force must be balanced.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hated the first Star Wars.
Wasn't that like episode 4?
Dont confuse me. The first one with Luke and Han in it.
Yeah, why not, it's a classc.
Darth Vader was cool and all but a little dorky looking. I wanted a real science fiction film.
What? Dude are you nuts?
I'm not nuts. Luke was a fork. The acting was stupid and the story moreso.
You're just bitter dude.
I'm not bitter, I have taste.
If you dont like Star Wars what do you like?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know the Star Wars series is about good versus evil don't you?
Get out! I thought it was a coming of age movie for Luke Skywalker.
A movie can have more than one theme. In the first Star Wars movie Luke Skywalker learns that Darth Vader is his father.
Yeah, James Earl Jones did Darth Vader's voice justice. It seems like that role was written for him.
Does Stars Wars movies seem like the Indiana Jones movies that takes place in the sky galaxy?
Yeah except Harrison Ford played a whole lot older Indiana Jones than he did play a young Luke Skywalker.
I like how George Lucas uses android robots in his Star Wars series.
R2d2 reminds of Cousin It in the old school series Adams Family. (laughs)
I think Carrie Fisher  made a great Princess Leah didn't you? I wished they would have changed her hair though.
Lucas had to have a woman who could handle he own in the galaxy. I'm going to Carris Fisher in the future Star Wars movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you interested in Star Wars at all?
Any true American has at least seen Star Wars, and I am a true American.
Have you seen all of the movies?
Yes, but I like the older ones the best.
Which one is your favorite?
I like The Empire Strikes Back.
I love that one too.  i especially love Yoda.
Yoda is awesome!
Yea.  He is so wise and knows how to help Luke become a Jedi.  I think there are life lessons in the Star Wars movies.
I know what you mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about movies
Sounds good to me
Do you like star wars?
I havent seen any of the movies
You are missing out
So you like them?
Yes, definitely
Have you seen all of them
Yes, i love them
I should check them out
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Han Solo's and Princess Leia's son?
Kalo Ren?  He was okay.
I liked his light saber and his helmet.
I didn't like his room.  Particularly the belt in the middle.
I liked captain phasma's look.
Yeah, interesting to see a silver colored storm trooper.
I like all the little robots.
Yeah, it's interesting that they can make robots have personalities.
Are you going to see the new one in December?
Of course!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the first time you saw Star Wars?
I saw Return of the Jedi at the drive-in when it was first released, and from there I was hooked.
That's funny.  Me too!
I begged my parents to let me see all three movies and I tried to buy all things Star Wars.
What did you like so much?
It was the characters, the setting, the plot, the epic-ness of the whole thing.  I had never seen a movie like it in my life.
I felt the same way.  I used to pretend I was Luke Skywalker coming to rescue everyone.
I used to try to perform Jedi mind tricks on everyone.
Hahaha.  Did it ever work.
Unfortunately, no.  The force is not strong in me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Boba Fett in the Star Wars movies?
I thought that Boba Fett was really cool!
His outfit was awesome!
It was! I like that he had a jet pack.
It sucks that he went into that one pit.
I know! I wonder if he is still alive.
He probably is.
I think that pit takes 1000 years or something to digest.
I hope someone came back and gave him a rope.
I wish that happened!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that The Last Jedi is going to repeat The Empire Strikes Back?
I'm not sure. What makes you think that?
The trailer seems to share imagery with that movie.
Oh, did you mean the AT-AT battle portion?
Yeah. That's one part.
I don't think that it is going to be the same.
Who is your favorite character out of all of the movies?
Emperor Palpatine is a great villain, but I'd have to go with Luke.
Agreed. However, I kind of hate what they did to him in The Force Awakens.
What should they have done?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Star Wars at the theater in 1977!
Wow, you must be pretty old.
It was a great, eye opening movie.
Who was your favorite actor or actress?
I loved Alec Guinness.  He gave a dignified performance.
Who's he?
He was a great British actor.
Did you like anyone else?
I've loved Harrison Ford ever since he was in American Graffiti.
I never saw that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You hear?
Hear what?
Changed directors for the Han Solo film
Why did they do that
I have no clue
Is it bad
Well i got no faith this new guy can do it
Why
He is nothing compared to who they had before
Give him a chance though
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard an interesting thing about the Star Wars movies?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Well, Star Wars really is just one big family messing up the universe?
Why's that?
Well, there's the Skywalker's. And then there's Darth Vader who's the father.
Right! And then Anakin, Darth Maul, even Kylo Ren.
Exactly all the heroes and villains are just one big family.
Yeah, that makes sense.
And without this family, including the heroes, the universe would be much more peaceful.
Skywalker Star Wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want a Separatist Star Wars film. There I said it.
Like with Count Dooku or General Grievous or something?
Sure, it could be about them. Or it could be about the Separatists who held out and kept fighting after the Clone Wars were over.
Sort of like those Japanese soliders who kept fighting after World War II ended?
Yeah. It could take place between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, and show their futile fight for their beliefs in separatism.
I suppose it is hard to believe that an army that managed to conquer half the galaxy would disappear overnight.
Exactly, the Confederacy of Independent systems had a lot of support. Even without the droid armies I'm sure some people would keep on swinging.
Well, it's good to want things. I don't think we'll ever see that movie, though.
And that's fine, I would also take a General Grievous or Count Dooku film. Maybe showing what they were up to before Episode II.
Like I said, it's good to want things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy Rogue One?
I did enjoy the new movie.
I loved Jyn.
I think it's great that they're showing more female characters.
She reminds me of Rey!
I wish Jyn and Rey could've met in one of the movies.
That would be an interesting interaction!
They could talk about fighting the Sith.
Only Jyn never met a Sith Jedi!
True, but they both fought villains.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think it's weird that a lightsaber training device just happened to aboard the Millennium Falcon in Ep. 4?
That floating orb that popped Luke a couple of times?
Yeah man, Han says that he doesn't believe in the force yet this device just happens to be on the ship.
Maybe it was a leftover relic from a smuggling operation.
You know that could be. I never thought about that.
Is there a mandatory sentence minimum for Star Wars smugglers?
I bet it depends on the cargo.
Is there an Imperial jail somewhere? Now that is something I would like to see.
If you think about it the Death Star is like a flying jail. I mean where are you going to go?
I guess Vader was the first Imperial jail warden.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Roque One
I thought it was pretty awesome
Yeah, it was really good, even thought you knew the end game.
They, based on the original movies you know everyone dies, but it was still good.
Did you like "The Force Awakens" also
Yes, they finally got back to what Star Wars really is.
I liked most of it.  Parts of it were stupid.
Which parts were that?
When the girl, who didn't know she was a Jedi and had never trained, beat up Kylo Ren
Yeah, that part was a little lame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Queen Amidala in Star Wars?
Loved her! She was a wonderful female character.
I thought so too.
Great to think a culture would vote in a young woman like that, to be a queen.
Their whole society was really beautiful and fantastic.
Yeah I loved the artwork they used to represent their capital city.
I think those must have been paintings.
First class art.  What did you think of Natalie Portman's costumes?
Crazy beautiful right?  I totally loved them.
Me too.  Some of those headresses made my jaw drop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Phantom Menance?
I loved it!  I think the prequels have a lot of depth.
Oh I hated it! I thought it was so boring.
But you get so much background! And Yoda is so great!
I don't watch Star Wars for Yoda!
But he's awesome!
Yeah, but I watch it for the Skywalker family stuff.
Then what about Anikan and Padame?
Super creepy because she's a teenager and he's a kid!
Eh. Maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe they killed off Hans Solo?
Yeah what a major surprise!
Wonder why they did it?
I think for a few reasons.
Which are...
Kylo Ren gets positioned as a villain.
Mmm hmm. What else?
The new trilogy can go in a different direction.
That'll be interesting.
Plus maybe Harrison Ford was done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Clone Wars?
That was episode two, right?
I liked the romance aspect of it.
Between Anakin and Padme?
Yes, I liked the way he always loved her.
You did not think it was gross Padme was so much older than him?
She was not that much older than him.
I think four years, but she knew him as a kid.
But, she was young then too. They had always loved each other, just not in the same sense.
I wish they would have let her live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think will happen in the new Star Wars movie, the Last Jedi?
I don't know, but I'm happy to see Luke Skywalker back in action. I think they'll kill Leia off screen as a result of Carrie Fisher's death too.
Did you like Rogue One?
I did, I really enjoyed seeing a story not focus on the Jedi and instead on the more regular people. It felt like a war movie.
Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars Universe?
I really like Han Solo. Harrison Ford is a good actor and Solo has those rogueish qualities that I really like.
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I think it has to be Empire Strikes Back. It's one of the more focused and dramatic stories, and the Darth Vader scenes are fantastic and full of suspense.
Do you enjoy the Star Wars prequels?
I think there are some things that the movies do well, but that the dialogue and story aren't good enough to watch as an adult.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you a Star Wars fan?
Somewhat, I remember watching the original movies on VHS when I was a little kid.
I haven't gotten into the new ones as much, but the original trilogy is an all time classic.
For sure, think about how many recognizable characters there are, from Chewbaca to R2D2 to Darth Vader.
And saying something like "the force" and everyone immediately knows what you're talking about.
My favorite part is the concept of something as powerful as a death star, and yet they are able to defeat it somehow.
I loved the light saber fighting. We used to play like that when we were kids.
Me too, the whole idea of being in outer space and fighting an evil empire is super fun.
It's funny, the people who played that way as kids still dress up like that to see new Star Wars movies.
Good point, it's a lifelong following.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Empire Strikes Back.
That was my least favorite.
I agree.  Nothing much happens in the movie.
What was your favorite scene?
When they froze Han Solo.
Jabba was ruthless there.
I also liked the fighting in the snow.
Those white uniforms were cool.
I think the Yoda stuff was cool.
Yes, humorous but dramatic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just heard that george lucas's inspiration for darth vader came to him out of nowhere.
What do you mean?
The name for the character just came to him, out of thin air.
I find that surprising because it has so much meaning.
Now I ask what do you mean by meaning?
Well Darth is a way of saying of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's Dark Father.
That is crazy accurate for the role!
Yes, it seems like a lot of research and thought would have gone into that name.
Well apparently not at all!
That makes me love star wars franchise even more! The force is strong!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the new star wars movie Force awakens?
I did but it felt like it was stealing from previous films plots.
I can see where you are coming from but all movies will be loosely based on each other.
I agree. How about Rogue one?
Oh i loved learning of how they got the plans for the Death star.
Yeah even with some of the stories being changed a bit I really liked the story.
Yeah Felicity Jones was perfect in that movie
And seeing darth vader at the end was awesome!
Oh yeah! him just going berzerker on everyone was awesome!
Yep and seeing Carrie Fisher at the end was great
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the droids in Star Wars?
Some of them. I like BB-8 and R2D2
What about C-3PO?
I find him very annoying
Really? He's one of the major stars of the show.
Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be Star Wars without them.
Aren't they in every single one?
I believe so. Some more than others.
Yeah, they're like a continuity piece for every single film.
I thought BB-8 was really fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they'll bring Leia back?
Only if they already have the footage.
Why do you say that?
The Fisher Estate won't allow it.
Huh?
They won't allow any electronic recreation of her image.
Sad.
So, I hope they already filmed her.
Me too.
Knowing Disney, They probably already have the other two movies in the can.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they will make a show
Based on what
The current episde
Like with the new characters
Yeah that would be pretty rad
I think it would be too
I know right
Well we can hope
Well that is what we shall do
Yes it is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
That's a hard question,  but I think it is Return of the Jedi
Oh really?  Why did you like that one?
I liked how they were able to redeem Darth Vader's character.
Ha ha I thought you were going to say it was because of the Ewoks.
Well they are adorable, but seeing Vader with Obi Wan and Yoda at the end was wonderful
Yeah especially after learning the backstory in the prequels it is nice to have him back on the light side.
So do you agree that Return of the Jedi is best?
No I think that the Empire Strikes Back is really the movie where we get to know the characters including Vader and that development is what made the story matter.
At least we agree that the best movies are in the original trilogy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you think is the worst character of all time in Star Wars?
Man, that's easy it has to be Jar Jar Binks.
I can see where you would think that he is the worst one but I have to disagree I would think that Jabba The Hut is the worst.
What? Man you are crazy Jabba the Hut is one of the best characters in Star Wars,
How do you figure that, he's just a big blob of jello that cannot even speak english.
He's like the Tony Soprano of Star Wars, he cannot even move and people and aliens fear him
Okay I can see where you are coming from and I do agree that Jar Jar is a tool
Exactly he runs around like a chicken with his head cut off and doesn't really contribute except by accident
Maybe I should have asked what your favorite character was instead lol
Oh well there is always next time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new fan theories about Rey from Force Awakens.
I've seen some really good ones.
So who do you think her father is?
Personally, I'm betting it's Han Solo.
Oh, and Kylo Ren is her brother?
Yeah. Who do you think her father is?
I'm thinking it's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Oh really? Why him?
I think the ages could work and they both have that accent...
That makes sense if the accents are purposefully kept to show familial relations. We'll have to wait to find out though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part of The Force Awakens?
For me, it was the cinematography. Every shot in the movie felt like it was a work of art.
The effects were beautiful, too.
What about the plot?
I liked that the early scenes with Rey took their time.
That felt like showing Luke on Tatooine in A New Hope.
They were wise not to make it purely an action movie without that kind of scene.
It did make The Force Awakens pretty long, though.
But that kind of development will pay off later.
Agreed. Without it, we won't be able to appreciate where the characters go in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope Rey isn't related to Luke or Han or Leia, like it was rumored.
Why do you say that?
Because it feels like everything that happens in Star Wars revolves around those three.
So you'd like to see more original characters?
Yes. I'd like to at least have them acknowledge there are more than three people in the setting who do anything.
In Rogue One, all of the characters were new.
Rogue One was a really refreshing movie because of that.
It was depressing, though. They all died in the end!
They sacrificed themselves for the Rebellion - as do many in the original movies.
That's true. It served a wonderful thematic purpose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you want to talk about
How aboit movies
Okay that sounds good
Do you have a favorite movie?
I love the star wars series
I havent seen it
Its really good
I need to check it out
You should
I will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey
Whats up?
Not much.
What stars wars movie is your least favorite?
That is an interesting question.
Take your time.
I would probably say the first prequel.
Yeah that one is pretty bad.
Young Anakin always gets on my nerves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who's your favorite droid?
i'm a huge fan of BB8
really? straight for the newest droid!h
hey, he's not the newest! KS0 is
you got me there...
what's your favorite, anyway?
c3P0
the worst droid!
the smartest droid. he's always keeping everyone out of trouble
nah, he's just always whining
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me the Star Wars movies you have seen recently.
I saw the second one.
Oh yeah was that any good do you think?
I enjoyed it.
How was the relationship between anakin and the princess?
They were very cute together.
It seemed very futuristic, don't you think?
Definitely.
We should watch the others sometime.
For sure!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue one?
Yeah it's not one of my favorites from the Franchise.
I know what you mean, it was good though.
Well that's a given, anything is better than episode 2.
True, I just didn't like how it ended.
Well who ends a movie by killing everyone to set up a movie from 40 years ago?
I was so sad when that happened.
Though it was great to see the Princess again.
That made me cry even more. I can't believe she died.
The number of people that cried after hearing that; I'm pretty sure it raised the sea level more than global warming did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the first Star Wars movie you saw?
I saw it at home with my family.
I liked the battle at the end.
Those were pretty neat special effects for the time.
Did George Lucas direct that one?
I think he did.
I think it was called "A new hope."
I didn't like the 3 prequels.
He directed those too.
I know.  They were awful.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Chewbacca.
I think he is in several STAR WARS movies.
He is tall and furry.
He is like a big puppy.
But he growls like a bear.
And he is smart also.
He could play that chess like game.
And fly the space ship.
He was a Wookie.
I think the biggest Wookie ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rey will become a great fighter!
Of course, I think she will do lots of good for the galaxy
Will she ever be as good as Luke was?
That's tough to say, Luke was indeed a great fighter
I feel like both of them have overcome great obstacles
Like losing family members and whatnot?
Yeah, Luke almost killed his dad.
True, that made him very powerful but also made him love his dad too
I wonder if Rey will have any really tough decisions to make in the new movie
I think she'll become one of the best Jedi of all time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the original Star Wars movies or the new one?
I guess being older I like the original ones.
Who was your favorite character?
Boba Fett
Boba Fett? Really why Boba Fett? Although he is a prime character he never says anything?
I know, That is why I like him?
Seriously? Can you explain?
Sure. Darth Vader if narcissist and talks about himself, Luke talks about "Whoa is me, I'm the victim" and Leya talks about saving the world. Boba Fett is quiet, does his job, and causes no issues.
Well that might make sense on a basic level, but you do realize that there is more to the movie than that on a deeper level, right?
Yup but you didn't ask me that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's funny how I never believed Episode III was the last Star Wars film.
Too much money to be made.
Too much merchandise to sell.
George Lucas was  a genius to make as much off of that as he did.
It's his fault, though, that we get all these films trying to copy the Star Wars formula now..
Oh yeah, I mean now every movie has to be a blockbuster.
That's why Disney bought  Star Wars though. They wanted to make a ton of money.
I just feel like they should have left the original three movies alone.
I wish they left Han alive instead of wasting his death on Kylo.
I do too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate the whole thing in that scene in the bar
What thing
the thing everyone debates?
Explain
Everyone argues over who shot first
And?
Well does it even matter
I do not know
Well it does not impact the story either
I guess that is true
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes, it was awesome.
What was your favorite part?
I love the Yoda scene when he first appears.
Do you think he was testing Luke's patience with R2-D2 in that scene?
Of course. Every move was calculated.
Did you like the love story?
Yes, Han and the princess were great together.
Did you like the original actor that played the emperor?
Yeah, I think there was a woman that wore the costume and a man that did the voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best Star Wars movie.
I'd say either Empire Strikes back or Rogue One.
Yeah definitely both awesome.
I'm going to go with Empire.
As you should.  It was awesome and had the reveal about Vader being Luke's father.
Plus is is part of the main story.  Rogue One was great but more of an interest piece.
And in Empire they showed that the bad guys can win.
At least for a while.  Everything was bad for the Rebellion after Empire.
But they turned it around in the next movie.
Yeah, only because Luke finished his training.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
It is a great series
What do you think about Padme?
She seems like a weak character
How is that?
It seemed like she gave up after Anakin turned to the dark side. She had a lot longer to live.
It was good that she went ahead and gave birth
Yeah, both of her kids were very important people
I wonder if she thought Anakin might turn
It took her by surprise
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who I didn't expect to see in Revenge of the Sith?  Chewy.
Yeah I didn't know Wookies lived that long.
Yeah, I hear they live a very long time.
I felt so bad for Chewy when Han died.
I know, that was almost the saddest thing I've seen in a movie.
It almost sent me into tears.  Him and Han are the best bromance of all time.
Yeah they are.  You know a franchise is good when you have feelings for the characters.
Yeah, and it's not like we can understand Chewy.
Shows how good that acting is.
And the acting around him.  He's a great character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
It's a good story.
What do you like about it?
I like the space battles and the struggle against an evil empire.
It's sad that the Empire was so crazy.
They were evil.
It's not unlike some of the leaders in the world today.
It's wasn't a democracy, but they seemed to be doing well financially
I would have fought against them
They would have to go
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie do you like the most?
For me, it's Empire Strikes Back, because when I was a kid the wait to see what happened next was so long and exciting!
You don't find that Empire seems outdated compared to today's movie standards?
Well, you can't compare older movies' effects to today's CGI stuff, which is why George Lucas went back and tried to digitally edit new CGI in.
That didn't go too well, since it made the new graphics in all of those original trilogy movies stick out like a sore thumb.
Sure, but you'll note that Empire Strikes Back had the least amount of new scenes added for the Special Edition.
That probably means Empire Strikes Back was probably good enough to stand the test of time.
Exactly what I was saying, and that's one of the main reason why I think Empire Strikes Back is my favorite!
Well, I thought Jar Jar was funny in the Phantom Menace.
"I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain" - That's a line from Empire Strikes back and fitting to what you just told me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear there is a Star Wars 8 coming out soon?
Yes1 I heard it is called Star Wars 8 "The Last Jedi 8".
It has many new Characters, I heard.
Luke Skywalker will be in it.
I can not wait till it comes out.
Me too! they have shown a trailer of the movie.
Star Wars V is a good episode, it is when Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker fight.
That was great! Luke did not know Darth Vader was his dad.
Darth Vader was always trying to make Luke Skywalker join the dark side but he did not.
I know!, but in the end Darth Vader became a decent person and left the dark side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I guess if one person can do that, it's Lucas.
He invented the whole thing to begin with
Yep. And it got too complicated with so many people writing different stories off the original series
Heard they have binders they call bibles where they keep track of them all.
Yep. initially. But they have a databse now. Holocron database.
Named after the Holocron of Jedi's?
Yep. The ancient repositories of knowledge and wisdom.
That's so geeky.
Well, they are sci fi fans though and though.
I wonder if they dream about it. I'm sure they do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the newer star wars movies?
Yeah I like them a lot!
Why do you like them so much?
The graphics are fantastic and the actors are really cool
Do you like the special effects of the older movies?
Like Episode 1 or Episode 4?
Older like episode 4
Not so much, they are good for the time but now it seems a little cheesy
Yeah that's true, I like the older storylines though
True, the new movies are based on smaller plots
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the first Star Wars movie when it came out in the 1970s?
Yes, but I was seven in 1977.
Do you still remember it?
Believe it or not, yes I still remember seeing it.
Must have been a great movie for you.
It was, A New Hope was the best at the time.
Must of been if you remember seeing it so long ago when you were young.
Think that is true of only a couple other movies.
What did you like about it?
It is a coming of age story of Luke Skywalker.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was The Force Awakens any good?
It was okay.
What did you like?
I liked the intro and I liked some of the puppets.
What didn't you like?
I did not like the huge death star planet, or the digital creations
I see what you mean
It was advertised as having a lot of puppets and I cannot remember any notable ones
There were a couple. But, there was way more digital stuff
I hope they do better on the next movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's funny how they use working titles when making films.
Not sure what you mean.
For instance, instead of calling it Star Wars, they'll call it something different like Blue Harvest.
Guess what the working title of the second prequel was?
The Search for More Money?
It was actually Jar Jar's Big Adventure.
That's funny and creative all at once.
It was a tongue and cheek reference to that vilified character.
It may not have been worse than Attack of the Clones anyway.
Very true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
In the Star Wars movies, why does everyone accept the clones, from the second episode.
Well, it is complicated, but they do since they needed them.
But, why were they made.
A rogue Jedi thought that soldiers would be needed, so he commissioned them to be created.
Is that not sort of against the Jedi code?
Yes, but they still used them.
How did they all turn so bad and turn into the bad people in the white suits.
Those are not all clones, the Empire takes kids as well, and in Finn, and turns them into storm troopers.
So, the Jedi did what they did.
In a way yes, though the did not know they were commissioned, the clones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Revenge of the Sith.
Defintly the best of the prequels and a very good movie.
Yeah, I might even put it about Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, it had a great darkness to it you don't see a lot of.
Yes, and watching Anikan finally turn to the dark side was awesome.
And they had him full on Vader at the end.
Yes, the fight between him and Obi Wan was epic as well.
Not as epic as that fight between Yoda and the Emperor.
That was amazing.  They are both great dualist.
And have significant mastery of the Force.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about rogue one?
I thought it wasn't bad, better than force awakens.
I thought the same.
Who was your favorite character?
I liked the blind asian monk guy.
Oh yeah, his belief in the force was crazy.
I know right? He just blindly walked into laser fire.
Haha, but his buddy covered his back.
Yeah that's true. But what was their backstory?
It wasn't really mentioned.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the part when the ewoks were introduced in the Star Wars movies?
The first time I watched it, I was a little freaked out.
Me too!
The ewoks looks like teddy bears.
I know! It's amazing that there were so many.
Some of them were cute, but some of them scared me.
I am glad that the ewoks were able to help Han Solo, Princess Leia and the others.
Yeah, without them, it would of been hard getting inside the base.
My favorite part was when the ewoks went into the big robots.
That was so funny!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about Luke Skywalker, as an action hero?
Well, he's great.
I like him a lot, as someone we viewers can relate to.
Especially in the first movie, as this kind of bored kid who wonders what's out there in the world for him.
Kind of like a male Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, do you think?
I like that idea!
Another interesting thing about Luke is the idea that he is the one we are more like, while Han Solo is the one we want to be like.
Yeah, and can never be, because he's so impossibly cool!
But Luke changes and grows the most across all the movies, I think.
Yes, by the time we meet him in Return of the Jedi, you can tell he's gone through a pretty intense series of experiences!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is a parsec?
Huh?
In Star Wars, Han said he did the Kestle Run in 12 parsecs?
So?
I heard that a parsec is a measure of distance not time.
Oh. Maybe since he's going the speed of light it blurs the lines of distance and time.
Interesting, but I don't think he's going light speed.
I thought that's what they "jumped" to.
I'll have to look that up.
Do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the original Star Wars trilogy best or the newer films?
I think they're all good in their own right, but I tend to prefer the original trilogy.
But the new movies don't have the same great writing or inventiveness and the acting is miserable by comparison!
I wouldn't say that Mark Hamil was particularly talented, would you?
Not really, no.  But Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford gave classic performances!
That's true but part of that could just be nostalgia for a film series that was so innovative and new compared to other sci-fi movies from earlier eras.
That's true.  And the new movies do have excellent production quality and provide interesting background and cool story arc advancement.
I agree.  I like that the origins of Darth Vader were made clear along with the fall of the Jedi.  I also like seeing the resurgence of the Rebels.
But don't you think there were some things that just didn't fit in with the Anakin Skywalker storyline?  Like the Gungans, for example?
I do agree that it seems like George Lucas just wanted another Ewok-like culture to drive sales, as the Gungans really were not essential to the story.  But they provided an impetus for Amadala's actions in Episode 1, even if it was a weak one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why is Boba Fett so popular?
I actually have no idea.
He barely shows up in Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, and when he does, he gets killed.
And not heroically, he dies like a punk.
I think he gets bonked in the back of the head by accident like one of the three stooges and knocked into the Sarlacc pit.
What the hell is the Sarlacc pit in the first place?
It's like the vagina dentata of the desert.
Wow, that makes Fett's death even sader. But people still love him.
They also tried to hype him up with the prequels too, added a dad, made him Polynesian or something. It's just a mess, the whole backstory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see the new Star Wars movie?
Probably. Last year, I saw The Force Awakens, and it was pretty good.
Yeah, I liked that one too. A lot better than those three around the time with Jar Jar Binks.
I didn't like those either. That character was too annoying.
I think The Force Awakens felt more like the original three.
Yeah, me too. And J.J. Abrams directed it, so that's probably part of the reason it was good.
Yeah, he's great. I liked seeing Luke, Hans Solo and Princess Leia in the movie too.
Me too. That added a lot, for me.
I probably will keep seeing the new ones if they are as good as that one was.
I probably will, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rey will always be good?
I sure hope so! She has a lot of potential!
And that potential can be used for good or for evil!
Pretty much what happened to Anakin!
What happened to him again?
He was the chosen one, but chose the dark side
Why would he do that?
He wanted to avenge Padme's death
Who made him join the dark side?
Darth Sidious did, he offered him the power!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars hero?
Gonna have to say Solo.
Yeah Hon was pretty great.
How about you.
Skywalker of course.
Every one says Luke.
Not every one. The girls alway go for Leia.
True. Strong female charachter.
And not to hard on the eyes.
Sexist!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue One?
Yup.
Some of the best CGI I've ever seen!
Where?
Govenor Tarkin...?
Oh, yeah. How did they do that?
They used old footage and had a body double.
That was pretty well done.
All except for  Leia.
She did look a bit off...
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am serious i think Episode 1 is decent
But how can it be decent
Well it had several decent ideas of exectution
Good ideas does not make it good
Well i know
Then why are you defending it
it also gave us podracing
Which is a huge joke
Not at all
Yes easily
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars?
I like the old ones.
Who is your favorite character?
That's tough. Probably Han Solo.
Why Han solo?
Well, he was played by Harrison Ford, and he's one of my favorite actors.
Isn't that the same guy that starred in Indiana Jones?
Yea that's another one of the many movies he was in.
Yea I guess that guy is pretty cool.
He sure is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite parts of Star Wars is when Luke goes to Dagobah to train with Yoda.
That is a great little storyline!
I always thought Yoda was kind of a perfect teacher. He's patient but firm.
He does talk really weirdly though.
I sort of wondered if he was supposed to be, like, a mountaintop guru from a kung-fu movie.
I can see that. That's probably the trope they were going for.
Yeah, but even so, I think it turned out really well.
If only Luke had actually listened to him!
I know. But it ended up being good for the story!
I guess so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Disney owns Star Wars?
That's been a thing for years now, hasn't it?
Yeah. Some weren't too happy about it at first.
Did they think that the films would be marketed towards kids again?
Yeah, but thankfully that wasn't the case.
Agreed. The latest two were still great films, even under Disney's name.
It shouldn't come as a surprise, either.
What makes you say that?
Disney owns Marvel, and Marvel Studios has been killing it with their films.
This is very true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey, have  you watched star wars?
NO, why?
you mean you haven't watched star wars?
yes man, is it a big deal?
yes of course it is..
no it isn't
you should start with the force awakens
how good is it?
super good
okay, i'll try it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they should havr given Darth Maul more lines in The Phantom Menace.
Of course. He had a cool voice.
They killed him off way too early.
I agree. There was a lot of potential there.
Did you like his costume?
The black robe was perfect.
What about the horns?
The horns were a bit too much for me.
I wonder why they killed him.
I have no clue.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Disney is doing a pretty good job with Star Wars.
So much better than I expected.
Well, look at who is directing.
Who?
J.J. Abrams.
Oh yeah, but I heard he isn't directing 8.
That's sad.
I'm still excited though.
Me too.
At least it's not Lucas!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Han Solo?
Well I think he's a neat character I can explain further but I think Chewie is a vital part to his personality.
Yeah I can't imagine Han WIthout Chewie.
Since you brought it up do you think of Han?
I think he's a really neat character, he's in short a space cowboy in a highly advanced universe.
Never thought of him like a cowboy but I guess if you put a hat on him he would.
Answer me this, did Han shoot first?
Yes that was obvious.
No he didn't.
Yes he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which droid from Star Wars is your favorite?
I personally love K-2SO from Rogue One.
Even more than R2-D2 and C-3PO?
I know he's newer, and dead now, but K-2SO has the best personality.
What about B-B8?
He's cool too, and is probably my second favorite.
I'd say B-B8 is my favorite.
I'm excited to see him in the new movie in December.
Yeah, the trailer for that looks amazing!
I know, I can't wait to see Luke Skywalker training Rey.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was there a part of The Force Awakens that you didn't like?
Oh there were lots I didn't like!
Which part did you dislike the most?
I think it was when Han Solo tried to talk to Kylo Ren.
It was such a twist to find out he was their son!
I know, I was so shocked!
I totally hate what happened!
I know, I can't believe Kylo Ren tricked Han Solo.
I am just hoping Han Solo is still alive.
I wish that as well but I don't know if that will happen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Star Wars character?
Luke Skywalker!
Mine is Darth Vader.
You evil villain!
Don't worry. I also really like Chewbacca and R2D2.
Yeah they're all pretty cool.
Now that I think about it. I like all the Star Wars characters
I'll say. they're all pretty unique.
That's probably what makes Star Wars so popular.
No kidding.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, just curious which one of the Star Wars movies is your favorite?
Probably the Empire Strikes back.
Why? Jedi was a much better movie.
Jedi had such a bad warm fuzzy ending though, it was very cheesy.
Why does that make Jedi a bad movie though?
I don't know, there are tons of movies with obvious happy endings, it just seemed kind of lame to me.
Well what's so special about the Empire Strike back?
Luke gets his hand cut off, the Rebellion is in bad shape, it ended on a negative tone.
Why does that make it better?
Because its rare to see movies end on a negative, it was refreshing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not as much of a hater on the changes Lucas put into the remasters.
Whoa wait, you like the digital effects touch ups on the original trilogy?
I don't hate them, they're what he would have added if he could have at the time of filming.
I do not agree with that, it seemed to me like something he was doing just to put bullet points on the box.
See but you can never really know that.
What other logical reason is there to obsessively add stuff to films that are already perfect other than artificial value?
A man thinking he can do better, people give him a bad wrap for so many things I feel bad.
While I don't think he is being malicious when he adds stuff, at the same time it's okay to not like them.
I guess you're right, it's just kind of sad to watch people rag on the creator of Star Wars.
Oh agreed, I will never stoop to that level because he gave us such a gift.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about all of the changes that George Lucas made to the original Star Wars trilogy?
I don't mind the small special effects improvements but the major changes and ones that actually alter the story, I really dislike.
What change do you dislike the most?
Probably that music number from Return of the Jedi called Jedi Rocks. It changes the whole tone of the scene and it extremely annoying.
Most people would say that the Han shot first change is the worst.
That's pretty bad but it's so quick that you can ignore it. You can't ignore the Jedi Rocks song.
What change did you like the most of them all?
Like I said, the minor special effects changes are nice actually. They just make the movies look a little nicer and more modern without dramatically changing the movie.
What did you think about the CGI Jabba the Hutt that was added in the Star Wars Special addition?
I think it looks very fake and out of place. It's kind of a cool scene that maybe they could have added as a DVD extra but to have it as part of the movie forever is a bad thing I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Han and Leia being Kylo Ren's parents?
I thought it made sense once the details were reveled in the movie.
Yeah, that was a sad twist, how Luke was the one training him and Kylo--I mean Ben--went bad.
Yeah, that created a strong and believable reason why Luke ran off and lived alone all those years. His own nephew turned Sith on him.
And destroyed the Jedi Academy, don't forget that.
Yeah, talk about a tragic event. I hope they have some flashbacks in the new movie that explains more about what happened with that.
I would think so. At the end of the last one, "Force Awakens", Rey finds Luke, so i'm sure she will ask about what happened that made him run away like that.
Yeah, poor Leia. That was sad when Kylo Ren killed Han. Hope she finds some answers and confronts Kylo herself.
Yeah, that would be an awesome scene!
Guess we'll have to wait till December when "The Last Jedi" comes out and hopefully will find out more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
Of course I have, who has´t?
Which is your favorite?
I would have to say Star Wars: Episode IV -A New Hope
Really? I thought you liked the new ones better. Why is this?
I think the original 3 are better: Plus I really liked Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher young.
So about the new movies? What do you think of Rey, who is she related to?
I have my theories, some may assume is Han and Leia´s daughter. But I´m thinking more of Luke´s daughter or Obi-Wan Kenobi´s granddaughter.
Do you think she will turn to the Dark Force?
No, I think she will become the best Jedi that ever existed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this blows
What blows
I am trying to get into something and it is just not working
What is not working?
Well i am trying to get into star wars but it is bad
I think you might be doing it wrong
How can i do that
Are you starting from the first
Yes of course
That is why do not start their jar jar is really bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
BB-8 is the greatest star wars sidekick of all time!
What are you talking about? Even the Ewoks are better than BB-8.
Those fluffy little teddy bears? I don't think so.
What about Chewbacca?
Chewbacca is no ones sidekick. He is his own man.
That's debatable, but even given that, there is no way you can claim BB-8 is a better droid sidekick than R2D2.
Sorry, BB-8 just looks cooler.
Maybe, but R2D2 has much more personality.
R2D2 is nothing without C3P0.
How can you say that? You are so wrong!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the guy who voiced Darth Vader?
Oh man, I think you mean James Earl Jones.
Yes, that's who I was thinking of.  Did he come back for Rogue One?
I believe he did.  He'll always be the voice of Darth Vader.
You can't fake him.  He'll never be replicated.
It is possible they could just recreate his voice from computers.
If they had to, sure, but hopefully nothing ever happens to James Earl Jones.
Darth Vader might be done anyway.
Yeah, they will probably move on from the character anyway.
That's what I'm thinking as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the state-of-the-art CGI in the new Star Wars movies?
Oh, I love it. Its so gorgeous.
Which scenes are you thinking of?
It was interesting to me how they completely computer-generated Princess Leia.
Right. Some people found that eery though.
Yeah the timing wasn't great. Then Snoke was intriguing.
I agree there. You didn't think he was too much like a Lord of the Rings character?
Is that what they're saying.
Some people think that.
Thats not what I think at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Its old but i really like the empire strikes back
Thats a good one
Its definitely my favorite
When did it come out
1980
Wow before i was born
Me too
I wonder if they were popular when they came out
I always wondered that too
Probably
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I actually like Obi Wan Kenobi a lot.
The old version or the young one?
I like them both but I prefer the older Obi Wan.
Why do you like him the best?
I like how he is a teacher and is secretly watching Luke grow up. It's like he already knows all the events that will transpire.
Why do you think he let Darth Vadar kill him?
I think it has to do with a Force ability to come back as a ghost after you are dead. He even says that he will be more powerful than Darth Vadar ever imagined.
I never thought of it that way, it is an interesting theory. Do you think the Sith can do it also?
Possibly but its probably a more warped version of the ability. I think it is related to Anakin thinking he can prevent death from happening or some kind of mastery over death like that.

What was your favorite scene in Episode Seven?
There's so many great scenes that I can't pick a favorite but a few stand out, what's yours?
I liked the battle on Takodana. It was epic with lots of actions and everything about it was great.
I like the part on Jakku when Rey and Fin were being chased by the First Order, especially when the Milenium Falcon was revealed.
Oh wow, that was really cool. I saw The Force Awakens in the theater and everyone cheered when the Milenium Falcom showed up.
That was a great aerial chase scene with the Millennium Falcon and the First Order Tie Fighters.
What I really appreciated is how much detail they put into the Milenium Falcon interior to be sure it matched with the interiors from the original movies.
If you didn't know any better you might think that they were using the exact same set for it as they did in the original trilogy.
You could really tell that JJ Abrams put a lot of thought into little details like that.
He was a Star Wars fan himself so I'm sure he was passionate about making all the little things just right in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Han Solo stand alone movie will explain about how he got the Falcon?
I hope so, and how he met Chewy.  Best team in movie history.
I hope Lando has some good parts in it too.  One of the most underrated Characters in Star Wars history.
He definitely needs plenty of screen time.
I hope Harrison Ford makes some type of appearance in it.
Like in the beginning, talking to a young Ben Solo before he becomes Kilo Ren.
Exactly like that.  I understand Harrison is older than dirt and cannot play young Han but you have to tip your hat to the original.
It should be good, I also hope they find a way to get Vader and some other Star Wars characters in there.
I'm sure they will.  They always do find a way, and I hope they use a good plot device to get them in there.
Great way to start the movie, Leah says to Han, "tell Ben how you met Chewy" Han says "I've got a bad feeling about this"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite charater in Star Wars?
Princess Leia of course.
I love her too.
She's amazing, but now that Carrie Fisher is dead, I'm sad her character is gone.
So true, though she finished filming the next film before her death.
I'm so thankful for that.
Plus, I guess editors could use previously recorded footage of her like they did in Rogue One.
Yeah, they could, but it would be so weird.
I agree. I mean, she is dead.
Exactly. Hopefully, they'll find a great way to edit the story so her death makes sense, even if that's not what I want.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character from the original trilogy?
My favorite character is Han Solo, how about you?
I really thought Boba Fett was a cool character!
Yeah, I wish he had more screen time in the movies.
I'm still mad how they treated his character in the prequel trilogy!
Yeah, they turned such a cool character into a wimpy kid.
The prequel trilogy ruined a lot of stuff though.
Yeah, I really hate them, especially Attack of the Clones!
Why do you hate it the most?
I hate it the most because of the horrible love story between Anakin and Padme!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The spaceships always seemed a little funny to me in Star Wars.
How so?
Well, like, x-wings are super cool, they're designed to look like futuristic planes.
Right. And Luke flies one, so we have to like it.
But aren't TIE fighters kind of weird looking?
They do seem like they'd be stiff or something.
Exactly. And Vader flies one and they seem so fragile. They seem outmatched.
Well, the rebels were supposed to win.
Right, but they're also supposed to be underdogs!
I see your point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favourite Star Wars character?
Probably c3po. His sense of humor, and manner of speech are just so entertaining.
I went as him for halloween one year!
Oh man, I wish I could've seen that! Yeah as an asexual I find him really relateable.
But I thought you referred to some of the cast members as attractive.
Yeah aesthetically. Harrison Ford for example, he's another reason I liked watching them so much.
Ah I get it. Yeah I felt that way about Darth Vader, I had such a crush on him growing up.
I'm surprised you didn't go as him for Halloween.
Well, when cosplaying as Vader it would really be more about the clothes, mask and everything. I thought the character c3po lends itself well more to body paints and makeup type stuff.
That makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Star Wars movie?
I haven't yet is it still in theaters?
No, not anymore but you can get it on Xfinity.
Ok great. I heard there are new characters!
Yes! My favorite is the female lead Rey.
I can't wait to see it I wonder if it will be better than the Old Republic.
I thought so!
I'm going to need to refresh myself and watch them all before the Force Awakens.
Yes I want to figure out if Rey is related to Luke Skywalker.
We will have to wait and find out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Rogue One?
I liked it. What did you think?
I liked it too, but it wasn't my favorite.
Why not?
None of the characters seemed really fleshed out.
Yeah, I thought that way too.
I thought it was fine, but I didn't understand the huge hype.
Neither did I, to be honest.
Still, it was good.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Kylo Ren is the son of Leia and Han Solo?
Yes, I've seen the force awakens
What other star wars movies have you seen?
Just the first one
What is that one called?
A New Hope
Right, and the Empire STrikes Back is after that
Correct. And then Return of the Jedi
I was terrified of jabba the hut as a kid
We all were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the path of Darth Vader would be different if he had known that his children had survived?
I think that wasn't the possibility, as it was intentionally kept from him.
But doesn't the fact that it was kept from him suggest that it could have influenced him?
I don't think that it would have brought him back into the Light side again. He was already too far gone.
But it seemed that his attitude changed after he met Luke and realized that he was his son.
I don't think so. He was still trying to corrupt Luke and bring him into the Dark Side.
So you believe that his affection towards Luke didn't really affect the level of his corruption?
The only thing that got Darth Vader to react was when the Emperor attacked Luke.
But that suggests that his priorities might have changed.
True. He was still dark, but the act of giving up his life for his son redeemed him in a way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you dislike anything about the Star Wars films?
I didn't like Duku as a character
What did you dislike about him?
I didn't understand why he turned to the dark side
His story left plenty of open ends
I didn't really understand the point of the droid army
It was supposed to have been a war fabricated by Sidious
The motives for the Trade Federation was a little unclear
They might just have been a large security force
That would be something a new army would go against
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched The Revenge of the Sith.
Definitely the best of the prequels.
Seeing Darth Vader emerge for the first time was definitely a great moment.
I can't understand why Yoda gave up on the Emperor though.  It looked like me might have been stronger.
It had nothing to do with strength.  It was because Palpatine had the high ground and Yoda couldn't defeat him.
I can see that.  Basically the opposite of Anikan and Obi Wan.
Yes, now you got it.  Even though Ani is stronger Obi Wan had the better position.
You know what else I liked?  How they really played the fall of Vader to be more tragic than betrayal.
That's the genius of Star Wars.
For sure, great plot writing to go along with the effects.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Larry, that hat you are wearing looks familiar.
It should. It's yours.
That's where I saw it before. On my head.
Yeah, but it looks better on me though. On me, it looks like a Storm Trouper's helmet
I can see that.
When I wear this hat, I look like an intergalactic space soldier getting ready to do some serioua damage on the rebel forces..
Welll, what do I look like?
You?
Yeah!
You look like a damaged mushroom.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what's weird in Star Wars? People that support the Empire.
What's weird about rooting for the Empire?
I guess nothing, as long as you know they're pure evil. But some people try to justify it.
It's not that different from rooting for the Rebels. They both have legitimate reasons for doing what they do.
But that's the thing, they don't. The Empire is literally just Space Nazis.
At least you can say they're the legitimate government. Some Rebels are basically just terrorists, too.
Yes, there are some morally gray Rebels, but it's not like rooting for the Separatists over the Republic. The Empire is just evil through and through.
But the Separatists aren't evil?
Both sides are controlled by the same Sith Lord. They both have real reasons to fight, though it doesn't matter since they're both pawns.
I see what you're saying. In that case it doesn't matter who you root for since the end result is the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The first new star wars movie was better than the second
I mean i cannot fully agree
it felt more original
Well it was the start of a new trilogy
Well obviously it was that why it is better
It just means they had to be more original
The movie rogue one just feels to fan servicey to me
Is that a bad thing though
I guess not in its entirety
Well gotta look at them for what they are
XXXXXXXXXXX
What color is C-3P0?
Gold
That confuses me. He was silver in the one I watched.
You watched Episode 2
Oh really?
Yes. He is silver in that one.
What color is he in the first one?
Many. He is only wires and they are many different colors.
Cool.
Yeah. He changes a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies
Love them
My favorite is star wars
Mine too
They are great movies
I real
Liked the return of the jedi
Thats one of the best
I love hans solo in it
He is great
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think Han shot first?
Well, what cut are we talking about?  Original or Lucas edited?
Doesnt matter, what do you think happened?
Well, Han only defended himself, so he shot second.
What makes you believe that?
When in any of the movies was he the original aggressor?
Never... I suppose you are right
Exactly!
I suppose Lucas should have never switched the scenes...
I could not agree with you more!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which lightsaber is your favorite?
The green one.
No, silly. Like, which specialty lightsaber?
Can you give options so I know what you're talking about?
Sure: double-sided blade from Maul, curved from Dooku, etc.
I like the Purple Saber of Darth Sidious.
That's not who has it.
What??
Are you even a Star Wars fan? The purple blade is Mace Windu.
Yeah, I don't really pay attention, sorry. they're fun to watch, though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Darth Maul
Really?... Why would you like that guy?
What's wrong with him?
He did like... nothing in the series
But he has a cool double lightsaber!
True
And his face is all badass!
Okay I see your point!
Cool, cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite sith?
darth maul.
i like vader the most.
that is so typical of you.
darth maul is super popular too, man.
darth maul is cool. he does all those flips.
he's like an acrobat and he spoke no words.
that made him more mysterious
everyone likes mystery to be honest.
thats true
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, apparently, Ewan McGregor wants to do an Obi-Wan Kenobi spin-off Star Wars film.
Then should let him. I don't think people would complain.
It makes more sense than the Young Han Solo film starring none of the original actors.
Which is still better than making a fake, CGI, young Han Solo, honestly.
Yeah, yeah, but my point is that McGregor is at the perfect age to play Obi-Wan during the era between Episodes III and IV.
So you want a midquel basically?
If it would work. Though if they wait too long to make it, he'll get old and they'll have to recast Obi-Wan yet again.
Or CGI young and just have him do the voice.
They'd just get James Arnold Taylor to voice him in that. He's  technically played Obi-Wan more than anyone because of that.
Huh. Never would've guessed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch star wars?
Yes I do
Did you like them
Love them
Me too
Who is your favorite character
Yoda
He's really good
Who is yours
Hans
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think they will handle Carrie Fisher's death in the upcoming movies?
I heard that she finished filming her part in the next film, so Leia's death won't be in that one, I think.
Or maybe they will add in her death into this film.
I feel like the audience won't want Leia to die in the films, it feels like too much.
Maybe she will go to another galaxy, or transform into something else?
I can imagine them making her transform into this spirit-type thing, and she will live forever.
Yeah, I think that would be a great homage to her, and they could bring back Han-Solo.
Whoa, yeah, that would definitely soften the blow, I think we definitely need to see him to be alright with her death.
Or maybe her part in the second film was final enough that there doesn't need to be anything enough.
I just hope whatever happens, it doesn't ruin how amazing she made the role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like Rogue One, you have seen it right?
Yes, I have and a I enjoyed it quite a bit.
What was you favorite character.
Jynn Erso, because she's kind of a croos bewteen Han Solo and Leia.
What do you mean, how is she a cross between those two?
Well, like like Leia she is a strong, confident woman, but like Han, she starts out fairly mercernary, but becomes a beleiver in the cause.
Okay, I see your point. Any of the new elements added for the film that you particularly liked.
The Death trooper, those black armored elite Stormtroopers.
Really, how come?
Because they put the threat and menace back into the Stormtrooper. I mean, after being defeated by Ewoks, did regular Stormtrooper intimidate you anymore?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best 'Star Wars' movie?
Well, 'Empire Strikes Back' is definitely the best.
What did you like about it?
So much happened in the movie.  And it actually had real stakes.
What stakes in particular?
Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father, Luke loses his hands, Han is frozen, and we're all left with a major cliffhanger.
Now that you mention it, that was so unique of Star Wars.  And viewers at the time must have left the theater with so many questions.
I don't think I could have waited years to see the next one.
It's especially impressive when you think about it because the second movie is always the toughest to make.
I agree.  Yet, somehow 'Empire' was an excellent standalone movie that also tied the 1st and 3rd movies together seamlessly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you see Episode 1?
When I was twelve.
What did you think of it?
I loved it. Darth Maul was awesome and I thought all the actors were amazing.
Did it make sense to you?
Not really. I had no idea what the bad guys wanted.
Did you think Darth Maul was cool?
Yes, I loved his paint.
What was the most creative part of the movie?
I liked the Pod racing scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, I watched that a couple weeks ago.
My family didn't like it, but I thought it was one of the best Star Wars films ever.
I agree. I think it was better suited for people who have a deep understanding of Star Wars.
I liked that it was toned down. Everyone wasn't all powerful
That's true. There were a lot of normal characters with no force powers that still played a big part.
It showcased what kind of sacrifice even one small task could take.
I personally liked how well it flowed into the storyline of the other movies.
Yeah, the ending sections of the movie had me in awe because of that.
Me too. It made me want to go back and watch the classic movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think rogue one was sort of cookie cutter
How was it cookie cutter
It kinda felt filler
Filler?
Like it is not important
But in the grand scheme of things it is
But how is that possible
Well they were the whole reason the death star was brought down
I still believe without those events things would have went well
Nah not at all
XXXXXXXXXXX
What about the prequels, which one was your favorite?
I guess the 3rd one; I forgot what it's called.
Why that one?
Because it was dark and had some tense moments.
What was wrong with the other 2 prequels.
Come on seriously. What about the slap stick comedy with Jar Jar and what not.
Yeah but I think it was because they were targeting kids to become fans.
Yeah but still, kids can appreciate a Star Wars movie without all of the silliness.
I guess that's true; I think that's what appealed about the original trilogy.
Yep absolutely!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think will happen in episode 8 and 9?
I think the Jedi will come be different
I hope they stop fighting
The starkiller base was pretty epic
Do you think they'll rebuild one of those?
I think they'll build something
They need to get their government under control
It would be nice to see them working together in the end
Too bad it's called Star Wars
I think Rey will do some training in the next one
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Boba Fett died too easily in 'Return of the Jedi?'
Yes, definitely.  He is supposed to be the most dangerous Bounty Hunter in the galaxy.
Exactly.  Yet, his death was almost comical.
Yes, it was very much a gag.  They built up Boba's reputation way too much for it to end that way.
Also, if you think about it, he really didn't get that much total screen time.
Come to think of it, you're right.  In fact, Jango from the prequel series got way more screen time.
I wish we could have seen more of Boba.
I think it says a lot about the iconic nature of the character, by the fact that despite his few appearances, he's so recognizable.
I agree.  They probably could have done so much more with the character.
Perhaps we'll get a standalone Boba Fett movie one day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so confused.  Who was Han Solo's dad?
Huh?  What are you talking about.
Who was his dad?  They never say in any movies.
Why does that matter?  I don't get what you're trying to get at.
It would be great to know his backstory.  They focused on everyone else's.
There's a movie coming out next year talking about his origin.
Oh really?  Okay, that's good to know.
I think it's even called Han Solo just so you know it's about him.
Oh sweet.  When is that coming out?
May I believe.  Should be pretty cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best quotable scene from the Star Wars movies?
I think it has to be, "These aren't the droids you're looking for?"
Really?  More so than, "No, I am your Father?"
Okay, perhaps you have a point.  That is the quintessential Star Wars line.
What about, "Now THIS, is podracing!?"
Now I know you're kidding.
You're right, I was joking around.
I think the most overused one may be "Do or do not.  There is not try."
Definitely overused.  I heard it in a graduation speech once.
You were correct about "No, I am your father" being the clear winner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man you like the new movie that came out
Which one
The one that is  the start of the new trilogy
It was pretty decent to be frank
Not wow omg amazing to you?
Nah the new characters did not do to much for me
I mean they could have been a bit more oomph to them
Yeah they kinda needed some more development
I feel they were as  one would say half baked
Exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you love Daisy Ridley
Yes, she's great in the new star wars movies.
I also love that harrison ford and carrie fisher were in the movies
I know that was wonderful
They really made up for how bad the prequels were
I think so for sure
George Lucas really messed those up
I did like Natalie Portman though
I hated her
Samuel Jackson is pretty great in those films too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about The Force Awakens. Where does it fit?
You mean with respect to the other 6 films?
Yes, that's right. Where does it rank?
Let's take this piecemeal. First, it has to be better than the prequels.
Has to be better? All of the prequels?
The first two prequels were a total disaster. The third was solid, but still far more full of cheese and CGI than The Force Awakens.
Fair enough. So where does it rank with respect to everything else?
That's harder. First, it simply can't be as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back.
Those are sacrosanct? Is it better than Return of the Jedi?
Ultimately, it isn't. It's solid, but Return of the Jedi has such important scenes that it can't rise above.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So any theories about the Last Jedi?
Well, I think we'll learn more about Snoke and what he is trying to do.
What do you mean?
Well, Snoke doesn't seem to be following the Sith traditions, but trying to create a new Dark Side tradition.
So, he looked back and saw flaws in the Sith.
Yeah, it be hard not to, the Sith went from a dominate galactic power to an obscure cult with only two members at a time.
So Snoke is avoiding the classic defintion of insanity, off doing the smae thing over and over and expecting a different result.
Yeah, he seems to be trying to create a Dark Side tradition as strong as the SIth, but with more self-discipline.
So basically, same evil power, but less moustache twirling and ego mania?
Basically, yes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about star wars
That sounds amazing
You like star wars?
Yes i kove star wars
Me too
Inlove hans solo
He is pretty cool
Who do you like
Yoda
Of course
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Darth Vadar?
I thought he was a very interesting character. I liked seeing the progression he made.
Ya it was interesting seeing the first three movies and seeing him a boy knowing he would become Darth Vadar.
I liked how at the end he came back to the light.
Ya I really liked that also. I wonder if Luke struggled with Darth Vadar being his father.
I think he probably did. I'm curious to see what happens with Luke in the new film.
I agree do you think he is related to Rey.
I don't know. I could see her being related to Obi Wan.
That's a good guess they do both sound the same and there is a lot about Obi Wan we don't know.
I felt the same way about Obi Wan. I want to learn more about him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This is going to sound weird but I kind of felt bad for Darth Vader.
I don't get how he was bullied around so much when he had so much power.
That always bothered me too.  Seemed like he could have destroyed anyone that crossed him.
I guess I felt bad for Vader until we met the Aniken version of him.
Aniken was super annoying, and he had so much crazy rage in him.
I think it was Hayden Christianson playing him though, I didn't like his acting.
I also thought he was a little bit stiff, but I think that is how he was supposed to be.
Ewan McGregor wasn't stiff though and he was a jedi.
I loved him in those movies!  He was my favorite.
Liam was pretty good as Qui-Gon Gin too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Force Awakens?
Yeah it was good.  Not as good as the original films but still good.
I thought so too.  Except I'm not a Kilo Ren fan.
People seem to love or hate him.
I just think throwing tantrums is beyond a bad guy in Star Wars.
Yeah, I didn't care much for that.  But he did some impressive things.
Like stop that blast in mid air and still pull information from that guys mind.
I know, he has some serious power.
I would like to see better fight scenes in the next one.
Me too, I hope we see a lot more Luke.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, who was the better character, Han Solo or Lando Clarissian
Oh, tough call, a very tough call indeed. I'd have to say they're dead even.
Okay, how do you figure that?
Well, Han had rugged good looks and a roguish charm about him, but Lando was suave and refined, and a definite ladies man.
Okay, Lando did feel little a Old West type gambler, while Han was more a cross between a cowboy and a pirate.
Yes, one was a charming bad boy with fast ship, while the other was a genteel scoundrel with a gambler's flair.
Plus, they both could fight and fly with the best.
Yes, remember Lando had some military experience and was the original owner of the Falcon.
And Han Solo, according to some of his backstory, was once a cadet in the Imperial Fleet Academy.
Yeah, if they haven't retconned that out already.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what are you up to man
I am up to nothing much
What you planning to watch tonight?
Gonna watch some star wars movies
Which ones you planning on watching
I am not to sure about it yet
Well i would advise to watch the new ones myself
Yeah i just might i have not watched them to many times myself
You should i can stop by and we can together
Sure thing lets do that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that sand creature in the original STAR WARS?
Yes, they were really scary.
Their heads were all wrapped up.
And their eyes where through those round metal things.
They made strange noises.
It was scary when they attacked Luke.
And the tore off C3-PO's arm!
Fortunately Ben Kenoby showed up to help Luke.
Like it was meant to be.
And they the arm back on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's amazing how much influence Star Wars has on pop culture these days.
Now that you mention it, I saw something Star Wars related in a video game recently.
Let's hear it!
Well, the video game was a Chinese knockoff of a game called Overwatch.
Okay? Where is this going?
One of the playable characters in the game was legitimately a Stormtrooper with a different name!
Really? That sounds ridiculous.
It is. I wound up playing Battlefront for hours after seeing that just to get it out of my mind.
I don't like video games at all. I'd rather be watching the movies.
i D
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Greedo the creepiest looking Star Wars villain of all time?
I'd say so, Rodian bounty hunters are spooky.
You know Greedo shot first right?
Of course I know that. Everybody knows that.
Everyone doesn't know that but most people are well aware.
You'd think the Mos Eisley Cantina would have a bouncer wouldn't you?
He wouldn't last a day with all that villainy and treachery.
Yeah, it's definitely a rough crowd in there.
Do you think they have a ladies night?
Sure they do. But I doubt it's the type of nice Tatooine ladies that you'd want to meet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the new Han Solo movie will be good?
I sure hope so! Han is my favorite Star Wars character.
It will definitely be weird to see Han as someone other than Harrison Ford
I know. The two are practically the same in my mind.
Alden Ehrenreich seems to be good though.
I watched some of his movies after he was announced as the actor. He definitely has talent.
I'm worried about the chaos with the director job lately.
I heard they just found someone to head the project. Ron Howard.
Oh, he's good! I loved Apollo 13.
With any luck, he'll have things back on track soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, have you heard about any news regarding the upcoming Star Wars movie?
I watched a recent TV teaser trailer on YouTube. It looks amazing.
I watched the teaser trailer too. It is great to see that Luke Skywalker is coming back as a main character.
Yeah, he is one of my favourite characters in the Star Wars franchise. But my favourite is always Darth Vader.
It is sad that Darth Vader will not return.
It is a pity indeed. But we can see him in other Star Wars movies, like the recent Rogue One movie.
You are right. I was so excited to see him in Rogue One. I almost cried in the theater.
Me too. It has been so long to see Darth Vader on the big screen.
Do you know whether there are any other Star Wars movies featuring him?
I have not heard any yet, but I am sure the movie studio will not forget him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Star Wars movie?
Empire was the best hands down!
I have to say I agree but a New Hope was great as well.
It was and so was Return of the Jedi. But Empire was just so amazing.
For me it's hard to pinpoint my favorite one.
It can be hard because they are all so good.
Are you excited about the new one coming out?
Oh you mean the Last Jedi? Oh my God yes.
I'm excited to see more about Luke Skywalker.
Me too and how he and Rey get along.
XXXXXXXXXXX
its so weird that kylo was taught by luke
yeah, and he was the son of han solo
but he wants to be like his grandfather
who>
darth vader
oh yeah, his mom is leia
that is really strange
even vader would have told him to stay with the jedis too though
he is stupid and seems like he's in a rebellious phase
but its weird both the sith and jedi are in him
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Gotta go with Chewie!
(Does wookie sound)
Haha! Yea, that's my boy!
(Does wookie sound)
Yup, that's the sound that he makes!
(Does wookie sound)
Okay... we got it
(Does wookie sound)
.....
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am not sure if i still like the old movies as much as the old ones?
Why not
The old ones seem kind of dated
You are crazy
No i am dead serious
Well then you sir are insane
Well if you think so
How could you like the travesty better
Which one is the  travesty
How dare you now know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars film trilogy do you like best?
That's a hard one. The trilogy with Anakin Skywalker's backstory had such great computer animation.
Agreed.  So you like them both equally?
No really I prefer the first trilogy that started in the 70's.
Unh hunh, what do you like about it?
The basic story.  Lucas created a mythic tale, no fuss.
Yea I heard he drew from different archetypes.
Right, so the basic stories to me, were front and center.
They weren't hard to understand or follow.
It was just his dialogue they say needed polishing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars movies?
Well I can't say that I am not a fan but also know some people who are obsessed and I am not at that level but a fan for the most part.
Have you seen all of the films?
Yes I have I think I saw them in theaters when the where released. Have you seen them all?
I have as well, but have never seen them all in one sitting, it's sort of something I want to do.
That is like 24 hours of movie watching, That is a big commitment, Would you watch them in the way they where release or a different way?
I think I would want to watch them in the order George Lucas intended them.
Did you know the first star wars was the first film to use THX surround sound
No but isn't THX owned by Jerge Lucas.
It think it is but didn't they sell to Dolby or something like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of kylo ren?
I think he seems like a very dark character as he should be.
Ya, I can't believe he killed Han considering the relationship there.
Interesting how star wars films deal with the father /son relationship.
Ya, it makes you wonder a little about george lucas's relationship with his father.
Probably troubled. I think star wars is so universal, most themes relate to life so deeply.
That is true and for sure part of the movie franchise's appeal to the masses.
Do you think rae and kylo are related?
I am thinking yes probably brother and sister. Like maybe she was hidden away like lea was seperated from luke.
Ya something around those lines would make sense for the movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the latest Star Wars movie?
No, I haven't yet. I'm looking forward to seeing it.
Which story arc do you like best?
My favorite arc was learning how Annakin become Darth Vader. Who would have imagined that little boy would have turned into the imposing Vader?
I'm more a fan of the original three movies released.
They sure packed a punch! I bet my ex wasn't the only one who thought he was piloting a fighter home after the movie!
I think part of that is that it was the first time we were exposed to that world. It was so much to take in.
True, even excellent sequels can suffer a bit in comparison, because the "newness" of the experience is gone. It seems like reviewers sometimes forget that.
The filmmakers must be always trying to up their game, to try to bring in new locations, characters and story reveals to make it new again.
It's a daunting task. I'm not sure they could ever top the impact of: "Luke, I am your father!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hate the Phantom Menace?
Yes it was a wasted opportunity and sellout of original fans.
Exactly. Too much for kiddies with Jar Jar and idiotic dialogue.
George Lucas was just making more money like with the reissues.
It was odd Jar Jar seemed like a racist caricature too.
Also Watto was.
Could have been a great movie. Darth Maul was a great character.
Yea Lucas is washed up as a director.
Yup and these new ones Rogue and Awakens are great with his hands off.
Lucas is done creatively but his works can be mined for more material.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you remember Jabba the Hutt's palace?
The one from Return of the Jedi?
Yeah, where they were using Han Solo as a decoration.
Yes, I remember it.  What about it?
Why do you think Jabba built it there?  The planet is a desert, and he is basically a giant slug.
You think he would have liked a wet planet better?
Wouldn't that make more sense?
I don't know, he was a gangster, and the Empire seemed to ignore Tattoine.
You think he was basically using it as a low key hideout?
Maybe.  Might make for a nice spinoff movie.  How did Jabba end up there in the first place?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just rewatched Return of the Jedi.
I haven't watched that movie in a while. I bet I can still quote the Emperor though!
Do you mean when he talks to Darth Vader or when he's talking to Luke near the end?
Both, but especially at the end when he's about to use Force Lightning on Luke.
Those movies had great villains. Do you think the new movie villains are as good?
I think Kylo Ren is pretty awesome, but I'm not sure I want to call him a villain just yet.
You think he's going to be redeemed in the next movie?
I don't know if The Last Jedi will redeem him, but I hope so.
I don't think a lot of people want him to be redeemed after Han died in The Force Awakens.
I think they still do. If not, Kylo will make an awesome villain to remember.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did they decide to change the fighting style in the prequels?
You mean from Samurai style to Chinese style?
Is that what that's supposed to be?
yes. Chinese style has more movements making it look flashy.
Yeah, guess that makes the light saber moves more dramatic.
Way more dramatic, but also a lot more woirk, but that's made possible with better computers.
Yep.
You know whatI think it owuld've been cool?
What?
You know how Anakin goes and kills all the jedi kids? I think his blade should've turned red or at least purple. And totally red by the time he battles Kenobi
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to watch a movie tonight?
Yes! Can we watch the Force Awakens?
What's it about?
It's the newest Star Wars movie silly!
Oh, I've been meaning to see that.
It's so good! You'll love it.
Have you already seen it?
Yes, but I would like to see it again.
Okay, I will pick it up from red box on my way home.
Sounds great! I'm stoked.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the original star wars or newer star wars movies better?
I like the original star wars better, my favorite is Empire Strikes Back!
I agree, while I have enjoyed some of the new ones, I like the original three star wars movies the most.
Who is your favorite character in all of the star wars movies?
Mine is C3PO, I think he is hilarious, how about you?
I have always liked Han Solo the best.  I guess I like his rogue nature.
I guess I like the lesser characters addition to the movies.
I agree, the interactions between Chewy and Han are classic, and C3PO is sort of funny.
Did you predict Han and Leia having a child?
I did not see that one coming at all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that RETURN OF THE JEDI movie?
I think that is the movie that starts on that ice planet.
I think so also. I think they went to a jungle planet also.
I think the Wookies lived there.
The Wookies helped a lot.
Darth Vader had some kind of base there in the forest.
And they had a big chase scene there also.
And they made that big 2 leg walking thing fall over.
And used their blasters i thing to get in.
That was a great sequel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about what happened with the young Han Solo movie?
No, what happened?
They fired the directors.
Why did they do this?
Creative differences is the official reason.
Didn't they already start filming?
They sure did, I not sure how much they've done.
Hopefully it still will be a good movie.
Woody seems to think it will be good.
That's promising. Fingers crossed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did the original Star Wars come out in 1975?
No, it came out in 1977
Wow. That is a long time ago.
Yes it was. I think that tons of people saw it.
Was there a big craze when it came out?
Yes. People went crazy over it.
Are there any other films?
Yes. There are tons of Star Wars films.
Which one is the all time greatest?
The original, but tons of people would say Empire Strikes Back is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Know anything about the new Han Solo movie?
No.
The directors, just got fired and replaced by Ron Howard.
Ron Howard? It's been years since he had a hit.
Yeah, but I think he'll be good.
What makes you say that?
The guy has won an academy award for directing. You dont forget how to direct because of a few flops.
We'll see.
Give the man a chance. He hasn't even started yet and you're skeptical.
I'm not skeptical,, I just dont like wasting my money. I'll probably see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello
Well hello there
How are you doing
i am doing good that is well bro
Yeah i am just watching rogue one
What sort of movie is that
Its a midquel for star wars
What does that even mean
It takes place between two of the episodes
Ah so it is not a prequel but not a sequel gotcha
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where are the Wookies from?
Kashyyk.
That right!
I loved that battle sceene in the prequels.
It was pretty epic.
So much so they put it in the video game.
Which one?
Battle Front II.
That was an awesome game!
Better than the new one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what was a good movie?  The Empire Strikes Back.
Yes, probably the best of the Star Wars movies.
I wouldn't argue that a bit.  Vader was just amazing in the second film.
Yeah, that force choke was taking people out left and right.
Of course Han and Leia were a good side story too.
Yeah, like when she said that she loves him right before being sent into the carbonite.
Of course his classic response, "I know."
One of the best parts of the franchise.
Of course I'd be remiss if we didn't say that best line of the Franchise, and maybe of movie history.
No!  I am your father.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The best Star Wars movie was the first one.
Oh, yes, Harrison Ford was so young and handsome.
Who played Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars movie?
I can't remember, but he had an awful haircut in that movie.
My least favorite characterization was Jabba the Hutt--was it the second Star Wars>
I think so. I agree, how stupid for a big slug to laschiviously look at Carrie Fisher.
I did enjoy Darth Vader.
Oh, my, that deep, sexy voice of James Earl Ray.
It was kind of stupid for Luke and Leia's mom to die of heartbreak.
Seriously, I mean, she "lost" Anakin, but she had 2 beautiful babies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?
Yes, I've seen all of them. Except for Revenge of the Sith.
Seriously? You have to see that one.
Which one is your favorite?
Believe it or not, I actually love the older ones. I think Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.
Is that the one where Luke finds out Darth Vader is his father?
Yes. Do you think they're going to make more movies?
Definitely. I heard there's going to be a new on in 2019.
That is awesome.
I know. I can't wait.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Hut's I think they're called in Star Wars?
The big dudes that are always leading the cartel's and what not?
Exactly right.
Well I think they're lazy for starters and i'm not sure why they're even in that position to begin with maybe it's just the money they have.
Well they're big so that's intimidating.
Yes but they can barely move at all.
That's a solid point.
Yeah so I don't get it but I do like them as a whole in the movies.
Some good scenes came out of them for sure.
Yep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see the re-releases of the Star Wars movies?
You mean the ones they put out in the theatres?
Yeah.
I saw the first one, but it didn't really seem worth my time.
I was kind of strange.
The stuff they added was just weird.
I agree. Guess they were just trying to make an extra buck.
Leave it to the studios to make something worse.
How about George Lucas?
True. Probably as much his fault.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think it felt being Han Solo frozen in carbonite?
Oh man, I don't even like to think about it.
What if he was awake the whole time, but just couldn't move or open his eyes?
That's a creepy thing to even think about.
I know, but he was in there for a long time.
How did they keep him alive without being able to eat?
It's a drama in space and you're worried about how someone stuck in a rock ate?
I mean, it's a valid question.
I suppose you're right.
What if they just fed him a really big meal to tide him over until he got out?
XXXXXXXXXXX
The serial escalation in Star Wars is kind of dumb, honestly.
What are you referring to?
So, for example, you've got the Death Star, right?
Yeah, what about it?
Well, it's huge and it blows up planets. Then comes the Death Star II.
Yeah, that one was even bigger.
Right, and they followed it up with Starkiller Base. A planet that eats stars and blows up many planets.
It does sound a little silly when you put it like that. Maybe in the next one have a solar system sized weapon powered by a black hole.
You joke, but the odds that of that happening are higher than you think.
Never tell me the odds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking about he STAR WARS Death Star.
That thing must have been big.
Remember when Luke and them first saw it.
Yes. They thought it was a planet.
Then I think someone said, "That's no planet."
That tractor beam pulled them right in.
It was crazy how Luke and them went all over the ship without being found.
They used those Storm Trooper outfits.
I don't think that would work in reality.
But it worked in the movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Rancor from Return of the Jedi?
Yeah. That creature was terrifying. Where do you suppose Jabba got it?
I think that guard who was sad that it was killed raised it from a baby.
How did that guy get a baby Rancor?
Maybe he found it in a nest?
Do Rancors have nests?
I'm not sure. How else would a mama Rancor raise its offspring?
Just have it follow her around, maybe?
I wonder what Rancor meat tastes like.
Chicken, probably.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Kirk
...
What?..
That's STAR TREK!
Same thing!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?
Star... whatever!
This conversation is OVER!
Okay Tyler Durden
XXXXXXXXXXX
What in the world was that thing that Obi-Wan sliced his arm off in the bar?
You need to study up on your details dude. You really don't know?
No man I don't. It looked like some big walrus or something, really ugly.
That was Ponda Baba. He's an Aqualish and a smuggler.
Just like Han huh? What does he smuggle?
I don't know.....spices or something I think. He and the other dude worked for Jabba.
Man, Jabba had a real criminal empire going didn't he?
For sure, he was the Al Capone of Tatooine
Tatooine is one rough place. Either the sand people or one of the Hutts is going to get at you.
Yeah man, it's kind of like the country of Australia. Every living thing that's not human is deadly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Someone told me you love Star Wars Episodes I, II and III... WHY?
Because despite the poor performance in II and III, the set the tone for the later years...
Give me two reasons why they're better than the original films. I bet you can't!
I didn't say they were better. Just that they were great. I'll give you two factors that are improvements over the originals though. Number one: the CGI effect allowed for more creatures, more beautiful landscapes, more action than ever before.
Okay, I'll give you that one. The Naboo landscapes were gorgeous, and the underwater Gungan City were phenomenal. Reason number two?
It showed the origins of Anakin Skywalker, and the real reason why he turned to the dark side in the other films.
The real reason? Do you mean that he turned to the dark side when Padme was killed?
No, no, that's not what I mean. I mean, Anakin was never supposed to be a Jedi. He was never supposed to be good. It was only the love he received from his mother, from Qui-Gon, Padme and Obi-Wan that made him conflicted and want to be good. It was these warring factions inside himself that caused the emotional battles that ultimately brought balance to the force by his coming full circle.
I don't know what to say. I'm speechless. Great points. May the force be with you.
And also with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you much of a Star Wars fan?
I love Star Wars, it makes me think of growing up and watching them with my dad.
Yeah, takes me back too. Who is your favorite character?
Hans Solo, duh. He was a total stud.
Mine is R2D2. If I could have a droid, I would want it to be just like him.
Why's that?
Well, C3PO is cool, but he doesn't do well under pressure. R2D2 seems more loyal and collected.
That seems funny, to rate droids. Well, if we are picking droids then I think I would take BB8. Just his design itself is amazing.
Oh, BB8! I so want to buy that remote control toy of BB8 for my son. I think he would love it.
You can buy it for me, my birthday is coming up. Did my jedi mind trick work on you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the latest leak that says Luke was on that deserted planet looking for lost jedi artifacts?
I have heard that. And in the new trailer, he says something about the jedi coming to an end. I wonder what that means?
Well it's titled the last jedi. I assume he's the last jedi.
But why wouldn't he train Rey and have her become one as well? Maybe she's the last jedi?
It's really hard to say. Although I get the feeling that on Luke's journey, he's learned a lot of dark secrets about the jedi.
It really is amazing how far he's come since training on Dagobah with Yoda.
Yeah I guess all those piggy back rides really did him some wonders!
On another note, I really wish Yoda were still alive.
He's still around as a force ghost! You know Qui Gon Jinn originally learned that technique right?
Well yeah, according to Clone Wars canon, he did, and that's how he passed it on to Yoda. I wonder if the sith have any comparable techniques.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars movies?
Yes I do im a big fan actually.
Really? Im a big fan as well.
What do you like most about them?
I like the imagination aand the visual effects.
And what about characters?
My favorite is Anakin Skywalker before he turned into Darth Vader what about yours?
Well I like Chewbaca a lot.
Hes cool as well and what about villains.
I like Boba Fett the most.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Darth Vader moment?
I would say at the end of Rogue One when he decimated all those rebels.
Yes, that was an end to the rebel scum haha.
Also basically the whole movie of Empire Strikes back.
Agreed, the way he fought Luke, and choked out all the admirals that failed him.
I also liked when he first became Vader, and killed all the Padiwans at the temple.
Yeah, it was harsh but marked a moment where truly Anikan Skywalker was dead and Darth Vader had begun.
It was also impressive the way he was able to read Luke's mind in Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, dark side to perfection.
I guess we both know the true power of the dark side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
And how he develops the dual blade light saber.
That would've been cool to see also.
And why is the Sith saber's red?
That's a common knowledge. It's the negative energy from the Sith that turns them red.
How come Some Jedi's have blue and others green?
Green like Yoda's indicate he's a Jedi Consular who spent more time studying the mystical nature of the Force.
And if it's blue like Kenobi's?
That indicates he's a Jedi Guardian who's more in tune with the physical aspect of the Force, like fighting.
Oh... Ok. That makes sense. All this should've been explaiend in the movie.
That wiould make the movie 10 hours long. All these back stories developed over the past 3 decades.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Star Wars fan?
Yes, I love the Star Wars movies!
So who is your favorite character?
I really like Boba Fett, I feel like he's the mercenary of the Star Wars Universe.
Oh I love Boba Fett too!!  It's sort of strange that he's my favorite and yet I know anothing about the actor.
I never thought of that, but you're right.  Who plays him?
Jeremy Bulloch has played him the majority of the time.
Just when I thought I knew everything about Star Wars I learn something new.
It's true, there's just so many characters and settings and everything!  I love it.
Me too, let's go have a movie marathon of all the movies in order!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Chewbacca an iconic character?
Yes even without his dialogue.
I always fashioned him as comedic relief.
No way thats misguided.
I dont see how, I think he was crucial but not important
That seems like an oxymoron.
In The Empire Strikes Back I think he was important
OK so how do you feel about anything else?
I think he could have been played better
Thats a proposition I dont want to hear about it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I thought Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens was awesome!
Yeah, it was like a massive Death Star.
I wonder what the red dirt speeders in The Last Jedi trailer were?
I don't know - but it might be another cool Hoth battle except in the desert.
I wonder what they will do with Carrie Fisher in Episode IX?
Perhaps they will give her an honorable death at the beginning of the movie.
Did you enjoy Rogue One?
I thought it was wonderful, especially with the ending with Darth Vader.
Yes, that was the Darth Vader scene that we've always wanted.
I thought the Leia and Tarkin effects in Rogue One were awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you have a favorite Star Wars film?
I really enjoyed the Clone Wars.
Really, the clone wars?
Yeah is that bad?
No, just different.
Ah okay.
What did you like about that movie?
I liked the huge battle scenes and how you could see the storm troopers beginning to form up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Jar Jar.
Jar Jar Binks was cool
Was he a Sith Lord?
I don't know.
He seemed very silly.
Kind of like he was on drugs.
I got tired of him being stupid.
I guess kids liked him.
I think I would have liked him more if he didn't act so silly.
I reckon it was something different they tried.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what Star Wars movie they should make next?
What?
A Darth Maul spin-off.
We already had a Darth Maul spin-off series. It was called The Clone Wars.
He was only in like, 5 episodes!
And it was more than enough.
But there's gotta be more to tell!
They should the time before Episode I when he was training under Sidious, but why bother? It's a Sidious movie at that point which Maul happens to be in.
But his character was such a waste!
No, General Grievous was a waste. Maul eventually got character development, with a beginning, middle, and end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the prequals or the original trilogy
The original
I liked them both, they were different
They prequals used the green screen too much
There were some cool shots done digitally, but some parts should have been kept the same, like yoda
Some of the enviroments could not have been done in the 70s.
They need to use the green screen as little as they can
The ships should not be cgi
I hope they are not afraid to add some interesting characters in the new films
It has gotten a little monotenous
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard that they are making a new movie about Han Solo when he was younger?
That is crazy. I wonder what will happen in that movie.
Maybe they will show how Han first met Chewie.
They could also show how Han won the Millennium Falcon for the first time.
How funny would it be if they had him making the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs?
Ha, that would be funny. I just hope they stay true to his rogue like character.
Definitely. They need to go back to the Han who shot Greedo first instead of the Han that George Lucas tried to sanitize.
I heard Donald Glover is in the movie playing a young Lando Calrissian.
That should be good. Woody Harrelson is in it too.
I never thought I would see him in the Star Wars universe, but I guess anything is possible now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars Heroine
Princess lea of course
Why is that
Because she was tough and awesome
How was she tough and awesome?
She wasn't intimidated by the bad guys she stood up to them
How did she stand up to them?
She made fun of them
So the movie is funny too?
Yes she was very snarky and funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
Luke Skywalker is the worst character in Star Wars by far.
He's the grand master. How can you say that?
He's whiney and he runs and he's responsible for BILLIONS of deaths.
Elaborate.
Easy. He cried that one of his students turned and ran away to a planet to be by himself. Meanwhile, that student killed an entire star system.
Luke just sat there.
Yeah, kind of pathetic, right?
What do you think he's doing on that planet?
Probably waiting for the pity party to arrive.
Haha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who'd win in a fight, Leia or Rey?
Rey for sure.
But Leia has a blaster.
True, but Rey has the force!
Alright. How about in a straight up fist fight?
Gotta go with Leia.
Yeah. She'd beat Rey senseless!
Agree. What a tough lady.
Alright, Solo or Skywalker?
In a fist fight?
XXXXXXXXXXX
how about that force awakens?
i thought it was okay.
Didn't it seem like a copy of a new hope?
yeah, i guess it was kind of a reboot
I thought it was more of a straight up copy.
Nah, I think they're just trying to catch the attention of a new generation of fans
I guess that's true.
It's not like it was a horrible movie either.
Yeah, but I hope the next movie tells us much more.
I'm sure it will; the backstory of Rey.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Jedi in Star Wars?
I think they're awesome. And you?
Me too. Its interesting how some of their customs come from Eastern traditions.
I guess those customs were an influence on George Lucas at one point.
So the Jedi had their own style of martial arts.
Very cool right? And low-key at the same time.
And Jedi are supposed to fashion their own lightsabers.
Using a crystal, right?
Yes, the khyber crystal I think I heard.
I guess that accounts for the different colors of light coming off individual lightsabers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how much or little did you like the prequels?
I really liked all three. The phantom menace got alot of bad reviews though.
I agree I really liked all three.
I might've not gone with Hayden Christianson in Attack of the clones but the movie was great.
Yeah, I'm not a big fan of Christianson either.
My other critique is way too much CG.
Exactly! Yoda was different each movie.
They should have used the same puppet for Yoda that they used in Empire Strikes back.
True. They just used too many computer generated characters which made the movie feel fake.
Well that's the times we live in. Maybe the Last Jedi will be better?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first Star Wars movie you saw in theaters?
I saw The Phantom Menace when it came out.
Really? What was your favorite character?
I really liked Darth Maul, I thought his lightsabre was cool.
Do you think we'll ever see another double-bladed lightsabre?
I hope not, it's cooler if he was the only one to ever have one.
I wish he hadn't died though.
Yeah, too bad he couldn't have been the main villain for that series.
I wonder if there's a book about him or anything.
Maybe! We'll have to check.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how "realistic" would you say A New Hope, the first Star Wars movie, is?
Well, it's funny that you bring that up, because when you think of Star Wars as opposed to, like, a 1950s sci-fi movie, it becomes apparent.
You mean that it was revisionist, in the sense of how Westerns started to change?
Yes, I think so, because certain tropes get played around with.
Like Princess Leia as a damsel in distress, or Chewbacca as a big scary creature...
Sure, and what people say a lot is that the Star Wars universe looks "lived-in."
Like an old pair of jeans, you mean?
Yeah, exactly -- characters wear kind of rough, worn-out looking garments, especially on Tattooine, and the ships look kind of broken down.
Whereas in those 1950s movies, there is a kind of postwar optimism in how we see the future...
Sure, everything is shiny and new, but in Star Wars, it's a galaxy that's a lot more like our own sort of drab world.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite, non jedi/sith character?
Hmm, I would have to say boba fett. He was a real badass.
Yeah, he was one of the most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy.
So, whats your favorite then?
Mine would be R2D2. I love how all he can do is make noises. I think he is just funny.
Haha, interesting. He plays a big role in helping jedi very much.
Yeah he really does, and I feel like a lot of it goes unappreciated.
He was definitely the best droid in the entire series, that's for sure.
Yeah, I liked him a lot more than C-3PO because C-3PO talked way too much.
Haha, he did, and to make it worse he was always insulting R2D2 and making him look bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the music from The Revenge of the Jedi?
Yes, I love all of John WIlliams music.
You can hear certain music, and know exactly who the music is referring too.
I know, Darth Vador's music is memorable.
I also like the celebration music at the end.
But didn't the music change from the original version.
I think so, I seem to remember if being a little more upbeat, and some words being sung.
Yes, I want to say right before the fade out to the credits I remember the words Celebrate the Law.
And the Ewoks banging the drums didn't quite match the music on the new version.
I wonder why they changed it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Would you call yourself a fan of Star Wars?
Yeah I would say so.
Who is your favorite character from the films?
I love Lando.
Really, why?
Well Billy D. Williams is just so cool.
Yeah that is true.
And he's got a sweet cape.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the original trilogy again and I'm not sure how I feel about return of the Jedi.
Why?  That had a great story about the redemption of Vader, and Luke finally becoming a full Jedi.
Yeah, that was amazing, as were the effects as always.  But those Ewoks man.
I hear you, they were the low point of the movie.  But they were pretty awesome in that big battle.
I guess you're right.  Plus kids love them too.
Yeah, and how about when Luke and Leah revealed they really are siblings?
For sure, and Leah has force powers that Luke is someday going to teach her.
I'd like to see that, see how strong she is next to her twin brother.
They should be equals.
I agree, that would be a great movie.  Maybe for Episode 8.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any favorite quote or quotes from the Star Wars movies?
My favorite quote was by Admiral Ackbar.
What movie did this take place in?
I think it happened in the Return of the Jedi.
What was happening in the scene?
I think I remember them going into battle with the Imperial Fleet.
What did Admiral Ackbar say?
Admiral Ackbar told everyone that, "It's a trap!"
I remember that, it was hilarious!
I know, that's why it's my favorite of all time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any star wars movies recently?
I saw number three.
Oh cool, were you into that one?
Yeah it was interesting.
What was your favorite part?
I loved the part where anakin became darth vader.
That was so cool. I keep replaying that clip.
It was awesome hearing the voice for the first time again.
Oh yeah totally.
I had a blast talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, what did you think of Force Awakens?
Weeel... I don't know.  It was okay, I guess.  I mean, it was good to see Star Wars again, but I really they retread the plot of the first film too much.
How so?
Really?  You need to ask?  Well, let's start at the beginning...
Okay.
We got a young protagonist on a desert planet (again), and she find a droid that has secret plans the bad guys want.
Yeah, it does sound kind of familiar.
She finds out she has talents she doesn't know about and goes to get advice from a short alien.
Yeah, see what you mean.. we even have a big planet destroyer again.
Exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you have a favorite star wars movie ?
do i ! its the first one. i still watch it from time to time.
ya me too.
i remember when it first came out. i was 12 and in the 7th grade it was 1977.
a whole group of my friends went to go see it at the theater.
in my small town there was only one theater and the line to see star wars went all the way around the block.
i thought it was a good movie back then. now it seems even better.
ya i know what you mean. its relevant because in our government the republicans have become the empire. right ? that is what you mean ?
oh totally ! we need luke skywalker and hans solo r2d2 and cp3o to come and save us from the evil empire.
donald trump is really darth vader!! oh thats funny. well see you, nice talking to you. this is my stop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
A lot of people disliked the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Was there anything about them that you did like?
Yes, at the end of the day it's still Star Wars so I'm willing to forgive an awful lot. For example I thought Ewan McGregor did a great job playing Obi Wan Kenobi.
What about Jar Jar Binks? He seems to be the most hated Star Wars character.
Personally, I didn't dislike him as much as everyone else did. That doesn't mean I liked him but I don't really see what all the anger is about.
What's some other stuff you liked about the prequels?
The pod race scene in Phantom Menace was fun. Maybe it went on a little too long but it was exciting.
The lightsaber action i the prequels was pretty intense. There was much more of it than in the original trilogy.
That's true but it loses a lot of its mystique when people break out their lightsabers at the drop of a hat. I kind of preferred them to be used sparingly.
It was cool seeing Anakin become Darth Vader throughout the three movies.
Yeah the scenes near the very end of Revenge of the Sith where they show him actually putting the mask on were something Star Wars fans had been wanting to see for years!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the last jedi?
Yes definitely.
I wonder who snoke really is?
I heard many theories out there.
Yeah, one is that he was mace Windu, one thing even said Jar Jar Binks.
Ha, that is crazy, but I think that he is something completely different.
The most interesting thing that I heard was that in the same way the Yoda is extremly powerful an an unidentified speices, that snoke is the same verison.but evil.
Yeah, I heard like an ancient Jedi order more powerful than modern jedi.
That would be an interesting twist.
I think it is that myself, we will see when it is released.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the original Star Wars last night.Did you ever see that one?
Not the whole movie, just bits and pieces on T.V..
You should rent it. I think George Lucas had no clue what he was starting with that movie.
How old were you when that came out?
I was only eleven. It came out in 1977.
Wow, that is an oldie. I saw one of the newer ones called The Clone Wars.
I saw them all. That was good but you could tell Lucas had nothing to do with it.
I guess I would have to see them all to tell the difference. How many movies all together?
I think there were at least ten movies. I could be wrong.
The Force Awakens was supposed to be good too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The X-wind fighters in STAR WARS are cool.
It was cool when Luke would be in one.
And R2-D2 would be in the back.
And the wings could close or make an X.
And each part of the wing had a gun on it.
They had 4 engines also.
It was cool when they would chase the Tie Fighters.
It was like back in the day when airplanes would chase each other.
And they would wear high altitude flight outfits.
I bet the go quick.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can't wait to see the next Star Wars installment.
Yeah it looks like it'll be good. What's the name of it again?
It's called Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
Wow with a name like that you can expect something crazy to happen.
Some people think that Luke Skywalker is the Last Jedi.
Maybe he is planning on starting something totally separate from the Jedi and Sith.
That would make a lot of sense since they said he was the one to bring balance to the force.
He could start a new group that will utilize both the light and dark side of the force.
Maybe Rey is the missing key to it all.
Daisy Ridley is awesome as Rey. I can't wait to see what she has in store for us.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the star wars story rogue one?
I loved it. Did you not?
I thought it was amazing. I loved that they did not go for a happy ending.
Ya  the film especially towards the end had such high stakes.
You knew they were going to die and they knew that too. But yet such bravery.
They were on a mission. I am glad they completed it , but wished they could have lived somehow just because I enjoyed them so much,
I enjoyed the characters and the actors playing them too. But like I said glad they ended it the way they did had so much impact.
Yes, it was certainly impactful, I cried.
It was one of my favorite films of the star wars world.
I think it was executed so well and the script was written so well too. Everything in the movie felt truly captivating.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you think about Jar Jar?
As little as possible! I don't think he was quite as bad as people say, though.
Oh, did you like him?
Not really, I just think some people took their dislike a little too seriously. They overthought it.
Don't you feel that he was over the top?
Yes, but he also fit the youthful theme on the first prequel. I think each movie had it's own feel.
How So?
Episode one was childhood, Episode two was our teen years. Episode 3 was becoming an adult.
Wow, now you are overthinking things.
Maybe so, but if you evaluate them individually, they work a lot better than if you compare them to the original trilogy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy the Force Awakens.
I did, made me cry though.
Oh, when Han died?
Yes, the whole scene. Him meeting his son again.
And then boom, he died. It was really anticlimatic.
I think that was the point. That death was easy for Kylo Ren, even patricide.
I cried when the Wookie wailed.
Chewie? That was the saddest part, he did not want to leave his friend.
I was sad Rey did not get to know him better, she admired him.
I was glad she did a little bit, she got to meet and know him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you read any of the expanded universe novels?
I have, I was really upset when they made all the old novels part of the expanded universe instead of cannon.
Yes, I agree. That was very disappointing.
What was your favorite series?
I was a fan of the New Jedi Order series the most.
Me too! I also liked the Young Jedi Knights series about the solo kids when they were young.
Yeah the fact that they were the focus of many of the books but their stories were erased from cannon was a hard pill to swallow.
I could see not really caring if you never read the books but if you did read them than it was very depressing to know you will never see them in movies.
I hope they do some expanded universe films in the future, I want to see some movies with Anakin, Jacen and Jaina so bad!
Maybe eventually they will, but they have a lot of movies planned for the future so it will probably be awhile before they do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Phantom Menace.
It wasn't the best, but not the worst.
I didn't like the kid  who played Anakin.
Why not?
He was a little too cute for me.
I see what you mean.  Who did you like?
Natalie Portman was super hot, even in makeup.
I agree with that.
The Sith guy was super cool, though.
I liked Liam Neeson as Obi-wan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Episodes 4 5 and 6 recently, what should I watch next?
You should watch Episodes 1 2 and 3 next!
Are they any good? I've heard mixed reviews
They are great, don't worry about the haters
What do the haters say?
They don't like the plot, Jar Jar Binks, or sometimes the cheesy effects
I will watch them today!
Will you have time?
Yeah, I will start with Episode 1 and see Young Anakin!
he is a great character who earns to fight well and he changes a lot so pay attention!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old were you when Star Wars came out?
I wasn't even born yet. That was before my time.
Are you familiar with the movies?
The only one I've seen is A New Hope. I'm going to watch The Force Awakens tomorrow.
You should really watch them in chronological order so you can understand everything.
You know, I've been making it a point to do that. Maybe I'll do it over the next two days and then see The Force Awakens this weekend.
That's a good idea. I know you're going to enjoy them.
I'm sure I will, I love epic sagas and that's definitely a huge one.
George Lucas is a genius. I heard he created the languages for the movies, and they have actual translations.
Really? That's incredible. That's real dedication to your work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is universally acknowledged that "The Empire Strikes Back" is the best Star Wars movie.  Do you agree?
Yes, clearly.
What's the worst Star Wars movie?
The first 2 prequels.
I tend to agree, although recently I watched "The Return of the Jedi," and it was pretty bad.
Really, I remember liking it.  Of course, I was a kid.
It shares many of the bad tendencies of the prequels: cuteness, too much (bad) dialogue, fuzzy action.
I thought "The Force Awakens" was a return to form, and may even be the second or third best of the films.
You'd put it ahead of the original?
I think that argument could be made.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I would have to say Han Solo.
I've always liked Princess Leia because of her dry humor.
She's a good one. I think there was a lot of Carrie Fisher in the character.
I also like how she's the classic damsel in distress in Epsiode IV, but immediately takes charge upon being rescued.
She's an early progressive example of a strong female character in film.
How did you feel about CG Leia in Rogue One?
It didn't bother me since it was only one shot. Tarkin was a lot more awkward.
I can't help but think there coule have been some way around having no Peter Cushing that wouldn't have looked so dumb.
They should have taken notes from Young Robert Downey Jr. in Captain America: Civil War.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I didn't realize that Disney had readapted Winnie the Pooh in 2011!
How did you miss it?
I was out of the country that year. I guess it wasn't released or promoted very much in the country I was in.
Hmm. That's surprising to me.
Was it any good?
I liked it okay. Winnie the Pooh is always such a heartwarming story.
It brings me right back to my childhood. I think I'm going to rent it tonight.
You should. And you know what you should have as a snack while you watch it?
What?
A big pot of honey!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Some say the best Star Wars movie is The Empire Strikes Back - your thoughts?
Well, from a storyline and script perspective, but in terms of movie-making and cultural significance, it has to be episode IV, A New Hope (i.e., the original).
Yeah, but in terms of movie itself, don't you have to say that Empire Strikes Back...
Let me interrupt you right there. No, Stars Wars -- the first one -- revolutionized the movie industry. Summer blockbusters, product tie-ins, catering to a youth market. We are still living in the consequences of this.
Yes, I see what you are saying, but just in terms of a movie itself, much of the story and dialogue of the original is so corny, hackneyed, and B-rate.
True, and if memory serves me correctly, Lawrence Kasdan wrote the second screenplay and it was more nuanced, believable, adult, and mature.
Are you still holding onto your opinion that the original Star Wars is the "best"?
Yes, it's not really even a debate when factoring in cultural impact and significance, which you have to.
Jaws had a similar cultural impact, but would you say Jaws is a better movie then say, Citizen Kane or The Seventh Seal?
No, but you're creating a straw man argument there. Star Wars is almost like a religion, and it's impact has to be taken into account when evaluating all of the movies in the franchise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I told you earlier about one possible Return of the Jedi ending, want to hear another?
Sure, why not?
George Lucas toyed with the idea of killing Han Solo at the end and leaving the rebels broken?
That would have been a downer of an ending.
He apparently nixed the idea as he worried about toy sales.
Probably a smart move on his behalf.
So he decided it would be better to just have a big old Ewok party.
And party they did!
Toy sales really drive so much added volume that you have to account for that factor.
Merchandising, merchandising, merchandising!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rey's imagination bothers me.
Why?
She's flying to a planet with Han and Chewie and says "I didn't know there was this much green in the galaxy"
So?
Well, clearly she'd have known there are endless planets.
You think it's a character weakness that she thinks this one planet has more green than any other?
Yes, do you have a better idea?
Of course.
Let's hear it.
It's a metaphor. She's from a desert. Get over it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Christensen as Aniken?
He was alright.
I didn't really think to much of him.
It was cool that he insited on wearing the Vader suit in Episode III.
Yeah, gotta give him props for that.
They had to have him wear stilts.
That must have been uncomfortable.
I love that last battle with Obi-Wan.
Probably the best duel in the franchise.
Second maybe Yoda Sidious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think Supreme Leader Snoke is?
I'm not sure. I've heard all sorts of theories from Emperor Palpatine to Darth Vader.
I'm not sure they would go that way. I think it is a new character.
Sure, but I bet they will tie the backstory into the Sith we know.
You never know, they could do something completely out of left field and make him loosely or non-affiliated with the Sith.
Woah, I never thought of that. That could be cool.
What if they made it like he thought he was "improving the Sith"?
That's an interesting take on things. But I bet they stick to what people know.
True.
Should be exciting either way!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what's you favorite Star Wars scene?
Well. mine would have to be the fight over the Sarlacc pit in Return of the Jedi.
Okay, that's a good one, my favorite part is is when R2 zapps Salacious Crumb.
Yeah, because he was eating 3PO's eyes.
And my next favorite part is when Han Solo accidently activated Boba Fett's jetpack.
Yeah, and he falls into the Sarlacc Pit and it belches after it swallows him.
But of course, we can't forget Princess Leia and the golden bikini.
Of course not, that's the ultimate in nerd fan service.
Though, Carrie FIsher managed to make the look kind of tough, when she strangles Jabba.
Yep, old Jabba should have kept a closer eye on her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch star wars
Of course
Yea i think almost everyone has
They are great movies
I love the droids
Me too
Which one do you like
I really like C3PO
Hes one of my favorites too
Hes awesome
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ugh, I hate all the hype about Star Wars.
What? You don't like Star Wars?
I hate it! The movies are so bad.
Are you kidding? Have you seen them all?
No, Just the one's that came out in the 90s.
Oh, those one's were pretty bad.
Yeah, they were awful.
Well you should try watching the old ones, or the new one that came out in 2015. They were so much better.
Really? I kind of figured they were bad too.
No, the 90s one's were awful but the new one especially is really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Force awakens is not that good.
What? It's so cool, HAN, LEIA AND CHEWY, too cool.
You just named the problem, the old characters are more interesting that the new ones.
Jon Boyega was great as the deserting storm trooper.
You dont even remember his character's name? That is exctly the problem.
Well no, but that does not mean the movie's not that good.
I can remember the names of the characters from even some of the old Star Wars movies I did not like.
Rey, I remember Rey from the Force Awakens.
Who's the bad guy who killed Han?
Gee, I dont know. Darth Maul?
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you wanna see in new star wars
more darth maul to be honest
why?
what do you mean?
he is dead
he was such a cool character though
they did have a show about him
yeah but i want a real video
i can see that
lets do it, disney
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the Lando Calirissan character from Star Wars?
Yeah, he was great.
Yeah, at first a swindler and city manager of Cloud city...
...and then a general in the end.
yeah, that seemed a bit of a stretch.
I guess the rebellion was pretty desperate for leaders.
I wonder whatever happened to him
Yeah, they never talked about him in the Force Awakens
I hope they somehow integrate him in the next new one
yeah, that would be great
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Star Wars: The Force Awakens?
Yes, I thought that movie was so cool.
I did too. It might even be my favorite Star Wars film.
I loved that they decided to use real sets and costumes.
I agree. It felt like a tribute to the original films.
They did a great job with character development, too.
Definitely. I already care about all of the characters they introduced.
I'm hoping they explore Rey's control of the force more in the next film.
I'm sure they will. Her character is so mysterious and interesting.
A lot of people are saying that she could be a Skywalker. I can't wait to find out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the new Star Wars movie?
The Last Jedi?
Yes, I think that's the name.
When is it coming out?
I believe it's coming out in December of 2017
Sure, I'm excited.  I love Star Wars
I haven't watched the trailer but it's on my schedule.
That's great! I know the last movie was awesome.
What was the name of the last one?
The name of the last movie was Rogue One.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like most about Yoda?
Well, I think Yoda is one of the coolest characters in all the Star Wars movies. I'd have to think about it.
Well, I really like how he lives in the middle of no where in a swamp.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
So have you thought about what you like best about him yet?
I think it's really cool that he lived for hundreds of years.
Yeah, it's hard to believe how long Yoda was around.
You would think that after all that time, he would be stronger than any Sith Lord.
Well, some of them master the force faster than others, like Annakin did.
That's true, I just wish Yoda was more powerful I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wa thinking about doing a Star Wars marathon this weekend.
That sounds cool. What order?
I haven't decided yet. Release order or numerical order, what do you think?
I'm a traditionalist. I like to start with A New Hope.
That's how I usually do it, but I was thinking about starting with The Phantom Menace.
Do you have the original movies or the remastered ones?
Both! I collect every DVD as soon as it comes out.
Me too. Plus I see them in theater as soon as they open.
Same here. I only missed one of them, and that's because I was a baby.
Lucky you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Empire Strikes Back is not as good as the original Star Wars
How can you say that? Empire is awesome
Star Wars had to create a universe people would be interested in. Empire just expanded it a bit and added a dumb twist
A dumb twist? it set up one of the best conflicts ever.
They had to retcon all the Luke and Leia stuff to make it make sense.But its still creepy
Since they didnt know they were related the stuff in Star Wars comes off as harmless flirting.
It still seems like they added that after the fact rather than having a master plan. Star Wars is a complete experience on its own
I agree that Star Wars built a great world but Empire gave it emotion.
All the emotion was present in the first film to use. They didn't have to add a silly soap opera plot to expand it
It wouldn't be the Skywalker Saga without a bit of soap opera melodrama to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you name all the robots in the Star Wars series?
No. But C3PO was my favorite Star Wars robot character.
I thought C3PO was a droid not a robot.
You probably thought R2D2 was beer keg and a bottle opener on wheels didn't you?
No but C3PO sounded alot like Dr. Smith on the television series "Lost In Space."
Dr. Smith was a man not a robot like C3PO, R2D2 and what's other one named?
You mean BB8, the robot that looked like an orange and white soccer ball.
I wonder what George Lucas was thinking when he added these robots to his screenplay?
I'm sure Lucas thought the robots were made for good visual entertainment.
Are there any gay characters or gaybots in Star Wars?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, in Star Wars, are droids alive?
No, they're not.
But they have like souls or consciousness or something?
They're not part of the force, so no. They might sentient or sapient though.
But doesn't Yoda say in Empire that the force flows through all things, even rocks and droids and stuff?
The force is everywhere, but not everything is connected to it in that way. Like rocks, droids aren't.
Okay, but R2 is clearly self-aware, and practically a living being.
But he's still a non-living machine. And most droids never even get his level of self-awareness.
So when a droid dies that's it? They don't join the force?
No, but they can always be rebuilt. That's the upside to being a droid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if the new Han Solo movie will be good?
That is difficult to say, although they did hire Ron Howard.
A good director is essential.
I wonder if we will learn more about Wookies.
If nothing else, we should see the origin of Han and Chewbacca.
Has the home planet been shown before?
I do not believe so, unless you count the Christmas special on television.
That would definitely be a mistake!
I am also looking forward to learning more about Lando.
Definitely!    Hope Donald Glover learned something from the coolest - Billy Dee Williams!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Do you know about Star Wars?
I know a little bit about it.
Have you seen all the films?
I have seen most of them.
Do you have one that you like the best?
I really liked Rogue One a lot.
Is that the newest one that came out?
Yeah I think so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any star wars movies lately?
Yeah I saw the Empire Strikes Back.
I really liked Marc Hamil's perfomance in that movie.
Me too. He really stood out especially against vader.
What did you think of Carrie Fisher's character?
Well she also does an amazing job.
I agree.
What was your favorite part?
When Vader tells luke he is his father.
That was classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on the remastering of Episodes 4, 5, and 6?
Well, that's a tough question.  On one hand, it allows Lucas to fulfill his vision of the universe.
How is that the case?
Well, better special effects allows him to make every shot look exactly like he thought.
That sounds like it's a good thing, overall.
It certainly could be, but don't you think that this diminishes from the original work?
How do you figure so?  The original was rife with poor special effects!
That's true!  But somebody on the production team made those special effects.
Ah, so you're claiming that by redoing those effects, you're removing those artist's work from the movies.
Exactly!  And because the original versions aren't also released, save on VHS, we may lose those forever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is you all time favorite star wars character?
I think yoda is up there for me. He is so wise and masterful.  What about you?
I love yoda, so quote worthy. but I have to go with han solo.
I like Han too. But why do you like him most?
I love his wit. I also love his one liners.
Very enjoyable character. Did you know that Harrison Ford was responsible for his response of "I KNOW"  to the I love you.
Yes, I did. I think that is such an iconic moment. Ford was really on the money. I think that may veen be my favorite line of Han solo's.
I agree, it is everything the character of Han is about. Ego, wit, charm.  I wonder if ford is upset Han died .
Maybe , but I think he is getting old and maybe knew he could not do it forever either.
I was glad he was alive to play the role and not have to make a substitute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite location in the Star Wars movies?
I can't remember all that many. I guess Tatooine?
Why Tatooine?
Well, it always felt like the home base for Star Wars. Both Anakin and Luke grew up there.
That makes sense.
What about you?
I kind of like Hoth.
The ice planet?
Yeah. I'm really into the winter aesthetic.
It did look really cool there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do Wookies and Ewoks come from the same evolutionary background?
I have no idea. They are both furry and can speak. They're both intelligent creatures.
If you shrunk a wookie and made him a little pudgy, he'd look just like an ewok.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
They both live up in the trees don't they?
Yes, they share that characteristic.
Do wookies worship all things golden like ewoks?
I don't think so. They are definitely smarter creatures.
They are both mild tempered in most ways and can be a little vicious.
That's right, I bet they do share the same origins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rey is a Skywalker?
You mean Luke's daughter?
No, Leia's daughter with Han Solo.
Wouldn't that make her a Solo?
Well, half Skywalker anyway.
Maybe she was conceived by the force, like Anakin was.
I hope they don't go down that road again.
I thought it was cool.
Not me, young Anakin was just too much for me.
So I guess you don't want a prequel for Rey?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
I've seen some, but definitely  not all. How many are there?
I'm not sure. I think there are maybe seven that have been made so far.
Yeah, i definitely saw the original three made back in the day.
Yeah me too. And i've seen three of the newer ones.
I think i've only seen two. I know the last one was The Force Awakens, but i didn't see it
Yeah, that's the one i have not seen.
Great films though. There's like a whole mythology to them with some interesting spiritual concepts thrown in
Yes, i agree. There's definitely some philosophical stuff in them
Yes, thought provoking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Kylo Ren can be forgiven for killing Han Solo?
He slayed his father. It seems like he's made his choice.
Yeah, but he felt conflicted about it. Maybe he'll turn out to be a good guy.
He seems to have taken a side in the conflict decisively, though.
But he was just being manipulated by Snoke.
And Darth Vader was just being manipulated by Palpatine.
Darth Vader died in redemption.
He only saw redemption in death, so maybe that's what will happen to Kylo Ren.
I could see him sacrificing himself to make up for it.
That would leave the Solo family with no surviving members, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Star Wars films?
Oh yes, I'm a big fan so I've seen all of the movies many times. I almost have the dialogue memorized.
What was your opinion on Rogue One? Do you think it was as good as the main Star Wars films?
I liked it very much. It was good to see some backstory for how the Rebel Alliance was able to capture the plans for the Death Star.
I liked it too. It had a slightly more dark tone than the main series.
It was definitely grittier than other Star Wars movies.
One amazing thing about the movie was the totally CGI characters, Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Princess Leia.
Yes, on a technical level I was very impressed with the quality of the CGI. Just a few years ago such a thing would have been impossible.
So what was your favorite thing about Rogue One?
The entire third act with the epic space battle was just incredible. Probably the battle sequence out of all Stars Wars movies so that's saying a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about star wars
Alright
Who os your favorite character
Yoda definitely
What about you
Princess leia
Of course the girl
Shes so pretty
And i love when carrie fisher player her
Thats true
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite vehicle in star wars.
The X wing.
That one is cool. What do you like about it?
It seems like it might actually fly.
It looks a little inefficient.
It seems like the wings would rip off when it goes fast.
It is the wrong shape.
It has too many wings.
It looks easier to fly than the tie fighter
I wonder why only the Rebels use it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like star wars?
Yeah sure.
Do you have a favorite character from the films?
I really like Han Solo.
Yeah he's great.
What about you?
I like Luke.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read an interesting fact about Liam Neeson today.
Go on, I'm listening.
Apparently, he's pretty tall, like 76 inches or so I think.
Okay, where's this going?
Apparently, he was so tall they had to redo the sets for him?
Really?  Did they not make them big enough?
I guess the door frames were too small for him so they had to raise them up.
That seems like a pretty big mixup between the designers and casting.
It apparently cost them $150,000 to make them bigger.
That's a lot of cash spent on simple timber!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you disappointed that little Anakin Skywalker turned out to be Darth Vader?
Yes, because he started out as a cute kid with a happy personality.
His character was so fun and likable in Phantom Menace especially during and after the pod race!
I liked it when he was older in Attack of Clones and was romantically interested in Padme and she in him.
I know, right! You could totally see them getting together. Hayden Christensen is a very handsome young man.
What happened to him? Why did he go to the Dark Side?
I think it had something to do with his separation from his mother and the huge fear he had of losing Padme.
I think you're right. That fear in him, the kind that makes people do irrational things, turned him to the Dark Side.
I'm so glad George Lucas came out with prequel series otherwise we would have had no idea why Darth Vader said, "Luke, I am your father"!
Me too! The Star Wars series has been one of my favorites since they started back in the mid-1970s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, with The Last Jedi coming out this Christmas, do you think Luke's gonna die?
No way, man, Luke's too important for the series.
I don't know, all the actors are getting pretty old now.
Yeah, but Luke's the only one left now, since Han's dead and Leia's actress died.
I guess that's true, but they didn't know that and they might have already killed him off before that.
I think it'd be too repetitive to kill Luke off right after Han died. Besides, someone has to teach Rey!
That's true, but they could always use force ghosts.
That's true. Do you think Obiwan will show up any?
I sure hope so, he's my favourite character from the prequels.
Well, he was in the originals too, but I get what you mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like there's a lot to like about the Star Wars franchise.
One of the thing's I've always liked is the merchandise.
Like all of the toy light sabers and things like that?
Yeah. It's a great way to expose kids to it.
I remember that stuff being especially popular around that time of Episode 3.
Revenge of the Sith, right? I get some of the prequels mixed up.
Yeah, that's it. I really didn't think it was as bad as others seem to.
I agree. It's just that the prequels tried to be a little too kid friendly.
I get that, but I still don't mind it.
I can respect that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Princess Leai will get a solo film?
Like how they are making a Han Solo one?
Yes, do you think they will show her life before a New Hope.
I hope so, she was so brave in the films.
I think it would be sad since the actress that played her passed away.
Carrie Fisher, that was sad.
I wish they would make some movie or at least show what she was doing between films.
I always wondered why she ended up a princess.
The movies do not give a real good back story as to how or why she ended up on Alderan.
And they left Luke on the sand planet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm impressed at the amount of merchandise that Star Wars has pumped out all these years.
I'm a pretty big fan of the video games.
Are you a fan of the films at all?
Not really, but I really like the way the lore has translated to video games. It fits extremely well.
I kind of agree. I just wish there was some more resemblance to the films.
So basically movie tie-in games?
Yeah, basically that. That's just me, though.
Movie tie-ins generally aren't very good, though.
Still, an Empire Strikes Back game never hurt anyone.
Maybe, but you might be disappointed after playing it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Star Wars "Revenge of the Sith" it is still a great movie to watch.
I saw it on TV the other day.
I like all the special effects in all the Star Wars movies.
Yeah,  me too.Have you played any" Star Wars" video games?
No! but I heard they are a lot of fun.
I just love Luke Skywalker.
Yeah, I heard he is suppose to be in" Star Wars 8".
I wonder is Yoda is going to be in episode 8?
That would be cool if he is.
Yeah, we have not seen him lately.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who has the coolest lightsaber?
Jeez, i like mace windus purple saber.
thats a good one. purple is awesome.
its my favorite color. Yoda's is cool too.
what about the siths
I like darth mauls double saber.
That was iconic. i like kylos sword saber thing.
Thats pretty damn cool too.
maul is a bit cooler though because of his moves with it.
indeed. thats my second favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Anakin when he was an adult?
I thought he was sort of flat.
I agree. They should not have cast the guy they did.
He should have been less of a complainer.
Yes and they should not have had that love story.
I agree. I also did not like making him a kid.
They should have just left that story altogether.
I think that character only works as Darth Vader. Keep his history a mystery.
Yes. It was a mistake to try to go through his journey.
Yeah. But, at least we can forget the prequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Did you hear they are making a movie about Lando?
Really?
Yeah.
Who is playing the lead?
Donald Glover.
Who is that?
The guy from community and also he raps as Childish Gambino.
Oh cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like The Force Awakens?
Yes, but I liked Rogue One Better.
Yeah, it was good, especially how they maanged to incorporate Moff Tarkin into it.
Yeah, the actor got Peter Cushing's mannet down very well, and the CGI did wonders superimposing his face on to him.
Personally, I though they could have given a bit more to Princess Leia, but what they did do was pretty good.
Did you like the ending?
It was okay, but I'd have liked Cassian and Jyn to have survived.
That would have been okay, but you have to admit the the Darth Vader comabt scene was great.
It was, if fact it showed you why Darth Vader is such a feared figure in the Star Wars Universe.
It did do that, and it was an awesome scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate how there is so much CGI in the new Star Wars.
It was the worst was in the prequel movies.  And then they had to go add some to the original.
I hated all of the added scenes that they put into the original.  The original felt more real.
That's because they used puppets instead of CGI. Much better in my opinion.
There was one scene that was better with CGI though.
Which one was that?
The Yoda fight scene where he bounces all around the room.
I do love that scene.  But I do prefer my Yoda as a puppet.
His original form was definitely the best.
And his voice is so iconic.  He is one of the reasons it is such a popular movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars has created so much memorable things in pop culture.
I agree. And not just characters.
That's why I said so much memorable things. There's things like worlds, races, weapons, spacecraft, and so much more.
Don't forget about the robots!
Right. The robots are just as memorable as some of the other characters.
R2-D2 is my younger cousin's favorite character in the entire film series.
Really? I get that they're young, but why R2?
That's just it. They're still young, and they find R2 to be funny.
I guess I need to be a little more open minded.
Don't worry about it. You're fine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars?
Ive never seen them
Really?
Is that suprising?
I thought everyone has seen them
Sorry to disappoint
Its cool you should check them out though
I might
Great, i gope you like them
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you think The Last Jedi will be?
Not sure but I hope it doesnt focus around Leia's death
Do we know she will die?
Well she did in real life so I imagine thats what they do
They could CGI her for as long as they need.
They could also have her die off screen.
I hope Kylo Ren has a bigger role.
He had a huge role what are you talking about?
Some times evil needs to triumph good
This is Disney though
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Akikan killing all of the young Jedis?
It's awful of course.
But I mean, do you think that it is consistent with his character?
Well, you don't obviously.   I mean, he is Darth Vader.
But I thought it was the death of Padame and the thought of loosing his kids that drove him over the edge.
Why did you think that?
Well, when Darth Vader dies defending Luke, I kind of thought that the loose of family was what drove him nuts.
I see your point. That the death of family is what drive him nuts.
I think the idea that his ambition was that blood thirsty was a bit out of characer.
Yeah, but he was evil.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen Star Wars right?
Yes of course one of my favorite set of movies.
Good have a question for you.
Go ahead.
Do you think Luke and Lea could have been happy if Luke was never a Jedi or had any powers to begin with?
That's a hard question in short yes and no.
Why do you think that?
Yes because what drew them apart was Luke and his power rage if you will.
Now why no?
What also drew them together was Luke and that he was a Jedi they would never have even met if it wasn't for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I know you love the original Star Wars trilogy.
Yes, I am a fan of those 3 films, definitely.
Lucas "enhanced" Star Wars when he got the chance. Is there anything you would change about them, if you had a chance?
Not like Lucas did - that's taking perfectionism a little too far, if you ask me.
But you would change something?
Well, everyone would change that scene with Han in Star Wars where he uses "parsecs" as a unit of time instead of distance. That was embarrassing - for Lucas, who wrote that line.
Would you have Greedo shoot first?
Hell no, it was fine the way it was. Greedo was a bad dude and threatening to boot.
Anything else?
In Return of the Jedi, when Luke tells Leia they're siblings, her reaction is so understated, it almost doesn't register. I would have "made the moment" a little more strongly, given it the importance it deserved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe return of the jedi came out in 1983
I know it was so long ago
Still such a great movie
I ahree
Im glad hans solo and princess leia are together
They belong together
They do, they are the best couple
So cute
Star wars has everything
Yes it does
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they will ever kill Luke off?
Well Mark Hamill cant work forever
Yeah and I mean his character will get old.
Thats a stranger way to go.
I think that they will have him get killed soon
He is in a self imposed exile.
I dont think thats how he will
So will he be fighting
Yeah I think theyll have him come back in that kind of role
Thats an interesting take
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's a better droid, BB8 or R2D2?
I think I prefer R2D2
Really? I prefer BB8
Why?
Because he has more personality and can do more things.
Personality? Droids don't have personality
What are you talking about, just think of C-3PO
Yeah, I guess you're right
In the end they were both great characters
Agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How is your favorite Star Wars character?
Original trilogy, prequels, or modern?
Original Trilogy.
Ok. Salacious Crumb.
Who is Salacious Crumb?
He is the little monkey rat guy who sits on Jabba's shoulder.
Haha, I know him, why him?
Well 2 reasons. I wonder if he is like a cat, or a dog, or sentient, like a man.
That is a deep question. 2?
I like his laugh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars alien do you like best?
I mean, I've always liked Chewbacca.
I do too. What is he again?
He's a Wookie. At least I think that's what they're called.
Oh yeah, Wookies! I think I like Yoda better though.
Yoda was really cool in Empire Strikes Back.
I always thought he might have been made a little too cuddly though.
His scenes in the prequels make up for that.
Yeah, he really comes into his own there.
It's great to watch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about Rogue One?
Yes I saw it when it debuted.
I believe its coming to Netflix.
The movie?
They are writing it to become a series.
See thats way too much
Once Lucas ceded control you knew this would happen.
But would people tune into that?
Absolutely, its money in the bank.
I just dont know if you can connect Rogue One with the regular film series in such a manner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch movies
Yes, star wars are my favorite
Mine too
Thats cool
Did you see the newest one
Yes it was really good
It comes on starz this weekend
Ill have to rewatch it
I probably will too
Thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like The Force Awakens?
I really didn't.
No? Why not?
I thought is was just a poor retelling of A New Hope.
I thought it was cool to see the old characters older.
I didn't. Harrison Ford looked like he really didn't want to be there. And those aliens they fought when he came up looked fake.
Yeah that was some bad CGI. But the rest of the movie looked good.
I think the New Order or whatever looked way too glossy. The Empire was crushed, now there's a bigger Empire suddenly?
Yeah that was confusing.
There wasn't a sense of setting in it. Just a safe rehash.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Luke will turn into a Sith in the new Star Wars?
I doubt it.
Did you like Episode 7?
It was okay. It was very digital.
I agree. There should have been more puppets.
I did not like the hero either.
Yes. Her character was a bit flat.
You cannot top the original.
True. It is the greatest.
Hopefully the next one is better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched Rogue One?
Yes I have. I have also watched the latest one too, with Rei and Kylo Ren.
Oh yeah, I thought it was a good one, but the guy playing Kylor Ren was not that convincing. Definitely not Darth Vader material.
I thought Rogue one was kinda cool, but not as engaging when you watch it on DVD. Something is missing.
I'm glad at least Donnie Yen is in Rogue one. He is a cool guy and adds depth to the movie.
Yeah like Star Wars isn't only about light saber and laser guns, but can also be about martial arts.
Rogue one i think is a good movie, but maybe because it's trying to jam a lot into a two hour movie, it seems quite complicated.
Yeah while the other Star Wars movie is one of nine and Rogue One is totally entirely a different movie with a different timeline.
Wonder if there will be a Rogue Two or something.
Yeah we'll see that would be awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, I did. I like Star Wars and all, but that one was a lot more intense than the previous ones.
Yeah, I thought so too. It was more like a war movie, but set in the Star Wars universe.
My thoughts exactly. It was still a cool movie though.
Who was your favorite character?
Hmm, that's a tough one. So many good new characters in that movie. I'd have to go with Cassian I guess.
Yeah, he was cool. I liked Jynn the best I think, but K2-SO really stole the show.
Haha, yeah, he was awesome! I liked how blunt he was!
Kinda like C-3PO but with a lot more sass and attitude!
Exactly! Hey, want to rent the DVD this weekend. This conversation makes me want to see it again!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what was your favorite parts about New Hope?
Gosh, so many. Maybe Mos Eisley?
What about the trench run with x-rings.
Yeah that was cool too.
And the parts with sneaking on the death star.
Oh yeah, like when they're saving princess Leia
Yeah and they pretended Chubacca was a prisoner.
Haha yeah, and the trash compactor monster.
Yeah but hey R2D2 saves them.
Haha without C3PO knowing it until a few seconds later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk a bit about some of these intermediary films. Do you think Rogue One was a proper Star Wars film?
I don't know. What do you mean by 'proper'?
I mean is it a respected part of the canon and up to the same quality as the others?
It definitely is. It's politically a very interesting movie.
You mean because of a group of rebels going rogue or radical?
Yes, that's a lot of it. The Rebel Alliance was fairly regressive.
In what respects was it regressive?
Well, they're really only working on behalf of royalty and other regressive political forces.
And Rogue One showed a better way?
It did. It showed that people who really want to get things done don't necessarily listen to the official 'resistance.'
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite type of movie?
I love star wars
Thats a good one
Yes i love it
I enjoy watching it
It yas the right amount of action and romance
They are really exciting
Yes they sre great movies
I cant wait til they come out with another one
Me either
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the new Star Wars movie?
Rogue One or Force Awakens?
Force Awakens - did you like it?  I really liked how it felt like one of the originals.
I really liked that it had the same great characters. I loved seeing Han & Leia and of course, Chewbacca.
I'm excited to see what they will do for the one coming out at the end of the year. I hope they can bring Han back somehow!
I know - I swear I almost cried when he died.  It broke my heart.  I heard someone say that maybe he's the one that turned the light saber on.
Yeah, I heard that theory too.  I think that Kylo Ren is pretty bad though - maybe not evil, but definitely on his way.
Oh yeah, he was crazy - totally off his rocker.  I liked it!
I think that Return of the Jedi is still my favorite.  I just love those ewoks.
Yeah, they're so cute.  Maybe they'll make a return in one of the new movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they'll bring back the Ewoks.
I hope so.
I thought they really made The Return of the Jedi.
They did bring back Widget.
Huh?
In the first prequel, he was in the audience at the pod races.
There weren't any Ewoks!
Not the Ewok, the actor.
Oh!
Bit of trivia for ya.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait to see the next movie!
I know. I'm super excited.
I can't wait to see Luke again.
Yeah, it was such a short glimpse in the first movie.
The training begins!
Maybe....
What do you mean?
His last attempt didn't turn out so well.
"I sense much fear in him."
"Too old to begin the training."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the old Star Wars movies or the new ones
I like the old ones. I grew up with Luke, Hans and Leia.
One of my favorite scenes is when Hans cuts open that animal and stuffs Luke into it to keep them alive.
I thought that was gross.
I also thought it was funny when Leia kissed Luke for luck and Hans got all jealous
Yeah, but then you find out they are brother and sister
Yeah, what a twist. How about Darth Vader being their father
I know right! How messed up is that?
And then later in the series for Han and Leia's son to turn to the dark side
I know, and then he kills Han's!! I almost cried!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the movies from episode I to III is your favorite?
I guess it would have to be Revenge of the Sith.
Oh yeah, that was great as it got to show us how Anakin fell to the Dark Side.
Indeed, Palpatine was such a manipulative influence.
We also got to see how little separates a hero from a villain.
And it really showed us why the Jedi Order wanted to be without emotional attachments.
It can be argued that emotions are a strength, but in this case it was a clear weakness.
For sure, as it was feelings that allowed Anakin to be so thoroughly manipulated.
The best part of the movie for me had to be the fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin.
For me the best part would have to be how Anakin embraced the Dark Side and became a full fledged villain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of the really cool things about Rogue One was seeing Mustafar.
Well, we think it was Mustafar.
It was Mustafar.
It's the only place in the movie that doesn't get a subtitle to tell you where you were.
Right, because you're supposed to recognize it from the end of Episode III.
There could be more than one volcanic planet.
That Darth Vader lives, really?
If it's him, why does he live in the place his life as Anakin ended?
It keeps him in touch with his Fear and Anger, and by extension, the Force.
Huh.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
My all time favorite is Yoda.
Why is Yoda your favorite?
He is so wise and he is little and green!
Yoda is cool, but not as cool as Chewbaca!
What is so great about Chewy?
He is huge and scary but he has a soft side.
It is pretty funny to see him with Han Solo.
Yes they have some interesting conversations.
Yoda is still the best!
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite hero
yoda for sure.
i like obi
they are both so wise.
obi was stronger than annakin
he should have killed him
yeah, and put the saber in his eye.
then vader would never have killed him
but obi did not know what would happen
he thought he would just burn to death
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love star wars
Me too
My friends and i were going to have a star wars weekend
Whats that
Where we hang out and rewatch all the movies
That aounds like fun
It is
I think im going to copy that idea
You will love it
Thanks
XXXXXXXXXXX
what did you think of phantom menace
it wasnt that bad
i feel the exact same way
it was panned only because of jar jar
jar jar was annoying but the rest was fine
darth maul was super cool
anakin and obi were great
the fight scenes were good too
yes they really were
darth maul vs obi
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of the new character Rey?
Shes interesting.  Has a lot of potential.
Agreed.  She seems to have a lot of skill using the force and she hasnt even trained yet.
Heck yeah she did!  Did you see that lightsaber battle?
Um, yeah!  She did pretty well against someone who has been training for years!
True, though that was a little unbelievable.
Yeah, and she seems to be able to use the force against him pretty well too.
Again, a little unbelievable.
Well hopefully the explain this in the next movie.
They better!  I want to know whats going to happen!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, have seen Rogue One?
No, I;'ve had a chance. Is it any good?
Yeah, it's very good, it tells the story of how the Death Star Plans were captured.
Really, that's sound interesting. Any cameo's from the main trilogies or other works?
Jimmy Smits plays Bail Organa, Artoo and C3PO have a quick cameo, and Grand Moff Tarkin plays a sizable role.
Grand Moff Tarkin, how'd they do that.
They used green screen and CGI techniques to superimpose Peter Cushings face onto another actor, and that actor sounded pretty close to Cushings voice as well.
Man, it amazing what they can do with CGI these days.
Yeah, they even used the same technique to have Princess Leia have a quick cameo near the end of the film.
Whoa, now I definitely will make time to see Rogue One.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Special Editions or the originals. Which do you prefer?
Have to be the special editions.
What? Why?
I like how updated all the effects are and all the extra creatures on Tatooine.
Yeah, but Han didn't shoot second.
George Lucas said he was supposed to
There's no way Han was intended to shoot second. That was a cold blooded killing.
It COULD have been self defense.
Okay, fine. It was a cold blooded killing as self defense.
Wait, what?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who my favorite character is in Star Wars?
I don't know, Luke?
No, Vader is my favorite.
Why is that?
Well he's kind of like a cyborg for starters and his voice sounds scary and intimidating.
That's a good point I never liked him though.
He's also not scared to use his powers for what he believes in.
Do you like villain characters more than the good guys?
Not really but Vader does end up having a very good ending to his story in my opinion.
I agree that moment when he took his mask off and the following minute or two were epic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into Star Wars ?
No I was when I was a kid when the original came out  but i didnt do the new ones
LOL do yo even remember the title that far  back ??
Yes I do it was The Empire Strikes Back  it was even our 5th grade play
oh wow haha  who did you play ?
R2 D2  . I did the squeak and shuffle and everything
Wow I wish video of that still existed
Did you have a favorite from back then ?
I liked Yoda  . I still like seeing him come on memes on facebook
Yoda knows  all  !!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been watching Chasing Amy too much. I can't get the Star Wars scene out of my mind.
Ha.  Darth Vader, Nubian God.
Obviously, that makes Luke mixed race.
It would have been cool if they had James Earl Jones in that armor.
Oh, yes.  Certainly.
We wouldn't have had to endure Hayden Christensen's acting, either.
Don't knock Hayden.  He's done some good work.  I just don't think he was ready for something like Star Wars.  And I think Lucas's directing wasn't the best.
Lucas should have gotten Spielberg to do it.
He tried, from what I understand. Spielberg convinced him to do it.
That was a mistake.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Star Wars franchise. Do you?
Oh yes I absolutely love the Star Wars movies.
They are just the greatest, aren't they?
Totally agreed.
Which actor do you like best?
I love Carrie Fisher in the movie.
But she was not that major though.
Are you kidding?
She was not in my opinion compared to Harrison Ford and Marc Hamil.
That is somewhat true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard somewhere that someone died on the set of the new Star Wars movie?
What?  That didn't happen.
I thought I heard it somewhere.
I think you're obviously mistaken.
Oh, I know what it was.  It was actually Harrison Ford dying on the set.
You mean his character Han Solo in the last film.
Yeah.  Guess I got confused.
You guess?  You were way off.
Well, so many people die in these films it's hard to keep track.
It's not that hard!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think Luke's been doing on a deserted island for all those years?
I would think trying to find something to eat.
He had to have learned from Yoda how to keep his mind busy.
I bet he spent time standing by the shore seeing how far he could skip rocks with his mind.
Why do you keep coming up with weird thoughts?
I don't know, he was on an island with nobody and nothing around, there's only so much he can do.
I bet he thought a lot about his dad.
You mean Darth?
Luuuuuke, I am your father.
He doesn't even say that line!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Are you familiar with star wars?
Yeah I've seen a few of the newer movies.
Have seen any of the original?
No, I have seen the ones with ewan mcregor in them.
Oh the prequels.
Yeah I guess.
Did you like those?
They were just okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which movie is your favorite out of the Star Wars original trilogy?
I definitely love Return of the Jedi the most out of the three!
Why do you like Return of the Jedi more than the other two movies?
It is because it is the final showdown between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader/Sith Lord.
I think the final fight scene between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader/Sith Lord was awesome!
So do I! The special effects back then were amazing!
The Sith Lord's lightning powers were very cool to look at.
I especially love when the Sith Lord was thrown over the railing.
I was shocked that happened because I thought it would be Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader to die.
So was I, I had to watch that scene a couple more times.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the most attractive woman character in the Star Wars movies?
Well, back in the original trilogy it would have easily been Princess Leia?
Now, something is different?
Well I think Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala has her bested.
Oh, you do not think it is just because it is newer?
It is kind of hard to tell I guess.
Yes, everybody in 1970s TV now doesn't look as attractive.
It is the hair the clothing, maybe just the film definition is not as good.
You did not like Rey in The Force Awakens?
Yes, she is cute too but not like Senator Amidala.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, I think I'm starting to come around to the star wars prequels.
I don't even know you anymore. What changed your mind?
I think its been long enough, I just see them in a new light, you know?
Have you even seen episode 3? You are crazy.
I think I even like Jar Jar Binks more than when I first saw him.
Now I know you're going crazy.
Hes no worse than a Rob Schneider character.
Thats not saying much.
Meesa not apologzing for my tastes.
You are ridiculous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When does Star Wars take place?
A long time ago.
Were does it take place?
Somewhere far, far away
Isn't that the opening line?
Yes
Stop! I am serious.
I am too. I'm giving you correct information
Okay. I thought maybe it took place in the Andromeda galaxy
No. That doesn't seem far enough away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the trailer for the" Star Wars 8" movie that is coming out soon.
Did it look like a good episode?
Yeah, I cannot wait till it comes out in theaters, Luke Skywalker is going to be in it.
I hope Yoda will be in that episode, that would be cool.
Yeah! Yoda can fight, he fought Darth Sidious.
Darth Sidious cannot beat Yoda.
Yeah! just like when "Anakin  and Obi-Wan fought.
I like the first episode when Luke Skywalker join forces with Jedi knights.
Yeah, I do too, in the movie "Return of the Jedi, Obi-Wan almost dies.
I know, I like Obi-Wan he is a great fighter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars Movies?
Yeah‚ I enjoy them but I'm not a superfan or anything
Yeah‚ I know what you mean
Some people are just fanatical about them
Do you prefer the original ones‚ the last lot or the current ones.
I enjoy them all really‚ no real preference for either series.
Do you prefer one side over the other‚ are you a fan of the Empire or the Rebels?
I'm pro-rebel all the way‚ the Empire is evil!
Would you ever dress up as a character from one of the movies?
Oh hell no‚ that is not my thing at all
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the deal with midiclorians, or whatever they're called?
I'm not sure. I thought that was a pretty weird explination.
Why did they even need to explain?
Guess it just put some "science" behind it.
Rather odd though....
How else would they test Anikan?
Fair enough, but I think they could have come up with something better.
Been no mention of it in the new one.
True. Hopefully it remains that way.
You said it, brother!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character from Star Wars?
Princess Leia, she is so awesome.
I like Leia too.  She is a strong role model for girls.
So is Rey.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
I know right, do you think that she's the "Last Jedi"
I don't know, maybe it's Luke.
He was so cool in the Force Awakens.
I know I got chills!
I wish that they hadn't killed off Han.
I know that just broke my heart,
XXXXXXXXXXX
Here's a fun fact. Star Wars Episode I was the only prequel film to be shot on actual celluloid film.
Why is that?
Well, George Lucas switched to digital film-making after The Phantom Menace.
Oh, that reminds me, didn't they go back to film with Episode VII?
Yeah, The Force Awakens was made on film. Not that it really matters.
Why doesn't it?
Because, it was filmed on film, but then the CGI and other digital effects were put in digitally.
Oh, I didn't even think of that.
The final product is digital too, as all films are nowadays. So it really made no difference to film on celluloid to start with.
I guess they did it so they could say it wasn't digital like the prequels, even if it really was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In the Force Awakens movie, Rey seems to have such a strong natural connection to the Force. Why do you think that is?
It's a big mystery so far. Do you have any theories?
I think she might be related to any of the Jedi's from the previous movies. They were hunted to extinction but there still might be some people who are force sensitive.
But her sensitivity seems stronger than most. There must be some special reason behind that.
With what has been revealed to us regarding the Force, there doesn't really have to be. Maybe they will link her to someone of importance.
Who do you think she could be linked to?
There are all kinds of theories. Some will insist that she is related to Obi-Wan, but it just doesn't add up with the timeline.
Why do you think she can hear voices when she was near Luke's lightsaber?
I would attribute that to her Force sensitivity and the Force spirits having had some kind of connection with Luke.
That's a possibility, I guess we will get to know more in the upcoming movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did the very first Star Wars movie come out?
Well, you know that the very first one was actually episode 4, don't you?
Oh yeah!  I had forgotten about that.  It was the middle trilogy.
Yes--and to answer your question, it came out in 1977.
Did you see it in the theater?
Yes, I did.  It was an amazing experience!
Who was your favorite character from the first set of movies?
Luke Skywalker, of course.
I guess he was kind of the underdog that came into his own by the end of the movie.
Yes, he really ended up saving the day at the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?
I saw it when it came out in theaters.
Who was your favorite character?
I liked K-2SO best!
I thought he was great, especially since Alan Tudyk was his voice actor.
Do you think he is going to be in more Star Wars movies?
I don't think he would fit in the sequel to The Force Awakens since it is so far in the future.
The Force Awakens has BB-8 though, and he is an awesome little droid.
I loved when BB-8 got away with the map, like R2-D2 escaping with Leia's recording in A New Hope.
That was a great throwback to the first movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait until the next Star Wars that comes out in December.
Yes me too I can't wait to see how the story continues.
I wounder what they will do with Carrie Fishers part.
They will probably digitally alter the scenes.
I think that would work.
The movie is centered around Leia as she is at the end with C3PO and R2D2
That left you hanging for sure.
The part that I am most excited is about Mark Hamill.
Yes, Luke will play an important part in the next movie.
I thing it will have an impact on Rey's character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you going to see the new star wars movie, the last jedi?
DUDE the trailer looks amazing!
I know right! What you think of luke skywalker in it
I like the beard on him, gives him an obie wan feel
Who you think snoke is?
Hmmm not sure
I think he's plagues or his master
Oooo Nice idea!
Or maybe another guy?
Not sure, I'm excited to find out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy the new star wars at all?
The force awakens?
Yeah.
Not really actually.
Seriously?
Yeah I think it was much over hyped. I liked seeing harrison ford and carrie fisher but not the new people.
Yeah I get that. When you are so used to the old characters, new ones seem weird.
Plus it was by Disney this time. I did not like it.
Well it was nice speaking to you.
You too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited about the new force awakens movies?
Well, I am glad they finally came away from all of that nonsense Episode 1, 2 & 3.
What do you mean? It was great to see the back story of Darth Vader and Obi Wan having the lead.
Anakin, aka young Vader was so dreadful to watch, not to mention even Samuel Jackson's part couldnt liven things up much.
I see what you mean. I am excited about the new characters. It is great to see Chewbacca return, and BB-8 is so lovable.
I do like seeing the old school movies mixed with the new story line. Po and Fin are both entertaining characters to watch.
I like what they have done with all of the storm troopers, too. They aren't just one kind, like in attack of the clones.
Yes, the storm troopers have all kinds of different weapons and obvious ranks, it makes the fight scenes that much more intriguing.
I can't wait to see who the new ultimate bad guy is. I think Snoke may be his name.
Oh yes, he sounds like a good nemesis. Hopefully he is very powerful and gets a good story line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Episode six is the best Star Wars.
Really? I think Episode five is the best.
I just really like that final meeting between Luke and Vader.
Yeah that is good, but I think the famous reveal in Episode five is better.
Oh thats definitely a great scene, hard to choose between the two honestly.
Yeah but its a lot easier to compare the new trilogy don't you think?
Oh for sure, obviously Episode Three is the best of the prequels.
Yeah agree with that, best lightsaber battles of all the Star Wars movies probably.
No question, the end fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin is classic.
Yeah That might be my overall favorite Star Wars fight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you believe that Han Solo shot first?
When I saw A New Hope before it's remaster, I think I remember that Greedo shot first.
Me too, I can't believe they edited it like that!
I know, I think it's a dishonor to Han Solo's character.
I don't think Han Solo would of killed someone first.
Yeah, in my opinion it was self-defense.
I am just glad that Han Solo didn't get hit with the bullet lazer.
Me too, otherwise the movies would of turned out differently.
I can't even imagine Star Wars without Han Solo.
Me either!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite Star Wars movie was Return of the Jedi, which one is your favorite?
My favorite Star Wars movie was A new hope.
I like when the movies use the old characters-Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, etc.
I find some of the saga hard to follow.
The ewoks in Return of the Jedi are so cute and cuddly.
It was sad when some of the ewoks died.
Jabba the Hutt is funny and gross at the same time.
Princess Leia was not afraid of him at all.
In the new hope, the attack on the empire's death star was very exciting.
Yes, I was on the edge of my seat during that part of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Gungans?
They were mean to Jar Jar
He didn't do anything to deserve the way they treated him
He was made a general, but only after they treated him so badly
He was a funny guy
The head Gungan talked funny
We don't know exactly what Jar Jar did. The Gungans were made out to be sub human.
It was barbaric the way that they poked Jar Jar with the stick.
Their weapons were behind the times
Jar Jar was the best of them, even though his people treated him badly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember in Empire Strikes Back there was that scene with all the bounty hunters
Right, Vader recruited them to catch Han Solo
There was like a robot one, an alien one, some guy wrapped up like a mummy
And of course Bubba Fett
Yes, Bubba Fett. He was a great character.
I wonder why Vader needed bounty hunters to catch Han Solo
True, I thought he had the force.
Must not have worked with Han Solo.
In the end Bubba Fett caught them though, right.
Yeah, he was the one that finally got them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When the next star wars movie comes out, are you going to see it?
Perhaps. I do not know yet.
We should see it together.
Okay that sounds fun.
Which star wars is your favorite?
I like the sixth one.
Who is your favorite in that?
I like Jabba.
He is funny but creepy at the same time.
I agree he is a weird creature.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which character in the franchise do you think had the best story arc?
Darth Vader, by far. He just had such a long journey, especially once the prequels came out.
I completely agree. You found yourself wondering towards Empire if this was any hope for him at all.
Definitely. But I think once it's revealed that he is Luke's father, it becomes a bit more apparent.
That is interesting. How did you figure at that point?
Because Luke, who is completely fighting the good fight, now knows his father was not murdered, and is indeed Darth Vader. You can't help but feel that Luke will try to help him "heal", so to speak.
Makes total sense. And of course, you do know "Return of the Jedi" is named after Vader, right?
Of course. At the very end, where he saves Luke from the Emperor.
Yes. Vader became Anakin Skywalker and a Jedi, once again.
By sacrificing himself for his son, he didn't die just a Jedi, but a hero.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's happening in the Star Wars universe right now?
Well, the original Star Wars story has already passed with the Skywalkers and Darth Vader, and the next generation is being followed.
Who are the next generation of jedis?
Well funny you say that. There are actually no more jedi's. And the new movies are new jedis.
Oh! Return of the Jedi!
Yeah exactly. The new heroine is Reya.
That's a pretty cool name. Is she strong?
Yeah, she found out she had Jedi powers in the first movie.
Does she use her powers for good?
I don't know... You'll have to watch the movie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how Star Wars changed the toy industry?
They increased the sales of figure toys?
Not exactly. They promoted the idea of a female character action figure, which had always been lacking before.
Do you mean Princess Leia?
No, Rey from The Force Awakens. Before her, there were rarely female action figures, because they just didn't sell well.
And Rey was so popular it changed the demand?
Yes. People had complained before about not being able to find female character figures, and even leading up to the movie there was no Rey. But after the movie came out, she was on everything, and outsold everyone except the villian character.
I bet the times had a lot to do with the change. Girls and women are no longer shy about standing up and complaining through social media about unfair treatment.
Now thanks to Rey, toy stores have all kinds of female action figures, like Wonder Woman and Batgirl.
Kids have started to break molds now too about what they should be interested in playing with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you know, Greedo shot first.
Um, says you?
Come on.
No really. The original Star Wars trilogy, without the new special edition, is what counts. And Han Solo clearly shot first
The THX remastered version?
Yes, that is the definitive account of Star Wars. Nothing else matters. No CGI'd aliens, not Jar Jar Binks, none of it.
OK, but doesn't that make Han kind of a scoundrel?`
Of course it does. That's what Han is. That's why it's significant that he later finds the good inside and helps the rebellion.
Man, you really take this stuff seriously.
What can I say? I'm a Star Wars purist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish it would come sooner
What would
The next episode
Why
Because i am so impatient
Gotta learn to wait
But i just want to know what happens next
You will
Not soon though
Yes but eventually
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe how long Star Wars has existed?
I'm actually not a fan, so I really don't know much about it.
Are you serious? It's one of the most storied film franchises in history!
I know it has status, but it's just not for me. Anyways, how long's it been around?
Well, the first film came out in 1977.
40 years? Really?
It's crazy, isn't it?
It's insane that a franchise could have such longevity.
It's even more impressive that they're still pumping out quality movies.
Wow. That's unbelievable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Star Wars was ahead of it's time for having such a strong Female protagonist?
I think Leia was strong and independent at first, but they kind of ruined it by having her fall in love.
But that makes it stronger. She is a strong woman, but still a woman with a heart and emotions.
She kissed her brother.
She didn't know he was her brother and she only did it to make Han jealous.
That's gotta be awkward though, every fight has to end with 'at least I didn't kiss my brother'.
It does beg the question of why they split up.
There's obviously still feelings there.
She was royalty and he was a criminal, it was never going to work.
Can you still be royalty if you got your own planet blown up?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the last Star Wars movie to come out?
Rouge One (A new hope)
Yeah.  I liked that one.  Did you?
Yes, but it was really sad.
Ha!  Yes, you can't get attached to any of the characters.  I do mean, you can't get attached to any of the characters!
Yeah.  That was rough.  How many movies have you seen when pretty much all of the characters die?
Not many.  I have to say, that was very unique for a Star Wars movie.  It's one of the few that I actually did like.
Wait, what?  You didn't like the other Star Wars movies?
No.  I think they are just overblown.  Lucas stole most of that from Joseph Campbell.  It's just "Hero with 1000 Faces" all over again.
well, I guess it has mainstreamed.  EVERYONE likes it now, and Disney is a freakin' evil marketing machine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the prequel trilogy?
No, and I don't know anyone who did.
They really messed up the plotlines in that movie.
I agree. Did we really need to see Darth Vader as a whining teenager?
And Padme's character was so flat and uninteresting.
She just seemed bored to me, like she didn't want to be there.
Palpatine was cool, though.
Yeah, he was the only one that seemed to enjoy what he was doing.
Why were the Jedi so foolish in that movie?
They were complacent, I guess, but they just came off as blind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Name your favorite Jedi.
From Star Wars?
Yes of course.
Luke Skywalker?
Everyone picks him.  Anyone else?
Sorry that's all I know.
It's okay.
okay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, Rogue One is such a messy Star Wars film.
In a good way though, right?
I don't know. It just feels disjointed.
What's disjointed about it?
For example, they spend most of the first act looking for Saw Gerrera, and then he tells Jyn her dad is alive, and dies.
So? He provided useful information?
Information which the characters already knew. He doesn't do much at all, besides eat up time.
But he also tortures the Imperial pilot guy. So there's that.
Yeah, and the pilot gets better immediately. Nothing seems to much matter until they decide to go to Scarif to steal the Death Star plans near the end of the movie.
I suppose the movie may have benefited from a little extra time in the writer's room, maybe.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of Kylo Ren?
He's a pretty sinister character, and a look-alike of Darth Vader.
But obviously, he seems weaker right?
Yeah, in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, he didn't even seem that powerful.
But he's got a bad-ass looking lightsaber, tho.
YEAHHH!!! His lightsaber was actually an idea of a close friend of mine!!
Could you spare me the details?
No can do! Don't wanna mention anymore Star Wars spoilers from here!
Come to think of it, I haven't seen the Rogue One movie yet.
It's not that great, honestly, I'll tell you that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite character on Star Wars?
I really like Master Yoda.
Yeah, he was awesome.  So small but powerful.
And Frank Oz was brilliant as Yoda.
He was.  He speaks a little odd though.
Yeah, so wise but can't seem to put a sentence together.
I loved his fight scenes though.
Yeah, right before he came in I was just thinking how awesome Yoda might be.
We were not disappointed either.
Nope, he's a stud with a light saber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the better villian, Darth Vader or Kylo Ren?
Oh, Darth Vader.  Can't even compare yet. 6 movies versus 1.
True, but I think he has potential.
He did kill his father.
But, I didn't like him being all emotional.
Well, it's a bit more realistic.
I guess. I hope that he isn't that one girl's brother.
No, I think she's his cousin.
I hope Rey is related to Obi-Wan instead of Luke and Leia.
I like that idea!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think that the Star Wars movies were such a success?
I think that it was the mythos that Lucas created: sword and sorcery among the stars -- it was a mash-up of old Hollywood tropes.
I could see that.  The Force -- everyone imagined how that might be useful: mysterious, powerful and ubiquitous.
Also, there was a slowly unfolding story beneath the movies, as they went along: Luke finds his history *and* his destiny!
I know -- *everyone* was shocked along with Luke when Darth Vader said "Luke -- I am your father!" in The Empire Strikes Back!
And then -- with the second trio of movies -- we came to find out that this was all *really* Anakin Skywalker's story.
But now there's a deeper mystery -- we now know who Kylo Ren's parents were -- but what of Rey? How does she fit in?
And, of course, in every movie, we find out a little more about the Jedi and the Sith and -- of course -- the mysterious Force!
It's amazing that George Lucas has managed to create this entire mythos -- this entire Universe! -- and we just can't get enough of it.
I can't wait to see what surprising twist that The Last Jedi has in mind for us!
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about the force awakens
honestly, it was okay
a lot of people seemed to love it. i guess you dont.
that is true. it was kinda boring.
did you like kylo ren at least?
he is nothing like the force that was vader.
he did not do it for you, huh?
he was just an immature child with power.
yeah, but that makes him interesting.
not to me
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, I caught that a few weeks ago!  Got it from the local library.
Cool, what did you think?
Well, I thought it wasn't too bad... had a lot of good action scenes.
Yeah, I thought so to, but I do think they could have developed the characters a bit more.
Yeah, that one girl, for instance uh.. shoot.. Jin?
Jyn, her name was Jyn Erso.  She was played by Felicity Jones
Yeah, I wish they had delved more into her background and given her a bit more personality.
Yeah, I agree with that.  But you gotta admit, the Darth Vader was pretty awesome!
It was, although you do wonder why he didn't use any of those "slam people into walls/ceiling" tactics in the other films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen Star Wars right?
Yes I have.
Do you like Obi-Won?
Yes but he's too trusting.
Is that a bad thing?
It was when he trusted Luke too much it almost got him killed and so many others.
Luke made his choices.
Yes but they could have been prevented sooner.
I don't think so.
Obi could have seen it coming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know who Irvin Kershner is?
I havent heard of him
He directed the Empire Strikes Back.
Oh ok thats cool
Yeah he was probably the best director  they had
Thats pretty cool.
He also directed other movies.
I wish he would have done Return of the Jedi.
You dont like the way that movie was directed?
I think it could have had improvements
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
Good question, I would have to say return of the Jedi. What about you?
I would have to agree, return if the Jedi had a little bit of everything.
Yes it did, the original three were the best storie lines, although the recent ones have been very good also.
Yes, the force awakens blew me away, it was s good. Apart from the fact Han Solo dies.
I was suprised by that too. He was always one of my favorite characters.
I have a feeling he will come back somehow.
That’s hopeful, but I could see it happening. They are trying to be original with the new movies.
Yes, like them both dieting at the end of rogue one.
I was suprised by that, I read the book so I knew it was going to happen but I hoped that they would change it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some favorite scenes you like?
I like that scene were Luke is driving across the desert in a landspeeder. Beautiful scenary.
Yes, it was beautiful. It felt like this was going to be a adventure.
Another scene I liked was when they discovered  Princess Leiah`s hologram in R2D2.
Yes that set up the plot that there was going to be a special mission.
What did you think of the villian Darth Vader`s scene when he fought Obi Wan Kenobi?
To me this was the most saddest scene in the movie because Vader it seemed killed Ben.
Yeah, I think that was the saddest scene in the movie.
The Best most satisyfying scene in the movie to me is when the DeathStar blew up.
Yes,totally because that ment the good guys one. What a good way to finish the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey i got a question for you
Sure you can ask anything you want
Sure ok well first do you know some about star wars?
Well yes i do who does not
Well that is true
So what is the question
Is The Force Awakens just a retread
I think it is it follows similar story beats
Exactly some guy on reddit is disagreeing with me
He is pretty wrong
XXXXXXXXXXX
This movie is awesome
What movie is awesome
The new star wars
Which new one
Their was more than one
Well yeah their were two
What  how did i not know this
I am not sure but yeah their has for awhile
Well now i am ecstatic
Wanna come by and watch them?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like Return of the Jedi was the best film in the series.
I cant say that is true.
Why not?
I thought it had too haphazard of a story line.
How so?
Luke's character seemed stale.
So you think Mark Hamill underperformed?
I wouldnt say that completely.
You said it was stale
I think there could have been better writing thats all
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
You into star wars?
yeah of course!
Cool same here.
What is your favorite movie?
I like Empire Strikes Back.
That's a classic.
Yeah I love it.  What about you?
I like Return of the Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could be one character from star wars movies , who would it be?
Since I am female  I would have to say lea.
Really why? The new females are so much more empowered.
Well I loved the original star wars movies the most. I also love that gold bikini and adore Han solo.
Fair enough reasons. The other newer females don't really have any love interest do they?
Well with rae she sort of does, but not as clear if that will develop or not. But not as overt.
That is true, I was just thinking we left out the whole romance of queen amidala.
Oh yes, I did blank on that. She was not as fun or witty but did have beautiful costumes.
I agree. Much stiffer character than lea. But great costume design.
I forgot to ask your favorite star wars  movie character, sorry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello
Hey man
What are you up to
I am actually rewatching some stuff
What are you rewatching
I am watching star wars episode 1
ouch sorry for you then
It is not that bad i like it
I mean it is kinda cheesy
It definitely is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars
Yes, do you
Of course they are amazing
I love the story line to them
I hate how they dont follow the books though
Yea me too
I wish they would have a little more
I agree
Ut they are still really good
Definitely
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Idk, what's yours?
I asked you first!
So?
Okay, I like Luke Skywalker
He's the one that is the giant slug like guy, right?
No, thats not him
Who is he then
He's the one that has the longer 70's hair, in white, blue lightsaber, on the side of good...
oh oh okay!
XXXXXXXXXXX
what was your favorite star wars battle?
definitely not obi vs vader
that was so stupid and short.
anakin vs obi was so much better.
vader just killed obi with hardly any effort.
obi was too old at that point.
say that to yoda.
yoda isnt a human being though.
yoda is a god.
probably not that though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi there.
Do you like Star Wars?
Sure.
Do you have a favorite movie?
I really like the most recent one that came out.
Rogue One?
Yeah that's the one.
Really enjoyed that one as well.
It was great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Rogue One?
I was a little disappointed.
What disappointed you?
It was a little dull for me.
Wow. I thought it was action packed.
They spend most of the movie planning.
I guess it does take a while for the action to get going.
I also didn't care for the way they put Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin in with digital effects.
That wasy weird but the Dark Vader scene.
OK, he totally kicked butt in that one scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Yoda from the movie EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.
Yoda was funny with that Grover voice.
And the way he talked.
Yes. He would say things a lot different.
He reminds me of like an old wise man.
I think Yoda was like 700 years old or something.
He looked old but used his light saber in that other movie.
He was really short.
Yeah, and he had the wobble when he walked.
I miss Yoda.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch Rogue one?
Yes i watched Rogue one. the movie was awesome. The whole series seems so much better that they are making filler movies such as rogue one.
Yes i have to agree, now we know the whole story of how the rebels got the coordinates for the death star.
Yeah not bad and Felicty Jones did a great job with her role as Jyn Esro.
I have to disagree i think the best acting in rogue one was by Diego Luna who played the role of Captain Cassian. He was the real rebel he was bad ass in my opinion.
Yeah but i still like Felicity Jones but i know what you mean by when Diego Luna did a good job. Especially when he killed of his own informant to get out of trouble, thats a real rebel move.
Haha I guess, what do you think of the new Star movies movie that is coming out this December.
I am definetly excited but i do not like the name.
Really you dont like the name The Last Jedi?
Yeah i feel like they are changing up the story too much. I also didnt like the fact that they killed off Han Solo in Force Awakens.
XXXXXXXXXXX
OK, I just don't get this.  If Yoda is in tune with the Force and can see the future, why does he not see that Anakin Skywalker is working for the Smith Lord?
He says in Phantom Menace that his future is clouded.
That still doesn't add up.  I'll grant you that he can't see Anakin's future, but he also can't see the future of the hundreds of other people that Anakin kills?
The dark side hides things from him.
That still doesn't make sense. The guy kills all the Jedi trainees, Chancellor Palpatine has clone warriors kill hundreds of Jedis and Yoda has no idea it's coming?
I told you, the dark side clouds his vision.  He can no longer get a clear vision of what is going to happen.
I still think it's really irresponsible of him.  He should have warned all those people, they all died because he didn't see these things coming.
What was he supposed to do?  Say "Hey I have a bad feeling about all this? Be extra careful?"  That's too vague, it wouldn't have done any good.
Look, I'm just saying it's very convenient that a guy who can see the future can't see anything about these cataclysmic events that end up changing and entire galaxy.
I guess you're right, that is a huge hole in the plot that takes up an entire movie franchise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favourite aspect of the Star Wars franchise?
I would have to say the special effects.
Really? Considering how bad they were back then?
Yeah they were bad but there's something homey about movies from that time.
I don't know, for me it's kind of distracting. I like a more streamlined look.
There's something to be said for the improvement in special effects, but I like the fact that back then you had to settle for something obviously bad, that people couldn't have every snazzy thing they wanted.
You actually like not being satisfied?
On the contrary, I'm completely satisfied with them. The difference was you had less available to be satisfied with and you just had to be content with it.
I think I understand that.
It's just my two cents anyway.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was up with Jar Jar Binks?
It was a marketing ploy to sell toys to kids
but how did he fit into the movie?
It introduces the audience to the gungand
who were they
they were living on a planet that the trade federation wanted to take over
who is the trade federation?
the bad guys
Bad guys?
You're supposed to care about them but you don't I like the other Gungans better
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who are some of your favorite minor characters in the Star Wars films?
You mean, those kind of walk-on, wordless cameo aliens? I have a couple.
Yeah, like the guys they made action figures of but aren't really onscreen for very long.
Well, I've always been fascinated by the other bounty hunters in the lineup with Boba Fett.
You mean, at Cloud City?
Totally! I mean, we have Dengar, who is this kind of dirty, grizzled looking guy covered in bandages, with maybe mechanical limbs...
Oh yeah, and 4-LOM, who looks sort of like an evil insectoid C-3PO.
Yeah, it's such a great visual.
And Bossk, the kind of reptilian fellow in a spacesuit, who looks nasty and ravenous.
Yes! It's like, they're only onscreen for a few seconds but you want to know more about them all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Rogue One was a great example of taking an obscure but vital reference in A New Hope and turning it into a dynamite action film.
I disagree. I think in filming Rogue One they were straining for plot ideas.
But just think of it: it's the archetypical story of a group of misfits who sacrifice themselves for high ideals.
I have to admit that you're right about that. And Jyn certainly makes a compelling character.
Of course. She's the classic hero figure who finds her calling and sacrifices everything else to fulfil it.
Maybe, but I don't like the ending. It's too harsh; Everyone gets killed.
They make the ultimate sacrifice. What's wrong with that? And isn't it awesome at the end that the story ties in to giving the Deathstar plans to Princess Lia?
Yes, it was nice to tie it in to A New Hope in that way. But the way they used CGI to simulate Carrie Fisher didn't work well.
I know. For me too that kind of spoiled that final scene. But I have to look at it in perspective. They did the best they could.
Maybe they did. At least it did successfully link this movie to the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the news about the Han Solo movie?
There's a Han Solo movie?
I... well, uh. Not yet.
Oh Lord. Disney is really milking this, huh.
I dunno, maybe. But it looks like it's... in trouble, anyway.
Oh no. A spin-off movie nobody asked for is in trouble.
I mean. It... could be kind of cool. We don't know anything about his early life.
Isn't that kind of the point of him? Why do we need to know any of that?
Because... he's Han Solo. I mean, he's the best one.
I'm assuming Harrison Ford isn't in this, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so glad we're doing a Star Wars movie night!
I am too. Are we just starting from the beginning?
I've never just watched them all the way through. I thought Phantom Menace would be a good place to start.
It's not my favorite, but I think it could be fun.
Why not?
I just never cared for Jar-jar.
Well, you can go get us snacks during those parts!
That's true. What's a good snack to eat while watching Star Wars.
Popcorn, obviously.
You set up the movie, and I'll go pop some!
XXXXXXXXXXX
People say Star Wars was all made up as it went, and it kind of was, but a lot of things were actually planned way ahead of time.
Like what? Darth Vader was always Luke's father?
No, that definitely only came about during the writing of Empire Strikes Back.
But you do have some examples, otherwise you wouldn't bring it up.
Of course. For example, during the making of the first film, George Lucas had the idea that the stormtroopers were all clones.
But they aren't though. I guess not until the prequels anyway.
Well, at the time, in '70s, it was just impractical to do that. But by the 2000s technology advanced, and he had a bigger budget, so his idea of a clone army came to fruition.
Kind of funny then, considering that in canon the clones were replaced by recruits eventually.
Another thing, Anakin getting fried on a volcano planet and becoming Darth Vader was something that dates back to around Empire or Jedi, too.
I'm sure a lot of it was still made up way later, but I see what you're saying. Some of the ideas that were used are pretty old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Looking  back  what do  you think of the  clone wars movie ?
I liked  parts of it  and it  sure was action packed .
I really liked  Jackson playing  a  jedi .
It was a  shame that  fett  killed his  character .
I  kept  hoping he would  show back up  in  flash backs .
Well maybe in  another  movie  .
Its  cool  how  yoda  always shows up in  these movies
Well  he is the master .
I would  still like to  see  a  stand  alone  movie  with a  young  yoda .
Maybe  showing  how  he  finds the  force
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Star Wars Franchise as a whole?
Well I enjoyed it but I enjoyed The Force Awakens the most.
Why is that?
Well it introduced us to a whole new set of people.
I take it you liked them quite a bit?
I enjoyed Rey and Kylo's stories the most.
They did do a good job with them.
I enjoyed how there true characters were forced out at the end of the movie when they had to battle.
I think Rey's character will change quite a bit over the next movies.
Yeah it should be interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched all the Star Wars movies yet?
No, wow you're asking a lot. There are so many.
How far did you get in the series?
I only got to the fourth movie, The Phantom Menace.
That was a great movie.
Yes, it was. Are all the movies over two hours long?
Most of them, yes. Except I think The Clone Wars.
Who was your favorite character from all the movies combined?
Well Darthy Vader of course. Who was yours?
Hans Solo, But also like CP3O.
XXXXXXXXXXX
George Lucas did a really great job with the first star wars movie
He really did, I love return of the Jedi
What about that christmas t.v. special?
Oh that was terrible.
Chewbacca was funny though
I suppose. the whole thing felt like a fever dream.
So the new movie is called The Last Jedi?
Yes. And the next one comes out in 2019.
What is it called?
Star Wars episode IX
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
Yes, of course!
What was your favorite movie?
I have to say the first one!
As in A New Hope or as in The Phantom Menace?
A New Hope of course! I wasn't really a fan of episodes 1-3.
Yeah me neither.
What about you? What was your favorite.
I really liked the most recent one, The Force Awakens!
Me too, it was really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite movie?
I love STAR WARS the original from 1977.
Cool. Me too.
Who is your favorite character?
I like Luke.
Luke is cool
I liked his robot R2D2.
I like C3-PO.
Darth Vader scared me.
Yeah, his breathing was freaky.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the "new" Star Wars movies?
I have, but I don't think that they are half as good as the original trilogy.
I mean, I can see where you are coming from, but I think they are pretty good.
Jar-Jar Binks is the most annoying character there has ever been.
Well, true. I really like Darth Maul as a villian though.
Oh definitely, I just wish they had done more with his storyline. It was so short.
Yeah, I know. I think the last two movies that have been put out have been better than there first attempts at reviving it.
I will say that they have improved. I like how Luke Skywalker is back into the plotline here recently.
I think that it helps bring the movies together more. I really liked Han Solo and the Millenium Falcon being back.
The Millenium Falcon is still the coolest ship in the Star Wars Universe, in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know the Emperor from the original movies is the same as the ones from the prequels.
Well of course he's the same character!
And the same actor.
No way!
Yup.
Well, isn't that funny.
The young Emperor is actually the older emperor.
Too hillarious! I thought they picked a good guy for the prequels.
They picked the ONLY guy!
I'll have to remember that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what's your favorite original trilogy star wars movie?
I think I liked Empire Strikes back the most
Any particular reason?
I think because it had a dark tone and a non happy ending.
Yeah it seems more realistic that way.
I also like the classic scenes of the snow speeder battle and AT ATs.
Also who could forget about Darth Vader being Luke's father?
Yeah that was one of the biggest surprises of the decade.
Yeah; I also liked the scenes in Cloud City.
You forgot about Dagobah and Yoda!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I still think Rogue one was better
Better than what
The original ones
Do you mean 1-3 or 4-6
What do you think
1-3?
No 4-6
Nah it is good but not as good
Well i disagree
Why though
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like how C3PO was used in Star Wars?
Sure I mean he was a side piece.
But dont you think he deserved more attention
Like his own spin off?
Yeah because of his characterization
No I think that would have not been believable.
I think things would have tidied up nicely with him at the helm.
So at the beginning of Empire Strikes back you wanted him to hit someone?
I didnt say he had to be violent.
Well I dont know what you would have him do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Fan of Star Wars?
Yeah who isn't?
What character do you like the most in the films?
I really like Lando.
Even though he kind of stabbed his friends in the back?
Yeah, but he makes up for it.
I guess.
It's true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the snow scene in The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes. I thought the monster was terrifying.
That part was remade in the updated version.
Really?
Yes. They originally did not show much of the snow monster
I did not know that.
There are many changes to the old films.
I wish I could see the original.
Me too.
It probably had a much more organic feel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading the other day that Yoda's toes change.
Toes change?  That makes no sense.
Let me explain more.  Depending on the movie you're watching, the number of toes he has changes.
That's a very interesting fact.
Guess how many toes he has in Phantom Menace
Two?
Three actually.  Guess how many in all the other movies?
Four?
Correct!  Apparently it was a change for when they redeveloped the costume suit.
You would have thought they would have kept it the same for continuity purposes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Darth maul or darth vader?
Dude, what kind of question is that.
No getting around this, answer the question.
Darth vader any day.
Oh come now, you think vader can beat a double edge lightsaber?
I think he can just force choke anyone who gets in his way.
Whatever, vaders old and weak, maul would cut him down to size.
Old maybe, but weak? Clearly you are short sighted in the ways of the force.
Don't get me riled up over this, you know I'm right.
Get angry, let the anger flow through you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of blaster does Chewbacca use?
I think it's more of a cross-bow type weapon.
Yeah, but it still shoots out laser blasts.
Yeah, that's true. Maybe that's what he wears around his chest.
Oh right, like a bandolier for laser blast packs.
Yeah. How tall do you think he is?
Over 7 feet for sure.
Yeah, he's a pretty intimidating figure
But very loyal
Yes, very loyal to Han Solo
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
Which one do you mean, The Force Awakens or Rogue One?
The Force awakens. I really liked it.
I thought the storyline was too similar to the original.
Really? Why do you say that?
It started with searching for a Droid on a desert planet, just like A New Hope.
Yes, but that's really the only similarity.
They also destroy a planet like they do in the first movie.
Well, there were some big differences. I thought it was cool that they showed you more about storm troopers.
I have a hard time believing that someone who worked for Sanitation would also be sent into battle as a storm trooper though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi, I like all Star Wars Movies except the prequels?
Really? I think the prequel series are just as good as the others.
Ha! You are a fool, the prequels are the worst and people who like them are dumb!
Well, I actually think they are the smartest of the series, in terms of the plot. The Phantom Menace, for instance has true political intrigue.
But Jar Jar is awful.
Jar Jar is no worse than the ewoks, or even Chewbacca. You just like Chewie more because because he can shoot a gun.
The acting is awful, though, just horrible!
Are you telling me that Mark Hamill was not a whiny little brat as Luke Skywalker? He was just shrill and awful.
But George Lucas ruined the original series to try to make the prequels better.
No, he owns them and made his original vision a reality after years of being patient.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like The Force Awakens.
For the most part I did.
It sounds like you had some problems with the movie.
I didn't like the way they killed off Han Solo.
Everyone was upset about that.
I didn't think Kylo Ren was a strong enough villian to take out Solo.
He was sort of a whiner.
I thought Rey was pretty great.
Did you like BB8?
He was fun but he's no R2D2.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
Yes, but I don't like the prequals
They were not as good as the original
George Lucas made them the way he wanted
Yeah, but they weren't as epic
They certainly weren't a new concept
People came in expecting so much
I am looking forward to the Last Jedi
Luke didn't get any lines in the last one!
I hope he is in this one more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like movies?
Yes
Do you watch star wars?
Yes i love them
Which one is your favorite
The clone wars
Me too
I love c3po
Me too, hes so cool
He looks cool too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the last star wars?
Yes I did, I really enjoyed it.  Did you?
Yes, I loved it. I loved the cameos too.
Do you mean carrie fischer?
Yes and seeing the character of luke in the other one as well.
I enjoyed star wars bringing the original cast back as well. I wonder what they will do now that carrie fischer passed away?
I was wondering how they will handle that as well. Maybe they will have more cgi carrie.
Funny, my dad thought that was just an actress who looked like her.
That is funny. That scene was so impressive. I also loved when vader came on board.
That was my favorite part of that film . It was so good. The lighting the drama of it, just so well done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard anything about this new character that's getting introduced in The Last Jedi?
I don't know much about her. But I have heard that they're working on a Han Solo movie at some point.
It'll be great to see him make the famous Kessel run. Talk about iconic.
Yeah, I'm really sad about what happened to his character in The Force Awakens. I wonder what will happen to Leia.
It's hard to say but I am scared for the worst, given the circumstances. I hope they give her a good send off.
It really feels like the end of an era. But that makes me excited for the beginning of a new one.
That's really what Star Wars is all about, when you think about it. I think Rey has got to be a Skywalker.
Why is that?
Because these movies have always been about the Skywalker lineage. And since we're talking about out with the old and in with the new, it kind of seems like Luke is passing the torch here.
I guess if something did happen to Luke, there wouldn't be any Skywalkers left besides Leia. So maybe you're right about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just learned a whole bunch about star wars movies!
Oh yeah! What?
Did you know they almost used a monkey to play Yoda?
No, I had never heard of that.
Also, the word "Ewok" is never mentioned in the movies.
Are you sure?
Yeah, the name only appears in the script.
Anything else?
The language the Ewoks speak is a combination of Tibetan and Nepalese.
Wow! I thought their language was just gibberish.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One in the movies?
Yes, and I loved how it tied into the New Hope movie.
What did you like about it the most?
The way it explained why the Death Star had the vulnerabilities it had.
I agree. And I think the new characters introduced were very interesting too.
Which of them was your favorite?
I really liked the blind, force sensitive monk Chirrut.
What did you like about him?
His apparent connection to the Force.
Yeah, it was great to see how the Force is present even in those not trained to use it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think of the force awakens?
i did not care for it.
Really? it was a cinematic masterpiece.
i thought rey wasn't that interesting of a character.
she's just as good as luke or anakin, I think.
I disagree.
that is your opinion. kylo is awesome too.
He's not as good as vader or maul though.
the cinematic scenes were amazing too.
I'll give it that to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so excited about Star Wars 8!
Me too!
I wonder if they'll bring Han back.
Doubt it...
Yeah, but it'd be cool.
Are you going to see it in the theater?
Probably.
We should go together.
I would love that!
It's a plan!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best Star Wars villain?
That's easy, Darth Vader all the way.
He was just awesome.  Maybe the best bad guy in movie history.
Yeah, not that many can stand up to him.
He also had the most raw power potential of any character.
This is true, but after his injuries he might have actually been powered down.
I thought that.  He was the best though.
So intimidating too.
Yeah, with that deep voice and the Force choke.
He was just unleashed in Empire Strikes back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Bona Fett in Empire?
Yes. That scene where they had all the bounty hunters lined up was very cool.
I did not think he would end up leaving with Han Solo.
Me neither.
I liked his costume a lot.
Do you think it was odd that they made him a kid in the second episode?
Yes. That was a bit out of place.
I also thought it was funny how they got rid of him in Return of the Jedi.
Didn't he just fall into that pit?
Yes. it was comical.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars prequel movies?
Yes, for the most part.
Which one was your favorite?
I liked The Phantom Menace, primarily for the epic duel between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.
That was pretty cool. Probably the best duel of any of the movies.
I agree. Which prequel did you like the best?
I liked Revenge of the Sith. It upped the visual effects ante, and we got to see two epic duels between Sidious/Yoda and Vader/Kenobi.
That was my second favorite. Those duels I would place in the top 10.
Did you like the way they showed Vader's transformation to the dark side?
No, I thought that it was rushed, and the actor didn't do a great job with the material.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that blasters are way cooler than light sabers.
You've got to be out of your mind! Light sabers are hands down the coolest weapons in the Star Wars universe.
Blasters are long range weapons, you can shoot a guy from across the room with a blaster.
I'll give you that, but close range nothing can beat a light saber.  If someone is right up in your face you don't even have to get the light saber all the way out to be able to disable your enemy.
Han Solo shoots Greedo under the table in the Mos Eisley Cantina from under the table!
Yeah but if he'd had a light saber he could have taken out Greedo and the entire table by just turning it on and flicking his wrist.
Or he could have accidentally sliced his own leg off.
I still agree with Obi Wan in a New Hope when he says that the light saber is a much more elegant weapon for a more civilized time.
Yeah but you have to train for years to use a light saber correctly, all you need is a nobody off the streets to pull a trigger.
Exactly my point! Any idiot can use a blaster, you have to be a real warrior to use a light saber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the movie Rogue One?
Oh yeah, that's one of my favorite Star wars movies so far. Did you like it?
Yeah, I was just really sad about the ending. I liked K2S0 a lot, and I didn't like what happened to him.
That's true but we knew this was going to be a one off. And Director Krennik was really a great character.
I definitely agree. Also having Mads Mikkelson in the movie was excellent.
Yeah the cast was pretty awesome. The last twenty minutes are my favorite part, although it made me sad.
It's interesting to see the forming of the rebellion and the death star plans for sure. Who was your favorite character?
I'd have to say Cassian I think. He's very cool, and he's not afraid to get his hands dirty.
I think the pacing with that movie was perfect. Like they did everything just right.
You're right, it was great. And the battle at the end while they were trying to steal the plans was really epic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rey is one of the Skywalker kids?
No, I do not.
Then why does she have the force?
Maybe she is a new breed of Jedi, maybe something like Anakin was.
What was he?
He was half force and half human, he was made with metachlorins.
The things the force is made up of?
Yes, when Qui Con Gin was speaking to his mom about his skills, she told him that.
And he thought that possible?
No, actually, but he tested him. Anakin's blood was off the chart with metachlorins.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you dug into the Expanded Universe at all?
Yes, although Disney ret-conned most of it.
I know, now it's just Legends!
It's a shame they lost so many great storylines.
Right? How about Timothy Zahns trilogy?
Actually their bringing a piece of that into canon now!
Oh yeah? Like what?
Well, Grand Admiral Thrawn is a character in Rebels now
That's great! He's such an awesome character!
Hopefully they can eventually canonize some other things as well!
XXXXXXXXXXX
kylo ren or vader
is that a serious question.
yes, kylo is cool and the new vader.
he just WANTS to be the new vader.
You're saying he can't be?
he's not as ruthless or as intelligent.
vader was not that intelligent.
maybe but he had darth sidius.
does kylo have a master?
not sure
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot stand some characters in movies and fiction
I mean is that not the same as anyone
No i mean i loathe some of them
What ones
I cannot stand Jar Jar binks he is horrible
Well yeah everyone hates him
I mean i feel like the series would be better if he did not exist
Might be but the plot was written with him in mind
That is exactly the problem
I can see that i guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know much about the Star Wars films?
I'm afraid not.
Why not? Usually everyone loves Star Wars.
I just never got into it.
There's so much that you're missing out on. I recommend you watch at least one of them.
Which one? From what I know, there's a lot.
I would highly recommend The Empire Strikes Back. That one's a classic.
What's so special about it?
Well, you'd have to watch it to find out!
Fair enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what would make an awesome final side movie?  An Obi Wan story.
Yes!  That would be perfect.
I'd like to see him in between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope.
Me too.  Helping the Rebellion and maybe fighting some of Vader's minions.
Even an encounter with the bad man himself.
That would be cool.  Also maybe he's Rey's grandfather.
I've heard that theory, and that would make for some good back story on her.
Yeah it would.  Her past is way too much of a mystery.
Plus Obi Wan was one of the best characters.
And Ewan McGregor played him very well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can not believe the number of meme's there are about Star Wars on the internet.
Well, it is an insanely popular and influential series.
That's true.  I saw one the other day it was outside a coffee shop and they had a picture of Admiral Ackbar with his face next to a coffee cup and he's saying, "It's a frap!"
Haha... yeah, I've seen several of those "It's a trap!" related memes on various place on the web.  One I liked shows young Boba holding his father's helmet and it says, "Take your son to work day.  Not always successful."
Oh, that's terrible!  Funny, but terrible!
I thought so.
Oh, here's a good one, I remember.. what's the inside temperature of a Tantum?
Wait.. were those the creatures on that ice planet in Empire, right?  I don't know, what is the temperature?
Luke Warm.
Ooooh...booo!  Boo!  Hiss!  That's bad!  HAha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Rey in the Force Awakens?
I thought she was great.  I can't wait to see her training with Luke.
Yeah, that will be cool.  Do you think she's his daughter?
Maybe, but that seems like the easy answer.
Yeah I think you're right about that.
I heard possibly her last name was Kenobi and might be his granddaughter.
That would be great as she heard his voice when she first grabbed Luke's old light saber.
Yeah, that was a crazy scene too.
Speaking of crazy, her fight against Kilo Ren was cool
Yeah, her Force powers must be off the scale to over power him like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Since Force Awakens Lea has been in the older movies and now the new one.
Yes she has so?
Well which character do you like more her new one or her old one?
They're the same so how is that even a question?
I mean did you like her before or now in the new movie better?
I would say before because she had more story she played the part well and looked good doing it.
Do you think in her older age she might be more harsh and brutal?
I'm not sure we will have to see.
Do you think she will end up dying in the movies?
I hope not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Star Wars villain?
I think Darth Maul was probably my favorite.
His character design was awesome. I didn't like the movie he was in that much, though.
Yeah, Episode One isn't very well-liked.
You don't think Darth Vader was a better villain?
Vader is more legendary for sure. However, he didn't feel as evil as Darth Maul to me.
I could see that. Vader's lore is very dark but his character doesn't do much to show it.
Plus Darth Maul had that awesome double bladed lightsaber.
That's true. That thing was really cool.
Too bad he ended up getting sliced in half.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
I like Star Trek
You realize what you're saying...!?
Yes
That's like saying that you pray to SATAN!!
Haha!  Lighten up bro!
I could punch you right now!
Bring it on!
(shoves User 2)
(shoves User 1)...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Rey in the star wars movies?
I like that they have a new heroine
I think natalie portman is kind of a boring actress
Yeah, those star wars movies were dreadful
The new ones are fun though
For sure. I'm sad about carrie fisher dying
yeah, at least she got to see the movies
I always wondered if mark hamill is related to dorothy hamill
He's not.
Oh well. He should be in the new star wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What race is Chewbacca?
He is a wookie
Cool
They go into his backstory in Episode 3
Really?
Yes. But, I don't think it was received very well.
I think it would be better to keep his life a secret
Yeah
Did you like his costume?
Yes. The fur was great
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cant believe carrie fisher is still doing the star wars movies
Me either
She still looks good though
Im glad they tried to use the same people
Me too
I hate movies that use different people for every movie
Exactly
It kind of ruins it for me
Me too
Thats another awesome thing aboit star wars
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's that brown guy on Star Wars called?
Chewbacca?
Yeah! I want to watch a Star Wars movie with him in it.
I think he's in all of them. The first one for sure.
Hm, maybe I'll watch the first one. I just think he's so cute!
I like him, too. And Yoda.
I've never watched any so I want to try and get into them.
Yeah, start with the first one. It will help you understand the series.
I'm turning it on right now.
Let me know how you feel about it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch star wars?
Yes
Have you seen the force awakens?
Yes i really enjiyed that movie
Me too
The plot was so good
And there was so much action
Exactly
I hope they make more
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was for favorite film of the Star Wars franchise?
I liked the phantom menace!
Me too!
Really? What part was the best?
The podrace! It was wicked cool.
Yeah, it totally was.
What character was your favorite?
Out of all of them?
Yeah.
Jar Jar Binks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you play video games
Sometimes i do
Do you play any liscened ones ?
Sure from time to time
What is your favorite star  wars game?
Well it depends on what type of game
Out of them all?
Well then i could pick only one?
What one?
Knights of the old republic of course
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Star Wars: Rogue One?
I really liked it, and how it ties in to the series.
I do too, especially how it ends right where Episode 4 starts.
Yeah, the ending with Darth Vader wrecking those resistance fighters was great.
Did you like that ending the best out of all of the Star Wars movies?
I think so, except for the ending of Empire Strikes back.
I like that one too, but Rogue One was so good!
K2SO was my favorite droid out of all of them.
I know, his literal, sarcastic tone is hilarious.
I love Alan Tudyk, the man who does K2SO's voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so sad about Carrie Fisher dying. She made the first Star Wars movies so special.
She really did. Princess Leia was one of the best parts of the original trilogy.
I feel like she was really independent in a way we don't get to see very often with women in action movies.
Yeah! And her storyline is so compelling.
She loses her home in the process of seeking justice.
Right. And she totally gets revenge for it too.
Luke's story is also a revenge story, sort of.
Yeah, there's a lot of revenge going on.
Everyone except Han. He's just in it for the money.
Only at first!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that scene in 'Return of the Jedi' when Leia tells Luke she remembers her mom's face?
Yes I do.
Well, how does Leia remember?  Didn't Padma die during childbirth?
That brings up a very interesting dilemma.  You're right.
Do you think Leia was referring to her adoptive mother?
Or maybe it's possible because Leia is force sensitive, like Anakin and Luke.
I think the Force answer makes more sense narratively than the adoptive mother theory.
Though, perhaps we're giving too much credit.  Maybe it was just a plot hole between the prequel and main series.
That is probably the most likely scenario.
This kind of thing just reminds me why I didn't like the prequel movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love star wars
Me too
Its a great movie
It is
I love the clone wars
I liked that one
What did you like
I reallupy liked the Empire strikes back
That was a good one
I know
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars movies?
I like the Hans Solo character.
Oh, you like the rebel bad boy with a good heart?
Yes, I like the tough guy persona of Han.
I like his relationship with Chewy and Princess Leia
Me too and what about the ship?
Too funny I like how it is always broken down.
The millennium falcon  was always breaking down but always managed to get the job at the last minute.
Too funny how they were always cobbling it back together.
Yes, great addition to the story line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Bobba Fett from Star Wars?
Yes, he was a great character, but when he was introduced in the Empire Strikes Back he did not have that many scenes.
I agree. I wish they gave him more screen time. Even in Return of the Jedi, he did not as much time on screen as he should have.
I was really upset when he fell into the Sarlacc pit in The Return of The Jedi.
I thought that was terrible, also. Jango Fett, who was Bobba's father in Star Wars: Attack of The Clones, had a really cool look to his armor because it was nice and shiney.
Yes, but Bobba, I felt, had a better looking armor because it was more worn, like he had seen a lot of battles.
They both looked completely the same because Bobba was a clone of his father.
That's true because Bobba Fett and the Clone Troopers were clones of Jango.
Bobba Fett was closest to Jango because Jango didn't want him altered like the Clone Troopers were.
yep because Jango wanted a son and someone who was just like he was. Bobba and Jango were great characters and I wish they would have lasted throughout the entire second trilogy and they would have shown Bobba become a bounty hunter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Star Wars?
I never really have been
Really?? But they're classics.
I just never really got in to them.
How is that possible?
For one, I think they're a bit long and drawn out.
Have you actually seen them?
I have seen parts of each
Then how can you make an accurate judgment?
I can't. I just have no interest in seeing them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite film in the entire series.
I think its where we see the Rebel Alliance in its full effect.
Yeah and you can tell vader is at his breaking point with them.
The probe droids were key in it.
Well that was just to find out where Luke and all of them went.
Yeah but I liked a change of pace.
Once the death star was eliminated i didnt think they would do another one.
Vader really made Luke fall into his trap
Well he was after his friend
Yeah the bond between Han and Luke was magical
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Do you like Star Wars?
Absolutely.
If you were a jedi what side would you be on?
Like light or dark?
yeah.
I don't know.  Maybe the dark?
Oh interesting.
They have so much power.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard that Lucas wanted Luke to fall to the Dark Side at the end of Return of the Jedi.
It would have had a certain symmetry, but there isn't enough setup.
Luke wasn't ready to confront Palpatine and Vader.  Yoda said it himself.   If Luke left at the end of Empire Strikes Back, he was guaranteeing his fall.
Audiences wouldn't understand that, though. They'd take Yoda's warnings as being overly fearful.
Yoda knows what he's talking about, though.  Everything in the movies confirm that.
I think that audiences would have needed it to be more explicit, and there would need to be more buildup.  What does Palpatine have to offer Luke?
Nothing.  But that's the point. The Dark Side isn't rational. It's insane.  If you flirt with it, it'll make you insane, too.
It's still difficult to grasp-. No one really wants there to be a giant force of insanity out there. They prefer rational villains.
Lucas didn't, apparently. He liked the Ming the Merciless type of evil for evil's sake.
That's his mistake, I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hey.
Do you like the Star Wars universe?
I do, yes.
What do you like most about it?
I love the jedis and lightsabers.
They are pretty great.
Totally.
Do you have a favorite Jedi?
Mace Windu!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen The return of the Jedi?
I did, about 20 years ago.
It is a great movie.
I think it was alright, but my favorite was the newest one, Rogue One.
Well the Return of the Jedi was well made.
I agree with you there, I like how they were in a forest for most of the movie.
Yeah it was different than the rest of the movies at the time.
I loved the little Ewoks that they introduced in the Return of the Jedi as well.
Those guys were so cute!
I don't think so, I was just happy they helped the rebellion defeat the emperor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How into Star Wars would you say you are?
I really enjoy them, lot's of special effects.
The old ones are still classic but for some reason I get excited to see the newer ones.
The characters are hard to keep up with but I love Chewbacca.
LOL! What ever happened to JarJar BInks?
I have no idea but didn't you name your dog after him.
Yes, funny you remember that. Darth Vader is a bad ass.
I know, LUKE I AM YOUR FATHER.
You da daddy. OH a shame about Carrie Fisher. I guess she was on a lot of drugs.
R.I.P. Princess Lea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that scene is "Attack of the Clones" where Yoda went all crazy?
All crazy? Oh wait, yeah, that one battle scene?
Yeah, haha, when he was all flipping and jumping everything against Count Doku! That was awesome!
That was so funny. The entire series, he's all old and frail looking and then he whips out all of those cool battle moves!
I know, the entire theater was laughing so loud when that scene happened!
And then goes back to hobbling away with his cane after the battle. That was so funny!
Yeah, Yoda is really a great character. One of my favorite Jedi in the series for sure.
I wish they would have had him do more scenes like that in the other movies.
I know right, but at least we got to see it once!
Go Yoda! haha
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved Rogue One. What did you think of the ending?
The ending was sad, but it was appropriate.
At first, I couldn't believe that Jyn and Cassian had to die!
I know, right? It was hard to figure out the reasoning.
But I like the way George Lucas wove it into the original series and showed how the plans to the Death Star were acquired by the republic.
Me too. It provided a lot of backstory.
The mind-blowing part for me was when Princess Leia was featured at the end. It was so awesome.
I agree. It set the movie off perfectly.
But it was so sad to hear soon after the release of the movie that Carrie Fisher died.
I know, I was heartbroken. I heard that in future movies, Disney will not use her likeness in CGI for upcoming movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rouge One?
Yeah I loved it, the effects were incredible.
Oh yeah it looked amazing, Donnie Yen played such a cool character.
Yeah when he was walking blindly through all the gun fire it was sick.
I couldn't believe how good it was, I think I liked it better than Episode Seven to be honest.
yeah me too, its funny cause its not even part of the main movies.
Yeah really, but it leaves me hopeful for the other in between movies, like the one about Han Solo.
True and it got me even more hyped for Episode Eight.
Comes out in December though of course so we have a long wait.
Yeah unfortunately, I can't wait for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like the Empire Strikes Back.
Even with all of the new films that have come out since then?
Yep, even with all of them.
What do you like about it so much?
Well a lot of different things!
For example?
Well I definitely think it has the best story out of any of the films. It's pretty dark and there's a lot of conflict and you just don't know what's going to happen.
Yeah, it's definitely not nearly as bright and cheery as the first movie was.
and this might be a weird thing to like, but I like the sets and landscapes of that film the best. Hoth, the asteroid field, Dagobah, Cloud City, the carbonite freezing chamber. They're just the coolest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever watch the star wars movies?
Yes sometimes.
Who is your favorite character?
I like Jarjar Binks.
Oh he is very funny!
That is why I like his character.
I heard he is basically a stereotype though.
That may be true but I have not personally heard that.
What about Chewy?
I like Chewy too he is great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know if they'll be doing a spinoff movie about Obi-Wan Kenobi?
I think I heard they will.
That would be awesome! Can't wait for that.
They've already put some fan videos on Youtube.
I'll have to check that out.
Funny ones..you should.
So I guess there were about 20 lost years that he spent on Tattoine, keeping an eye on Luke.
When he must have had some adventures.
So thats the timeframe they'll cover?
I'm pretty sure.That's what I heard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rouge One?
Yes, I loved it.  I was worried when they said Darth Vader was going to be in it but it was great.
I am sorry that they all died because I want another movie
Same, give me more
How did you feel about Leia at the end
I was crying, I saw it after Carrie died
It was a good surprise
This is exactly what I needed to see
It made me excited to the Last Jedi, even though they are not related
They are just making better movies now
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the better Vader was?  Hayden or Jones?
James Earl Jones for sure, such a better actor.
I'm not sure, Anikan in the prequels has more scree time.  Jones is just a fear factor. Not to mention voice only.
Dude you're crazy.  Hayden was a winey little punk in episode 2.  And not as good an actor.
You're right about the acting.  But his fighting was much better.
You mean the stunt double with the same hair cut?
Sorry, I just enjoyed watching Vader develop.
Yeah, that was cool.  I just wish they would have chosen a better actor.
Lets agree on this.  Jar Jar binks was the low part of the franchise.
Oh man don't get me started.
XXXXXXXXXXX
To me, the best Star Wars is the first one.
Yeah, me too, I love it!
It is still visually stunning, even after all these years.
Yes, I love the scenes when they are flying in space, it looks real!
The Death Star looks so ominous sitting there like a planet that is meant just for attacking other planets.
Hey, was the the Star Wars where they all got stuck in that garbage place?
You mean that gross room that had the walls closing in, it was compacting the trash?
Yes, and Chewy was barking about the smell!
I laughed at that, I don't know if Chewy is a dog man, a bear man or what!
Hey's he's a Chewbacca oops, I mean a Wookie!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rey is going to end up being Luke's daughter?
No I dont see that as a plausible end
They could flip the script on all of us!
I think you have a better chance of Jabba the Hut being a human.
True, I just wish they would have more plot twists.
I think Finn and her may end up together
So it could be like a Leia and Han type of thing.
Yeah I wish Han was in this one too.
Well they sort of cant do that.
I hope this wraps up some storylines though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to be in a star wars movie one day
Well it is possible now
Why was not possible before
Well obviously you know
Nah i am not sure
Well they stopped making them for a long time
Well oh yeah that makes sense i kinda forgot it is a modern revival
Nah it is ok people seem to forget
Well i guess i should practice my auditions
Yeah you should practice them for awhile might get good at it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw the first Star Wars movie when it came out in theaters.
Do you mean "Star Wars IV: A New Hope?"
Yes, and I saw "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" when they were released in theaters.
When was the first movie released?
"A New Hope" was released in 1977.
Have they released all of the movies in the series?
No, they are supposed to start filming Episode IX in 2017.
I heard that the filming was delayed due to Carrie Fisher's death.
Yes, she was supposed to have a key role in episode IX.
Now they have to make some changes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lightsaber or blaster, what would you choose?
Lightsaber
I would go with a blaster
But a lightsaber could deflect a blaster
Yeah, but you need Jedi skills do use a lightsaber
But Finn used a lightsaber without being a Jedi
I don't remember that
And Han Solo used one in the snow world to cut open that one animal thing
Oh yeah, I remember that one
So I guess a lightsaber is better
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Darth Plagueis The Wise was actually still alive during the Phantom Menace era?
No I actually did not know that. I know that he was the one who trained Sidious.
Yeah, actually he did discover Sidious back on Naboo, and had been lurking in the shadows ever since. His original plan was to co-rule from the shadows with Palpatine as Chancellor.
I guess we know how that turned out!
Yeah, the Sith's plans never seem to actually go as planned. Sidious ended up killing him in his sleep.
Speaking of, I was really sad that Darth Maul got killed off in The Phantom Menace.
He really was the best bad guy of that whole series of movies. It's depressing that he went out like that.
I would have preferred him over General Grievous any day. Talk about a way better villian!
I didn't like how they kept introducing villains and then just killing them off in the same movie. Have some continuity.
Yeah. These one off bad guys are lame. I need consistency in my villains!
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like star wars?
I love it and george lucas so much.
He really did a great job creating the original movies at least.
You don't like them all?
Not really, The ones george made in 2000s were not nearly as good.
I do agree the original three were the best.
I think DISNEY has done a great job on the newest ones.
I agree, but it makes me sad they are out of lucas's hands.
It is a little sad because he was the creator and mastermind of this world and now being run by someone else.
But he made a ton of money and I think probably happy his universe is living on still.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Star Wars movies do you think will be made?
Thats a tough call
I think they keep developing them for as long as humanity is around.
At one point you have to stop.
They are going to CGI Carrie Fisher
Yeah and that seems bad.
Like morally wrong?
Not that, but just write her out.
Maybe thats what will happen
We will have to wait to see
XXXXXXXXXXX
What year did Return of the Jedi come out?
I think 1983
That long ago?!
Yes, crazy. We were just little kids back then
I loved the ewoks.
Yeah, but if you watch it now it seems really campy with the ewoks
Oh really, I haven't seen it lately
Yeah, it definitely hasn't aged well.
I guess that makes sense considering how long it's been
Yeah, some parts still hold up well
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that really funny scene in the new Episode II movie?
Which one was Episode II?
Episode II is Attack of the Clones.
I actually skipped over that one because it got pretty bad reviews.
It wasn't as bad as everybody made it out to be.
Okay, so what is this funny scene?
It's something that Darth Vader says.
I thought Vader didn't exist in that time?
He does but as an adolescent. He drones on about how much he hates sand!
That's not very befitting of a major villain!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who's under rated in Star Wars?  The Emperor.
Oh I agree, he fooled the Jedi for decades undetected and destroyed them.
Yeah, that takes impressive skill.
Plus his fight against Yoda was totally epic.
Yeah it was.  They were toe to toe but he had the high ground on Yoda.
I've never been able to figure out if he lost on purpose to Mace or not.
I kind of think he did.  All that happening at the exact right time?
Yeah, way too much of a coincidence.
But at the same time, Mace Windu is no slouch.  Toying with him could be dangerous.
Yes it could be, but they took care of him in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about star wars
Okay im good with that
I love those movies
Me too
I still cant believe the part where darth vadar told luke he was his father
I know that was crazy
I watched a video in kids reactions to it
I bet that was fun
It was you should look it up
I will
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like the first one for sure.
Do you mean episode 4 or episode 1?
Oh that's funny. I was thinking Episode 1.
Oh I see, the one with Young Anakin?
Yeah that's the one!
I like the older movies, from the 70s
I like them too but the special effects arent good
Yeah the action can be a little cheesy but I still like it
Yeah, Darth Vaders voice is a little funny to me too. Not sure why.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever wonder where the Rancor came from?
What is the Rancor?
It's the big beast that Jabba the Hutt would feed prisoners to.
Oh yeah, the one that Luke finally kills when he closes the gate on it.
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah, that thing was pretty gross
So where do you think it came from?
Probably some obscure alien planet.
Yeah, maybe from the Dagoba system
Ha! Yeah, where Yoda lived.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best part about The Empire Strikes Back?
I think that the Hoth battle is one of the most exciting parts.
Did you know that Frank Oz did the voice of Yoda in that movie?
Yes!  Yoda is one of the most powerful characters ever written into a movie.
Do you think that Yoda will make an appearance in The Last Jedi?
I don't know - I hope so - maybe as a Force Ghost?
Yeah, I wonder if Obi-wan's voice will be used when Luke and Rey are on Ahch-To.
The trailer when then showed Ahch-To and Rey using her lightsaber was spectacular!
Yeah, just can't wait - I'm curious to see how it all fits into Episode IX.
I hope that the ending of the final episode with Luke, Kylo, Rey, and Snoke is epic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you want to see that upcoming Star Wars film?
The Last Jedi? Yeah, I'm quite excited about it, I am going to see it on opening day.
Me too. It looks do dark and interesting like the Empire Strikes Back. Do you feel the same way?
Yes, but I'm more interested in what they'll do with Luke Skywalker. We haven't seen him in over 20 years.
Yeah, I wish they had kept Han Solo alive long enough for him and Luke to meet again.
I agree, it would have been great to see Luke, Han, and Leia be with each other one more time.
I like the new characters too, though. I am quite partial to Kylo Ren.
I like Kylo also, and I like Finn as well. My favorite character is probably Rey though.
I thought they did a lot of good with Rey in The Force Awakens. I hope they continue with her in the new movie.
I can't wait to see all of our favorite characters together again in The Last Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I liked the new star wars movie. How about you?
It was good but I wish Han Solo hadn't died at the end.
I know. It was really sad but also a powerful scene.
Do you think Kylo Ren will remain on the dark side or do you think Rey can bring him back?
I hope he can be redeemed like Darth Vader. He seemed conflicted at times so maybe he still has some good in him.
The movie raised so many questions and left us with such a cliffhanger. I Wish they had told us more about how Kylo Ren ended up the way he did.
I agree. And what was with that scene where he talked to Darth Vader's remains. It was weird.
They had a chance to give us more insight into what drove Kylo towards the dark side of the force but they just left me confused.
Hopefully the next movie "The last Jedi" will answer some of the questions they raised in the Force Awakens.
I wonder if Finn also has the force.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite force ability throughout the Star Wars series?
I would have to say my favorite is the electricity ability that Senator Palpatine uses.
Mine is the sheer power of moving things that Count Dooku has.
Yeah, its pretty impressive that he was able to move things easier than Yoda.
I can't even believe Annakin managed to kill Count Dooku.
Annakin made it look easy too, I don't think he would have killed him if Senator Palpatine didn't order him to.
Probably, the senator was always trying to play with Annakins conscience.
I'll bet that if Annakin never knew Senator Palpatine, he wouldn't have joined the Sith.
Oh for sure, especially since Senator Palpatine told him Sith powers could save his wife from dying.
Yeah, that's really horrible how they played on his love for Padamane.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many more Star Wars movies do you think they will make?
Well, at least make a trilogy.
So two more?
I think they will of the actual story line after the next one.
Then what?
Maybe add more like back story movies, like the Solo one.
I hope they do not.
I do, people love Star Wars.
I love the feel of it, but not if it is too much. Too much of a good thing you know?
I would still like to see as many as they could put out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I liked Empire Strikes Back
What about that one is best?
It's best because we get to see Luke being trained
That was a great thing to see
It was a complete transformation of a character
Do you think Luke should have gone to help his friends?
Yes, it was the right thing to do
What was your favorite scene in the movie
I liked when Darth Vader revealed he was Luke's father
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the prequels of Star Wars or the original trilogy?
The original trilogy.
Who do you like better Hans or Luke?
That's a hard decision, I like both the same.
I prefer Han's Solo more, but Luke is cool to.
Why do you like Solo more?
I love Harrison Ford plus I love his character arc.
Yea Han Solo's character arc is great and is better than Luke.
So why do you like Luke more.
Because hes a Jedi and has a light saber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Disney has been doing a great job on making movies these days, especially the Star Wars movies.
I agree. The Force Awakens was a surprise to me in how good it was. I think Disney was wise to hire JJ. Abrams to direct the movie.
I think with a foundation as huge as Star Wars and 245 Million budget, JJ. Abrams could not go wrong.
Correct. Do you think that the Last Jedi will be as great?
I plan on it being so. I'm really hoping that Luky Skywalker plays more of a part in the Last Jedi then the little bits and pieces he had in the Force Awakens.
I would think we will see more of Mark Hamill, because I believe his character Luke is the Last Jedi.
What about Carrie Fischer and her Leia character?
God rest her soul, but I am hoping to see JJ. Abrams and Disney incorporate Princess Leia into the Last Jedi.
I think many of her fans are hoping and praying for that as well.
We can only wait and see what the future holds in store for The Last Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite side
Side of what
For star wars
Well what do you mean
In regards to sith or not
Well i love sith
So you would join the same
That what you would do
That is exactly!
That is pretty awesome
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
C3PO
Why him?
He always helps
But he doesn't do much
Without him they would have all died
True.
And I'm like him
Okay I see now - so you can relate more to him
exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Harrison Ford wishes he played more roles in Star Wars
You mean besides Hans Solo
No, I mean like in more than 4 films.
No I think he had quite a career after he did the first 3.
But Hans was a great character for him
He was but the tension he had with Carrie Fisher on screen was odd
I did not sense that besides the romantic feelings.
It felt like it was out of place.
Lucas didnt really write those kinds of films.
Yeah and unfortunately that was on display
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think Mace Windu was able to best Darth Sidious in the lightsaber battle in Revenge Of The Sith?
Well it's said that Windu was one of the best saber duelists among the jedi, and that he utilized his special technique called Vaapad.
I almost think that the emperor was kind of holding back because he knew his precious Anakin was going to come. And if Anakin came and saw him standing over Mace instead of the other way around, his mind might not have been changed.
It's true, you make an excellent point. And the emperor always seemed to be 20 steps ahead of everyone else.
I mean did you see how easily he took out those other jedi at the beginning of that battle? It was like instantaneous!
He really is powerful. Not even Yoda could stop his rise to power.
He was an expert manipulator. No sith has even been on his level in that regard.
Well we're in agreement there. It helped that the Jedi were way too proud and arrogant.
True. Did you know that the reason Mace Windu had a purple lightsaber was because Samuel L. Jackson personally requested it?
Oh wow I didn't know that. But it makes sense, he always has been the kind of actor who wanted to stand out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your least favorite Star Wars?
Definitely Attack of the Clones.
Yeah, Anakin was so annoying.
I can't believe that whole "I don't like sand." line.
That and the romance was so stale and robotic.
I didn't believe those two loved each other at all.
No. Though I suppose it's good Jar Jar was barely in it.
A few seconds of Jar Jar is a few seconds too many.
Yeah, even C3PO was kind of annoying.
Worst movie ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about movies
Alright
Do you like star wars
Of course
They are really good movies
My boyfriend andi just rewatched them together
I should do that
It was fun
It sounds like fun
Glad to help
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie was your least favorite?
Star Wars the clone wars.
Why is that?
Well I just did not like the plot, just felt forced.
What did you think of Jar Jar Binks?
I did not like him as a character he felt really out of place.
He looks the part though yeah his character is a little goofy though.
It was very off putting for me.
I think that was one of my favorite movies of the franchise.
That's interesting guess we all have different tastes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
how did you like rogue 1
it was cool
they kinda filled in a certain plothole
they did a whole movie to fill that plot hole
the question of how they got the information to beat the death star
so many people died though
yeah and especially during that vader scene
the one of him slashing everyone?
yeah, he was brutal
it was intense
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars flick?
Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope the one that started it all!
Any fond memories of this?
I saw this when I was 11 years old. My best friend`s father took me to it, and I can still remember it today.
What did you like about it?
I found it fun most of all,plus the characters stood out.
Any particular characters stand out?
I really liked Luke Skywalker he was the one I could relate to at age 11.
Yep,the samething with Luke with me.
He was a special character.May the Force be with you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
WHich is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I just love Episode 1
Why
I think it bring together the original 3 and the spisodes 1, 2, and 3 so well
I just thought it was a little ovr the top
not me I loved it, also it was the first star wars in about 20 years so it was great
who was your favorite character
Jar Jar
Jar Jar why?
He was silly, clumsy, and funny
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Empire Strikes Back when it first came out?
I did! It was a huge cliff-hanger.
I can't imagine having to wait all that time to find out what happened to Han.
It was really hard! I figured he'd get rescued, but I wasn't sure how.
What did you think about the Han and Leia romance?
Oh, I thought that was great. They're such a feisty couple.
I also liked Luke training with Yoda. Yoda's so funny!
He is, and it was great getting to see Luke really becoming a Jedi knight.
But I'm glad that I can go straight to the next movie to see the happy ending!
Lucky you! I had to wait three years for the next installment.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite ship in Star Wars?
I like the Emperor shuttle?
Why?
It's roomy and seems cool.
I never got into the Sith storyline.
I wasn't a big fan of all the prequels but the original trilogy was really good.
What did you think about Jar Jar Binks?
He's terrible.  What were the writers thinking?
I know.  Maybe they were trying to be more inclusive.
Ha ha.  Just like Jazz on Transformers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where you suprised that Aniken Skywalker is Darth Vader?
Totally. In revenge of the sith I can't belive he killed all of the Jedi recuits.
Yeah I was suprised. That is when I understoid why Jedis were not supposed to have romantic relationships.
Yeah someone that powerful would do anything for the person they love.
But would you ever be temped to go to the dark side?
Totally they have no rules. Jedis have too many rules.
I don't know. That's what keeps them in check.
Too many rules. If they didn't have all those rules Qui Gon Jin could have had a second apprentice and maybe Anikien would not have gone to the dark side.
That is very interesting. Do you thing Obi Wan was not ready?
Yes. They gave him a powerful boy who was too old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like Star Wars?
Yeah sure.
Do you have a least favorite movie?
Least favorite?
Yeah.
That's easy.
What is it?
The first prequel.   It was terrible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about star wars
Awesome i love star wars
They are great movies
I really enjoyed them
I lile the empire strikes back
That was a really good one
I read the budget was 18 million
Wow that was alot back then
Yes it was
Its crazy
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Clone Wars series?
Yes, I have seen most of them but not the last season.
Oh nice, are you planning on finishing it?
I want to, I just haven't found the time.
You should! The animation and production quality of that show got better and better each season.
I agree, it was a really well made show.
By the time they got to the sixth season it was a master piece of animation.
What is your favorite episode?
I have to say if I had to pick one it would be the one where Ashoka gets framed for killing the prisoner and the council disowns her.
I loved that episode too, I think there were several about that part of the story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rouge One?
Yes. i thought it was pretty good.
Yeah I'm kinda excited about every other year seeing a Star Wars story. Kinda an off shoot.
Yeah It was cool to see how the actually got the blue prints for the death star.
Yeah it was. How did you feel about the force awakens?
It was good but there was too much "Star Wars" to keep the e trend fans of the original movies happy.
Yeah but I still liked it. It had some good really funny parts to break it up.
I'm excited to see how powerful Luke skywalker is. Since he is the last Jedi.
I knew Hans solo was going to die. Harrison ford was getting too old.
Yeah. I was still sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You may not have known this, but Luke Skywalker originally had a different name.
Let me guess: Dennis the Space Guy.
You're such a clever dude.  No, it was not that.
Well, what was it?
He was going to be called Luke Starkiller?
Starkiller?  I don't get why they thought that would be a good idea.
They originally thought the name sounded cool so that's why they went with.
Probably a good thing they changed his name.
Yep, right before production started, they changed it to something more appropriate for his character.
Luke Starkiller - I have to admit, does sound pretty cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Light Saber or Blaster?
Huh?
Han or Luke?
What are you talking about?!
Star Wars.
Your'e such a dork.
Yes, but the question stands.
I'll have to go with the blaster.
Why?
I'd cut my arm off with a lazer sword!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Anakin Skywalker must be saved
Uh..he kind of killed a bunch of people.
Yeah, but he saves the day! He's a tortured soul.
Okay. So is Kylo Ren, but I don't care about his greasy self.
Really? Even after everything he's been through?
Okay, what has he been through? I get Anakin, but what has Kylo Ren been through?
He lost his father!
He killed his father, you're out.
He's cute.
You're going to hell.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the funniest Star Wars character?
C-3PO
I like him too. R2-D2 is funny as well.
Their relationship is so sweet.
Yes. It gets built really well in the original movie.
Did you like the scene where they are lost in the desert?
Yes. That is one of my favorites.
Did you like them in the newest movie?
Not really. They did not do much.
Yes. They were sort of stagnant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the star wars movies?
Yes i love them
Thats good
Do you?
Yes they are so good
Who is your favorite character?
Princess laya
Shes so pretty
What about you
Yoda
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched star wars
Yes im a nerd like that
Its okay so am i
I love return of the jedi and the clone wars
Ive always love the empire strikes back
Thats a really good one
Yes, my favorite
It came out so long ago
Yes theres always been a big gap between movies
I wonder why
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Empire Strikes Back
Oh yeah, the best one of the trilogy
Yeah, I liked how real it seemed
Yes, definitely went deep
Yoda, Darth Vader, snow base, cloud city. It had it all
Yes and don't forget Lando
Oh yeah, one of the greatest characters ever
Yeah, I liked Billy Dee Williams in that role
He was a traitor though
But then he came back in the end
XXXXXXXXXXX
Being a force ghost returns you to your optimum age. That's why Anakin is younger than Darth Vader
Says who?
Nobody said it is so. It's just assumed.
Well that doesn't make sense.
You know what doesn't make sense? You trying to make sense of everything. Why can't you just enjoy the movie?
I am an analytical individual. I like to analyze things.
Well, Star Wars is too complex to be analyzed. It's meant to be just enjoyed.
It's more enjoyable when I analyze things, including Star Wars.
But the plot is too complex to be thoroughly analyzed without having to watch it a few times. And it evolved over the last 3 decades so much
That's the main reason. the movies themselves are not that complex. but all the follow up storylines that evolved over the years make the prequels confusing, and sequels even more so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars II came on TV last night , do like the Star Wars movies.
Yes!, I love  Star Wars episode IV -  when Darth Vader enters the movie.
I like the episode when C-3PO leaves R2-D2 in the dessert and they are arguing.
Did you know  Darth Vader is Princess Leia father?
Yeah, and Luke Skywalker is her brother.
I like the episode when Obi Wan vs Darth Vader.
I like all the episodes of Star wars , I have the DVD collection.
I also like the episode" Revenge of the Sith".
Did you like the episode "Empire Strikes Back"?
Yes!, I also like," Return of the Jedi", both excellent movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best light saber duel?
Without a question, it would go to Anakin and Obiwan's duel
That duel had more riding on it
Their duel in episode IV had some of the same feeling
After seeing episode III, you could tell Obiwan only lost the second time because of his age
It was one of the saddest deaths in the movies
Obiwan's death was put there to help develop Luke as a character, for theatrical purposes as well
It showed not everyone in the Empire was incompetent
Yes, it showed how much Luke improved over the original trilogy
Obiwan seemed like a much stronger Jedi when you see the full story
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of The Force Awakens?
I didn't like Rey.
Why not? I liked her.
I thought she was too powerful and had a flat personality.
Did you like Finn?
Yes, I liked him a lot more.
He was pretty funny.
His actor has a knack for comic timing.
What about Kylo Ren?
I was worried he would just be a copy of Darth Vader. It's interesting that he is so much more than that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to have a Star Wars movie marathon.
Let's do ot.  Which one do we start eith?
I don't know.  By release date would be Star Ward.
Then Empire Strikes Back.
But what about the order on the story?
It would be Phantom Memace.
No, Rogue One came before all those.
That's right.  They paved the way.
Then after Rogue One it is Phantom Menace.
Then Attack of the Killer Clones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like The Phantom Menace?
No; JarJar Binks was annoying and Young Anakin Skywalker didn't act very well.
Oh; I did think the acting of the Young Anakin was a little stiff, but JarJar was hilarious!
I guess, JarJar did get less annoying, to me, in the Clone Wars, mainly because he got less screen time.
Oh ya, I did realize that. Now that you mention that, JarJar did play a pretty big role in Episode one, and by Reveng of the Sith, he was barely in the film at all.
Ya. I wish we would have seen more of Jaba the Hutt and his backstory more.
Kind of like they did with Jenga Fett?
Exactly, though the Fetts were always more popular than the Hutts to the majority of the audience
Right. It was interesting finding out where all the Clones, and in turn Stormtroopers came from in The Clone Wars
Totally, and maybe that explains why the Stromtroopers had such bad aim, it had something to do with the cloning process being duplicated for generations. *haha*
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the older movies are better than the new ones?
Well, now that depends.  Are you talking about the force awakens or episode 1 through 3?
I'm talking about episode 1 through 3.
Then, no, I don't think they are better.
You at least have to have a favorite character from them.
Yeah.  Although Yoda's epic light-saber duel was pretty cool, I have to say that Jar Jar Binks is my favorite character.
No way! Have you read the fan fiction about how Jar Jar is really a Jedi?
Yes, and I think its garbage.  However, Jar Jar did play a controversial role in helping young Skywalker.
Now there is a dark character.  It's too bad that things didn't work out with Padme.
Yes, anger turned him to the dark-side, which prevented their relationship from really taking off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars Character?
It's a tie, between Yoda and Vader.
Interesting, opposite sides.
That's what makes them so good.  They are both so powerful and have such interesting back stories.
You know who I always loved?  Han, I bet he has a good back story.
Yeah I bet you're right.  He has all types of things he's done being a smuggler and all.
And how about his escapes from bounty hunters?
I like him and Chewy as a team.  It will be great to finally see how they met.
Yeah, and the Lando Han relationship.  Would be great to know what happened.
Like how Han got the Falcon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read the other day that a lot of the structure of Star Wars was based Akira Kurosawa movies.
What are those?
Old samurai flicks. But once you see them, it totally makes sense.
How so?
Like, Luke losing his home and having to fight is a plot point in a lot of samurai movies.
Hmm. Interesting.
And they do fight with swords, despite being in space and having guns.
Well, lightsabers are basically lasers.
Yeah, but it still reminds me of a sword.
I can see that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the chances that were made to the Star Wars films?
I don't mind them, but the original should be out there still.
Yes, you cannot get a copy of it at all.
I liked the original because it looked more like a film.
Yeah and a lot of the characters were changed as well.
What did you like about the updates?
Nothing really. I thought it made the film worse.
Yes, I agree. Luckily there was not much to change about episode 5.
Yeah, that one is my favorite still.
I think Yoda makes that one amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, can you help me out here?
Sure. What are you doing?
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.
Oh, I'm not very good at those.
This one is different. It is a Star Wars crossword puzzle.
Oh, awesome! How can I help?
Well, I''m on my last word.
What's the question?
Dark Vader's mother?
Shmi Skywalker, of course! That was an easy one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love star wars
The movies?
Yes
I love them too
I have all the movies
Me too and the little action figures
I've always wanted those
They have them on amazon
I'll have to check it out
You will love them
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Star Wars soundtrack is so iconic... It gets stuck in my head all the time!
Mine too! Especially the song that plays when Darth Vader walks on screen.
Right! It's so sinister, it's perfect for him.
The other bits of the soundtrack are great too. It always makes me so nostalgic.
I wonder if the soundtrack for the new films will feel like way in another ten years?
They might! People seemed to really enjoy The Force Awakens.
When does the next one come out?
It's supposed to be this September!
Great! What's it called?
"The Last Jedi."
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey baby, do you want to do some roleplay tonight?
Can we do a star wars theme?
Sure Who do you want to dress up as?
I was thinking either Princess Leia or Padamei
Man that's a tough choice I think I might be leaning more towards Padamei
Why because you had the hots for her in the movies?
Well Duh?  (chuckles)  Do you want to head over to the halloween shop and get some costumes?
Absolutely let me get my shoes on
Okay, i'll wait for you in the car
Sounds good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear there's going to be a Boba Fett movie?
I heard about it. Then I heard it was cancelled!
I heard it's back in on again! I'm excited about it. Boba Fett has been one of my favorite characters in the Star Wars universe.
He's definitely a big fan favorite, and it's funny if you think about it because he doesn't say much. If they're planning on it again that's great news!
I don't think he's ever uttered a word! His first appearance was in Return of the Jedi right?
He was in the whole original Trilogy! George Lucas later added him into Star Wars.
I didn't realize it! It must have been the new remastered digital releases.
That makes a lot of sense, since Boba Fett was really a branch or character that was connected to Han Solo's background.
Yes, originally he was in Empire Strikes back and Return of the Jedi but on the remastered Star Wars, Lucas brought him in.
That's so good, I'll have to watch for him when I watch the Star Wars Trilogy again this weekend!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars The Force Awakens?
Yes it was so good
I loved carrie Fisher in it
She was really good
Shes so talented
She does leia so good
Harrison ford was good to
Hes also a great actor
They did a good job with the casting
Yes they did
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a saddest part of Star Wars?
I think when Anakin is burning is a sad part
Why do you say that?
He is getting burned slowly by lava and doesn't get any help?
Who was nearby to help him?
Obi Wan was right there!
And Obi Wan didn't help him?
Not at all, he let him burn
I thought Obi Wan was good?
Yeah but Anakin was so angry that he would take every chance to hurt Obi Wan at that time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that fat worm thing in the STAR WARS movie?
I think it was Jaba the Hut.
He looked like he smelled bad.
And he had Princess Leia as a pet.
Yeah, he had her on a chain.
And C3-P0 stood behind Jaba.
I think C3-PO did translations for Jaba.
And R2-D2 served drinks on a tray.
It was like Jaba was king.
And they were having a party all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In the new Star Wars movie, why is Klyo so crazy about a grandpa he never met.
They never really say, I imagine he thinks they have something in common.
Why? I mean he has powers but no one made him dark.
He is very powerful, but the dark side has more power.
So, maybe he wanted to have more power, make his grandpa proud.
Maybe, even though Vader turned good at the end.
He even visited Luke in a, what is that, a force ghost?
Yes, on Endorine. At the part, he did so that means he some how died a Jedi.
Even though he lived most his life as a sith.
He began the turn long before he got the mask.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in Star Wars?
That's a tough questions. I think Obi Wan is my favorite.
I like Obi Wan a lot too although he is responsible for helping train Darth Vadar.
Ya that's a good point he didn't always make the best choices.
I think it would have been better if he had listened to Yoda.
Ya yoda did warn him not to train Anikan but then he insisted because of the death of Qui Gon Jinn
Ya I guess Obi Wan didn't want to train him at first.
Ya that's a good point. Without Qui Gon Anakin would have stayed with him mom.
Ya maybe he would have been happier if he had never left to become a Jedi.
That's a great point and then he would have been there to save hiis mom.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the latest Star Wars movie?
The Force Awakens, yes.
No, the other one, Rogue One
I didn't catch that one
Really? It was pretty good.
Who was in it?
No real big named actors, but everyone in it did a good job
Hmmm, I'll have to check it out
Yes, for sure. I highly recommend it
Okay, I'm all for a good Star Wars movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Stars Wars movie?
I like Episode IV the most
What's that one called again?
A New Hope
Oh yeah, that one was awesome.
Yeah it was really popular when it came out
People like the movie's effects so much!
Yeah like the light sabers, those were high tech graphics then!
Now it seems cheesy, even Vader's voice seems funny to some
But that's how it goes, I still like the movie's actors and effects anyway!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is better, Leia or Rey?
Rey
Why do you think that?
She has more experience fighting and grew up on her own
I think Leia was better
Why?
She had more diplomatic experience, plus she was a fighter
Yeah, but Rey could pilot the Falcon
I thought that was a bit questionable
I thought it was really cool to watch her fly it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars prequel movies?
You mean like Phantom Menace and all those? Yeah I like them
They're not my favorite movies. What did you like about them?
Well a lot of the characters they introduced were really cool. I especially like Darth Maul, even though he was only in one movie briefly
I hear they might make an Obi-Wan movie and that Darth Maul will still be alive in it
Really? That would be extremely cool, I'd watch it
Yeah, even though I don't like the prequel movies, I think Ewan McGregor did a great job as Obi-Wan
So do I. And I hear he'd like to be in an Obi-Wan movie if they make it
Well now I think they absolutely have to make it! What if Liam Neeson came back as the ghost of Qui-Gon?
That would make it even better! Qui-Gon is such an underrated character in the series
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, let's list our favorite battle scences in order of movie. I'll start with the Death Star fighter battle from a New Hope.
Okay, then I respond to you with the Death Star battle from Return of the Jedi
Okay, that would have been my second, so I'll have go with the main battle in Empire Strikes Back.
Yeah, that's my number two favorite as well.
My next favorite is the Battle of Geononsis in Attack of the Clones.
Yeah, that's a good one, but I'm more partial to the Battle of Courscant in Revenge of the Sith.
Who you like vehicle battles do you? What would you rate higher, the BAttle of Scarif or the battle of StarKiller Base?
I'd have to go with the battle of Scarif, more variety of vehicles and comabt types.
True, the base of Starkiller is mostly a fighter battle with Ren and Rey's saber duel inbetween.
Yeah, but it nowhere near as epic as Obi-wan and Anakin's duel on Mustafar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, can I ask you a question? About Star Wars?
Sure, what's up?
Do you think all the people on Alderaan died? I mean, ALL of them?
What do you mean? The planet blew up, right?
Well yeah, but... I mean, there had to be some people off world when the planet blew up, right? I mean, everyone couldn't have been home at the time.
I mean, I guess so. So what's your point?
I wonder what happened to those people. What was it like when they found out the death star had destroyed the planet?
Hmm, that's a good point. I mean, it's not like having a flight cancelled.
That's one horrible day at the space station. "Sir, your flight is cancelled, because, um, I don't know how to say this, but Alderaan is gone."
I feel a strange disturbance in the force...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Star Wars: Rogue One Movie.
I found the film a good story and a really great use of technology?
What do you mean by real world?
I mean using body doubles and CGI to recreate characters such as Tarkin and young Leia.
That's interesting.    What about the story of the temple?
The temple is still kind of a mystery.    I am interested to learn about the crystals.
What is known about them from the other movies?
Khyber Crystals are known to power lightsabers and the Death Star.
Wow!     So there is no real explanation of how they relate to the Force?
No, we will have to wait to learn that information.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite character in The Force Awakens?
General Hux!
Wait, who's that?
He's the red-haired general who's in charge of the Nights of Ren. He runs the Starkiller Base.
Oh, the shouty one who acts like a dictator.
Yeah, he gets pretty angry, but he has a really interesting backstory.
Oh, okay! Honestly, I was really excited to see Finn!
Finn is so fantastic! Honestly, he will make the whole series so much more emotional.
How come?
Since we can love a character who used to be a Stormtrooper, we can see that every Stormtrooper has the potential to be a person that we care about. So it's hard to see them get shot down, even if they have to be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Yoda as a character?
I didn't, not as much as some do.
Why not?
He was irritating and took up a lot of time.
He was irritating on purpose, though, in order to train Luke.
Why couldn't he have just introduced himself?
He didn't introduce himself so he could judge Luke's reaction.
He acted foolish.
But it was an act. He had great wisdom, like rejecting the title of a "great warrior."
I spuppose he did come off as wise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Empire Strikes Back is, in many ways, even better than Star Wars.
I think that's because the filmmakers take the time to explore the characters. In the first film, they were more like archetypes.
The psychological examination Luke goes through - from Yoda, but also from his own perspective - was very intriguing.
He had to confront that he had a dark side that he needed to control. That was a major realization for him.
And it sets up the big reveal at the end that he is, in fact, the son Darth Vader, the epitome of evil.
I saw the film for the first time with my sister, and she was so shocked by that revelation that she refused to believe it at first. She was so mad!
But it's such a great mythic element to the trilogy. It shows just how vulnerable Luke is to being seduced by the Dark Side of the Force.
The other character study is Leia coming to terms that she is falling in love with a scoundrel. She's so frustrated at herself!
Han Solo doesn't evolve that much in Empire - his big evolution came in Star Wars when he came down on the side of the rebels.
But Leia, this totally moral upstanding princess and stateswoman, has a lot of self-learning to do when she falls for Han.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who would win in a fight darth vader or darth maul?
Darth Vader for sure!
I don't know. Darth Maul is one strong sith.
Maul may have a two sided light saber but that doesn't even begin to compare to the power of darth vader.
So you think Darth Vader is the ultimate power of the dark side?
Yes, how can you not agree?
Well what about the emperor dosen't he have more power than darth vader?
I don't think so at all. I think he is in a higher position to a degree, but darth vader is the stronger power hands down.
Maybe not sure 100%. I would have liked to see those two fight it out.
I still think Vader rules all. Would be neat to see a vader versus maul then winner versus the emperor fight scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you like about Rogue One?
Probably Baze's gun to be honest. That thing was incredible.
Yeah it had no kick and was a straight shooter.
Yeah I'm surprised they didn't use it more often.
My favorite part was the theory that Baze and Chirrut
What's the theory?
Well apparently some people speculate that they are actually in a relationship.
Yeah their mannerisms suggested that they were very close or more than close friends.
Yeah in an interview the director said the Star Wars universe is very open and there are many different types of people.
I'm glad that they're progressive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So how excited are you for the new Star Wars movie the Last Jedi?
On a scale of one to ten I'm a twenty five!
Lol me too. I really want to see more from Luke Skywalker.
Exactly, and how and why Rey has the force and why she is so strong with it.
I have a theory about that.
And what is that?
Ok, Rey is actually Luke's long lost daughter!!
Yes! That makes so much sense on why she is so strong with the force.
I can't wait too see if that's true or not.
Same here. And I'm curious how they are going to spin the story as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the old Star War movies?
Yes I did, I liked them a lot.
Which one is your favorite?
I cant remember the episode but I like the one with Boba Fett appeared.
Oh I think thats in Return of the Jedi.
What about you which one did you liked the most?
I liked episode 6, that movie changed my childhood forever.
Yeah I remember the fight with Darth Vader, that was epic.
Yeah it was I love old Star War movies.
I also love them, I think they have a lot more flavour than the new ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which one of the Star Wars Movies is your favorite?
I really loved the new "Rogue One" movie.
I really liked that one, too. It seemed closer in tone to the original movies.
There weren't a lot of politics and superfluous stories like in episodes I-III.
Those weren't bad, but they just weren't like the originals. I know that most people prefer "Empire," but I'll always be a big fan of "Return of the Jedi."
Really, what do you like most about it?
I love the final battle scene outside of Endor and I think that the final confrontation between Luke and Vader is really dramatic and meaningful.
I see you're point. I'm an "Empire" guy myself, but "ROTJ" did have some great moments.
What do you like most about "Empire"?
I like how it puts the heroes' backs to the wall. It places them in really difficult situations and shows their vulnerabilities.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
I really like Yoda.
He is really cool.  That fight with him and Count Dooku was so awesome because you finally see how powerful he is.
I wish there were more characters like him in the Star Wars universe. It seems like a lot of the characters are humanoid and not enough aliens.
That's true.  You'd think in the whole big galaxy humans would be kind of a blip in the radar but Lucas had mostly humans.
He used a lot of great practical effects though in 4,5, and 6 I heard.
I heard he gave kept his franchising rights like for the toys and stuff and everyone thought he was crazy.
I bet they don't think that now do they?
Yeah, he made millions from all that stuff then sold it to Disney for even more money.
I hope Disney keeps on making good Star Wars movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Degoba Yoda's home planet?
I'm not sure.
I just wonder where he came from.
Me too.
Where are the other Yodas?
Maybe he outlived them all....
Ha! Well he was 900.
Old fella....
I figure he either came from Degoba, or just went there to hide.
Awesome hiding spot!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like The Phantom Menace?
Nah, it was pretty campy
I thought it was pretty good actually
What? Are you crazy?
No, I thought it had some really cool effects
I thought they looked pretty silly
Plus I liked learning about a young Darth Vader
Well his name was Anakin Skywalker at first
Yeah I know, but he did become Darth Vader eventually
Umm, yes I understand
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One yet?
No, I haven't.
Oh man, you gotta see it!
I know, I'm really slacking.
I think it's my favorite Star Wars now.
Really! That's pretty high praise.
Well I definitely like it better than any of the prequels, and also the Force Awakens.
But better than Empire?
Maybe. I've watched that one so many times, and Rogue One was the most exciting film I've scene since I don't know when.
Wow. Well I'll definitely have to move that one to the top of my list of movies to see next.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Star Wars prequel trilogy? To me, it was disappointing
I had a similar first impression, but I've seen them a few times now, and I have to admit they're a lot of fun.
But there are some glaring flaws. How about Jar Jar - isn't he annoying?
Yes, he is, but you have to look at the big picture. Lucas obviously included him for a bit of humor.
That's the problem, though. He's not funny - he's just annoying.
Jar Jar aside, some of the characters are very compelling. Qui Gone Jin, for example, played by Liam Neisen, is amazing.
I have to agree with you there. He's a good example of a courageous, strong-willed Jedi. And Darth Maul is a terrific villian too.
Yeah, how about the fight between the two Jedi and Darth maul with the double light saber? There's nothing like it.
That's true. It ranks among the best ever Star Wars combat scenes. But Haydn Christianson was miscast as Anakin Skywalker.
There I agree with you. They could have chosen a better actor for that part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever like the ewoks in Return of the Jedi?
I did as a kid, but I think they're pretty lame as an adult.
Yeah, I thought they were kind of fun when I was younger
They played that annoying song at the end of the movie
Well, that was kind of fun. Besides they just destroyed the evil empire.
They also almost killed Luke, Han and Chewie
Yeah, but then Luke made C-3PO fly.
Yeah, and that freaked them out.
They thought he was a god.
Yeah, because he was all gold.

What is your favorite Star Wars planet?
The one the Jedi Council was on.
Oh. The "city world"?
Yeah. I can't remeber what it was called....You?
I like endor?
The forrest planet?
Yeah, the Ewok home world.
How bout next favorite?
Probably Degoba.
You really like shrubery!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Episode 7 was the Han movie.
Right. And Episode 8 should be the Luke movie.
Episode 9 was supposed to be the Leia movie.
Such a bummer Carrie Fisher won't be around for it.
I know. But it's better not at all than CGI like on Rogue One.
I thought she looked fine in that.
She did, but it wasn't just her. It was another actress with her face.
She looked better than Tarkin did.
I appreciated that they were tying the film to Episode IV. Tarkin was a mistake though.
The technology isn't there yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your personal favorite Star Wars character?
Me? I'd probably go with Darth Maul.
Why is that? I've always found him to be a bit bland.
I just really like the way he looks. He looks like such a cool character is all.
I guess so.
Enough about me, though. Who's yours?
Mine's Luke Skywalker. He easily has the most depth of any character in the series.
I'm actually a fan of the character purely because of Mark Hamill.
He's a fantastic actor, isn't he?
That, and he's also the voice of the Joker. The best of two worlds!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think Luke has been up to all this time?
I think he pulled a Yoda and went into hiding.
Well, Yoda was disappointed in himself and that's why he went all recluse.
The next movie is called the last Jedi, so maybe he knew he was the last one and wanted to be around to teach the next generation.
"No there is another". Leia could have been a Jedi, right?
Maybe, but she never was a Jedi, she doesn't have any training.
So is the last Jedi Luke? or is it Rey?
I'm not sure, I bet it could go either way, but I imagine it is probably Luke.
Technically Rey isn't a Jedi. At best she would be a youngling or a Padawin.
True, but was Luke ever made a master? Is he even allowed to take a pupil on?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Kylo Ren is a good proxy for Darth Vader?
No, he is not even a close second.
You do not like the character?
It is not that I do not like him, it is just that he is not even that bad of a bad guy.
In what way?
Well, he could have killed Rey. He was even sad killing his dad.
Anyone would be, I am sure Anakin was sad killing Obi Wan Kanobi.
He may have been, but SIth lose all their light. Vader was not sad at all.
But Vader gained remorse, so Kylo can have a bit too?
He gained it at death, at the hands of all the light Jedi in his son, Kylo is just weak. He can not even stand up to an officer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Too many people don't understand the nature of the Force.
Right. Even Disney was buying into the Light vs Dark dichotomy.
A Manichean balance is tempting, because it feels intuitively right. You don't have to delve into the Buddhist philosophy that Lucas was getting into.
I'd still prefer it if Snoke didn't talk about the Light as if it were a thing. There's the Living Force and the Unifying Force, and there's the Dark Side, which is an imbalance between them.
Maybe if Lucas didn't call it a side people would understand better.
Possibly.   Did you see The Force Awakens yet?
I have. I consider it to be inferior to the Original Trilogy and the Prequels
That's harsh.
The prequels are unfairly maligned. The make more sense if you go back and look at them.
Jar Jar Binks will never make sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, here's something interesting, I'm told there's some fans who are working on editing a re-release of the original Stars Wars movie.
Wait, you mean, A New Hope?
Yeah, but they're trying to get the version that was shown in theaters BEFORE it was retitled "Star Wars: A New Hope".  Reportedly, that subtitle was only added in later on.
But, didn't that film get release pretty much as is?
Not exactly, for instance, they had the Special Edition which added several scenes, including Han confronting Jabba and whatnot.
Oh, yeah, I remember watching that in the theaters.
Yeah, but a lot of fans prefer the original and they've been working on their own to get a cut of the film based on the original print.  I'm told it's a rather painstaking process.
Is that even legal, I wonder?
It's kind of a grey area... they're not doing it for profit, and it's not the first time a Star Wars film has been edited.  Consider, for example, the so-called Phantom Edit that came out around  in the year 2000.
Remember hearing about that... never did get to see it though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you see the Star Wars franchise ending
They have no movies in the pipeline passed the 9th edition
They could always be doing more just not in the planning phase
Yeah I think they may just retire and go out on top
That probably wont be the case.
They always do seem to bank on these movies.
I think they need all new characters
They did introduce them in the force awakens
Yeah but they are still holding onto the original cast
So you want C3PO out too? You are nuts!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So if someone who never saw Star Wars was going to watch the entire series, how should they start watching it?
Well, some die hards would say start with episode 4 and watch them in linear sequence.
Hm, that would be kind of silly. I think starting with episode One and follow it thru to episode seven.
Well now, that being the case you would have to tuck Rouge One inbetween episode Three and episode four.
True. But what about the animated Clone Wars series. Would you tuck them in somewhere as well?
That's a good question. Would you try to squeeze in the Star Wars Christmas special too?
Too funny. I guess you would have to sit down and plot out everything that is Star Wars and make a time line.
I agree. You definately have to spend a little time and work it out.
I guess "The Force" would have to be with you!
Ha ha ha, yes, it would have to be!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Rogue One.
Did you like that one?
Not bad.  I was intrigued by the Cassian Andor as a terrorist.
Who played Andor?
Diego Luna.
Wasn't the girl hot?
Felicity Jones?  She was great.
Wasn't Forest Whitaker in that?
He played one of Jyn's mentors.
He is a good actor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
Kind of, I watched them all with my husband before The Force Awakens came out.
What do you mean kind of?
Well, he found some version of the prequels online that were supposed to be better.  They cut out a lot of the stuff he told me was stupid.
Man, people really seem to not like the prequels.  I didn't think they were that bad.
What I saw wasn't bad but I don't know how different they were.  I don't like Hayden Christensen though.
I don't either.  He's not a good actor.  That was a poor choice to play Anakin.  Even Natalie Portman didn't do a great job.
I know, normally she's a great actress.  It can't have been the material though because I thought the story line was pretty good.
A lot of people say that it's too complicated with the whole thing with the Trade Federation and Senate and all that.
I didn't think so.  I understood all of that.  My favorite part was actually the fall of the Jedi Temple in the third film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
I don't have one
Really?  Why not?
I dont like star wars
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT!?
What's the big deal?
That's like saying you dont like Jesus!
I don't like Jesus
(glares at him)
....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know people misquote the like from Empire Strikes Back all the time?
Which one is that?
No, I am your father.
How do they say it wrong?
They say, Luke I am your father.
That is weird.
Yeah. A lot of people think that is the quote.
I'm not surprised. It sounds more natural.
Yes. it's just a fun fact.
There are probably way more quotes that people get wrong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch star wars?
No i havent seen them
You need to
Ive been thinking about it
They are really good
Where should i start?
From the beginning
Oh okay
The clone wars is the best though
Thank you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new star wars movie?
No, I never got around to it.
I watched it recently and was pleasantly surprised.
Really? You liked it?
Yes, it was really good.
Better than the last three? Those were awful I couldn't stand the guy who play Aniken.
Yeah me neither. This one was way better.
Maybe I'll watch it then. They're doing three again right?
Yep, the next one comes out in December.
I guess I will have to check out the new one before that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you change any cast member if you could?
I think the original actors were really perfect in the roles and brought it to what it is now.
It makes you wonder if kurt russell had been Han Solo would it have been as good?
Was he in the running for the part?
Yep he was considered.
I think harrison is so good as Han hard to imagine anyone doing it better!
Apparently harrison was brought in at  first just to feed lines to the auditioning actors.
I never heard that before.
Ya, George ended up loving his delivery to the actors and cast him in the end.
Wow! I am so glad he did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Rogue One?
I loved it! It was so sad!
I know. It was very different having Jyn and all of the other protagonists die at the end.
That made it more powerful though, because it was a realistic suicide mission.
It wasn't like some of the other movies, where the heroes should have died a million times over.
Return of the Jedi was so bad about that! At the very least, Han and Leia should have died on Endor while trying to deactivate the shield.
Yeah, even though Leia got shot, it never felt like she was in any danger.
I think that's what made it so shocking when Kylo Ren killed Han in the Force Awakens.
I definitely did not see that coming! It will be hard for Kylo Ren to redeem himself now.
Does he need to redeem himself though? In the trailer to The Last Jedi, Luke suggests that there's more to the Force than just Light and Dark.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the new Han Solo movie that's being made?
What? But I thought Han Solo died in The Force Awakens?
He did. This movie is going to focus on him as a young man and his life prior to the events of the original Star Wars
Who is going to play him in the film?
I read they cast Alden Ehrenreich
I don't think I know who that is
He's not very famous but he looks like he could be a good fit for the role
Is J.J. Abrams directing this film?
No, Ron Howard was just hired this week as the director.
Oh, great! I love Ron Howard!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what the main theme of Star Wars is, when all films are taken as a whole?
I don't, but I'm sure you'll tell me.
It's about the change. The rise and fall of governments and power.
Alright, I'm listening. Go on.
In the prequel trilogy, we have the Galactic Republic fighting against the Separatist Alliance. Who are the Separatists but proto-rebels?
But the Separatists are the bad guys?
Are they? The Republic becomes the Empire, and the Separatists are fighting what they see to be a corrupt institution.
So you're saying they become the Rebel Alliance just as the Republic becomes the Empire?
Exactly, those remnants form into part of the Rebel Alliance, just as the Imperial Remnants later become The First Order.
And the Rebellion becomes the New Republic. I guess it is all about the rise and fall of different organizations, and how one leads to another.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to hear a joke?
Sure. Whatcha got?
It's a sad tale really...
Don't tell me it's about Jaba the Hut...
No, but close. It's about Luke Skywalker.
I love Star Wars jokes.  Let her rip..
Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan go to a chinese restaurant. But Luke was having a terrible time using the chopsticks..
Don't tell me that Luke was loosing his touch?
So Obi Won made a suggestion to help his apprentise. He said, "Use the fork Luke...use the fork."
I think I just spit up a litttle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the red guards in Return of the Jedi
Yeah, who were those guys?
They were the emperors special guards.
I never saw them do much though?
There's a deleted scenes clip on youtube that shows them in action?
Really? Like fighting and stuff.
Well not a big fight, but they pull out their spears.
Interesting. I wonder why that scene was cut.
Probably to save on time and was unnecessary.
Yeah probably right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Star Wars movies?
Only a couple.
Which ones?
I saw Rogue One and The Force Awakens. I haven't seen the older ones.
I guess a lot of people weren't to psyched about seeing the prequels.
Which ones are the prequels?
The ones about Anakin Skywalker becoming Darth Vader. Those were episodes 1, 2 and 3.
How many Star Wars movies are there?
There are currently 8 Star Wars movies that have been released, but the first movie, released in 1977, was Episode Six: A New Hope.
That's confusing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite non-Jedi or Sith character in all the Star Wars movies?
I would have to say Han Solo.
Interesting, why do you favor him more than others?
Well, hes one of the most witty guys in the series, and he is loyal to his friends.
I agree about that, he always helped his friends out.
I would have to say if not for him, my favorite non-Jedi or Sith character would be Jango Fett.
Yeah, he is awesome.
He really is ruthless the way he will kill anyone.
Sometimes that's what it takes to get ahead, especially when you have no Jedi powers.
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, I've got some Star Wars trivia for you, are you up for it?
You bet I am!
Ok, where are Ewoks from?
The Forest Moon of Endor, of course!
Darn, ok, here's a super hard question...what is the name of the Ewok Princess Leia befriends?
Um, Wicket Warrick?
Oh you are too good!  Yes, Wicket Warrick is his name, what was his main job?
He is the tribe leader.
Nope, he is a scout for the village!
Well, I did know  his name, and aren't those Ewoks super cute?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite lightsaber duel?
Definitely Anakin vs. Obi-Wan
Why?
It's the most beautiful and most intense, with lots of flippy crap.
Ha, flippy crap, nice. I don't like that one.
Why not?
It's too rehearsed: fighting doesn't work that way.
I know, I know, battles should end in like 10 seconds. But this is science fantasy.
I liked Anakin and Dooku. Showed his progress and was short-and-sweet.
Obi-Wan surviving a PLATFORM falling on him was a bit ridiculous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just rewatched Rogue One last night. It's still holding up on the small screen.
Really, I thought Rogue One was a bit boring and had pacing issues.
Boring? Pacing issues? Did we watch the same movie?
Look, it takes nearly an hour for Rogue One to establish the characters and the battle was over too fast.
That's what I love about Rogue One! It takes its time to introduce the characters to the audience.
Of whom I don't care about, and half of whom I still don't remember the names.
Then you are not paying attention to the movie. I can name all the main characters and side characters in that movie.
Well prove it then. Who is the blind dude that goes all kung-fu on the storm troopers?
His name is Chirwut-Imwe and he is a disciple of the Whills. He is played by the kungfu master/actor Donnie Yen.
Amazing. I bow before your encyclopedic knowledge of all things Star Wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about star wars movies
Sounds great
Do you like them?
I love them
Thats good
Do you like them?
Yes they are really good movies
I have seen them all
Me too
I really enjoy them
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite vader scene?
to be honest, i like annakins scenes better.
okay, thats fine...but whats your favorite vader scene?
probably aganst luke.
what about in the newest movie where he slashed the guys on the ship?
that was cool and intense.
he killed every one of them.
force choked and slashed them with the saber.
he was a tyrant.
but so cool too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know I could speak Jabba-nese?
Jabba-nese?
Yeah, the language that Jabba the Hutt speaks.
Oh?  Let's hear it.
Seesaw peacha wonti Chewbacca.
Haha, what does that mean?
At last we've captured the mighty Chewbacca.
That is might impressive.  How long did it take you to memorize that?
About 40 minutes when I was 12, and for some reason I always remembered it.
Any time watching Star Wars is time well-spent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
General Leia, hands down.
Really? Why?
Because she's amazing.
How do you think they'll resolve her story?
I don't know. I'm hoping they do her justice.
It's going to be hard, though.
I agree. So who's your favorite character?
Also General Leia.
Great choice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many main people will die in the next movie?
I was so sad that Han Solo died.
I know, but it was part of the story.
I know, but the whole thing was sad.
I hated when Chewi started to wail.
Do you think they will kill the Luke character?
I think the next movie will focus on him.
I hope the next one shows why Kylo Ren went bad.
They hinted to it in the Force Awakens.
I hope it is not silly teen angst stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was reading a page of Yoda quotes from Star Wars, and I thought about how true they are today.
Yoda was so cute. What were some of the quotes?
“You must unlearn what you have learned.”
That's true. Sometimes we learn things that aren't good for us, and we have to learn to forget them.
“Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.”
That's especially true of politics and religion.
“Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future…the past. Old friends long gone.”
That's what people who believe in Heaven believe will happen to them someday.
"In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way."
That is true about how we often in life have a hard time, but using knowledge helps us figure out what to do. Yoda was pretty smart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to watch the next Star Wars movie?
What's it called?
Star Wars: The Last Jedi.
Wow that sounds so hype. I want to watch it now!
Yeah, it actually comes out this year. They're really hauling it in the production studios.
Or greedy for money. I hope they don't ruin it.
Well the first two were pretty solid, and set up the third one pretty well.
See that's the thing. There's so much setup they could ruin it.
True. But I'm still going.
Oh yeah same. Let's go together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't think the Empire is really the bad guys in Star Wars. What do you think?
What do you mean?
Well, really if you think about it. The jedis are really the bad guys.
Why would you say that?
The main reason is that they will take a child that they think is strong with the force and make them become a jedi.
Eeeek, I never thought about that. That is kind of messed up but that still doesn't make the Empire good guys.
It does if the Empire is trying to stop what the jedis are doing.
Hmmm, but what about the Sith? Aren't they bad?
Well, Darth Vader was a Sith. He was just reuniting his family and following his beliefs.
Can't blame a guy for doing that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you like most about Star Wars movies?
I've seen them all and I think I like the story of young Anakin the most.
That's from Star Wars Episode I right?
Yes.  It's the fourth movie but the beginning of the series as a whole.
I remember, that's the movie with the speed pod racing.
Right.  And Anakin is the pilot of the winning pod, but I just like seeing him when he's young before he becomes Darth Vader.
I never thought of it like that.  Darth Vader was certainly a very menacing person.
I agree, that's why it was nice to see him as a young and innocent child.
Looking back, it didn't take long for him to lose that innocence either.  By Episode II he was already showing his dark side.
Definitely.  You can already see the Darth Vader in him by that point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character from the Force Awakens?
I love Rey's character.
She seems like such a hero, so I get it.
Who is your favorite character?
I love Kylo Ren.
Really? I thought he seemed whiny.
I think that's intentional, like it's going to be part of the plot.
Oh, you mean like it's supposed to be showing some sort of internal struggle, or like an actor acting like he's acting?
Yeah, it's a bit complicated but I do think it's intentional.
I guess we'll have to wait and see until the next movies come out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a big Star Wars fan?
Not really. I've only seen the first one.
I think I'm going to watch them before we go to Disney.
Oh that's a good idea. They're building new Star Wars stuff, right?
Yeah, but I don't know anything about it.
I will watch them with you!
Ok, let's start with the one with Princess Lea in the gold bikini.
It's a deal!
I'll bring copies over tonight.
I'll make some popcorn!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen Star Wars right?
Yes, of course.
Who is your favorite villain.
Tough one, but Boba Fett.
Why is that?
Well he is so mysterious and he has some awesome gadgets, he's like the outer space Batman.
That's a good point.
Plus he doesn't say much he's all action which I like.
I never really though of Boba Fett as a villain more of just muscle.
Well yes but he always is on the bad side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have to watch the Star Wars movies in order?
I'm not sure. I've only seen the first one.
I think I'm going to start from the beginning.
I can't get into the older ones. The special effects are so bad.
Maybe I should watch a new one first.
Rogue Wars was great! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
Is that your favorite?
Yes, for sure. It was really amazing.
I guess I'll start with that one. If I can't get into it, I quit!
You will love it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If it happened a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away......so where are they now?
I guess they have all passed away or something. Maybe a black hole got them.
Why didn't they visit Earth? They could travel light speed.
You have to travel much faster than light speed to get to a different galaxy within a lifetime.
Yoda probably lived long enough to make it to Earth.
Probably, but he had more important issues to deal with.
Yeah, the Senate and Emperor were a real pain in the butt weren't they?
Yes, I don't blame him for taking it easy when he retired. Why he stayed on Dagobah beats me though.
He and OB1 were basically the only jedi left. I guarantee his face was at the top of the Imperial most wanted posters.
I bet he could have kicked Boba Fett's butt back in the day. A bounty hunter ain't getting his hands on Yoda.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Rogue One?
I thought it was a pretty good movie.
It definitely filled in a lot of information that was intregal to the original movie.
I thought the action scenes were pretty good and very classic.
I thought the heroine was a lot like Rey.
I think Star Wars really likes having a strong female character.
Yes, but they do kind of seem alike, don't they?
I still thought it was neat that they CGIed Leia into the movie, despite her passing.
Do you think they will do that in the future? how will they explain her death in Episode 8?
I don't know, but Han is gone too, now. I wonder if they still would have killed him off if they had known.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are light sabers different colors?
It has something to do with the crystals.
Did they ever cover that in the movies?
I don't believe so.
How do you know then?
I think they mentioned it in the cartoons.
I never watched those.
Or perhaps the comics.
There are comics?
Indeed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not sure I'm down with the new Star Wars plot.
Why not?
It kinda paints Skywalker as a coward.
How so?
The galaxy's in trouble, and he just runs away?
He was being hunted by his Padawan!
True, but turn tail and run?
I see your point, but I'm not sure he had much of a choice....
Meaning?
Stick around and kill (or be killed) by his nephew, or leave.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Star Wars prequel trilogy?
When they were new I didn't care for them very much but over time I've come to appreciate them a bit more.
Which of the Star Wars prequels is your favorite movie?
Probably Revenge of the Sith. That's a pretty common opinion but I agree, it was the best out of the three.
Which prequel was your least favorite. Let me guess, Attack of the Clones?
That's right. I don't dislike everything about that movie but of the three, it probably has the worst dialogue and characters.
But in Attack of the Clones, it was cool seeing a young Boba Fett right?
I actually didn't like that part. What was good about Boba Fett was that he was this mysterious character and showing him as a kid takes away from that mystique.
What was the worst thing about the prequels generally?
It's a tossup between the overuse of CGI and the wooden dialogue. There's so much CGI in the prequels that they are almost cartoons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars the original movie was the best!  Do you agree or not?
I agree, that it was the best.  I remember when it came out how different and grandiose it was.
The anticipation for the Empire Strike back was huge.  Who was your favorite character?
I liked Han Solo.  He was the outside of the lines guy.  Who did you like?
I enjoyed Luke.  He was the unsung hero trying to find his way.
He did a good job and the story really revolved around him.
The comic relief per se for such a large block buster.
R2D2 was brilliant without being able to talk.  Totally understood his role and message.
C3PO was very good and they reminded me of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello.
I definitely could see that parellel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest star wars?
No why?
Because the leads are a black guy and a woman.
Really? That's progressive.
I think it sucks.
Well are you racist?
Yeah.
Well there ya go. Are you sexist?
Yes.
There ya go too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do they make a movie then come out with a prequel twenty years later?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Star Wars.
Oh yeah, I saw the three originals.
Those are the only three I've seen.
The ones after that are supposed to tell the story of what led up to those three.
Who starts a movie or a story backwards?
They made them movies just to make money off the franchise.
I like The Empire Strikes Back, it had a lot of action with Luke and Darth Vader.
Me too. I had a feeling all along that Darth Vader was Luke's father.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie is your favorite?
How do you know I like Star Wars?
Because, it is Star Wars.  You are born loving it.
You're right!  I liked Empire Strikes Back.
I would say that tops my list as well.
Which one did you like the least?
Easily the Phantom Menace.  I dislike Jar Jar Binks!
Right?  What a waste of a character.
Have you seen the theory of him being a secret Sith Lord?
I have.  Very interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest trailer for The Last Jedi?
Yeah I am so excited to see that movie.
I feel like we are finally going to figure out who Rey's parents are.
I sure hope so, but I am more interested in life without Han Solo.
Oh I know I wonder what Kylo Ren is going to do.
I have no idea, but I think he is going to have a dark storyline.
I like when they have serious conflict, so I hope that Rey and the crew battle in out with Kylo Ren.
I agree. I am excited to Finn's storyline in the Last Jedi.
I really like the new generation of characters we are getting, but I am excited to actually see more of Luke Skywalker in this one.
I love Luke Skywalker, so I feel the same.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue One: A Star Wars Story?
I did! So exciting to see another Star Wars movie on the big screen!
Did you like the new characters?
Oh yeah! Krennic was a pretty menacing guy. Very manipulative.
How did you like the surprise cameos?
The digital ones?
Yeah. Tarkin and Leia
It was awesome. I could see some flaws with the CGI of course, but it was great to see those characters.
What about those Darth Vader scenes?
I know! Awesome hearing James Earl Jones do the voice. And that last Vader scene is crazy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars movies?
Eh, the newest ones are okay, but I don't really like the older ones.
Same here, the newer ones are much more entertaining. I don't care much for older movies.
My main problem with the older ones is that the special effects look silly and I can't follow the story easily.
I could follow the story, I just don't like how they look. The newer ones are much more attention grabbing.
Yeah, and aside from that the characters are way better now.
I agree, Rey was a good addition to the last movie. She was a good role model for young girls, I believe.
True, she exhibited a lot of strength and independence and I liked that about her.
I agree. The ending was crazy though, the Luke Skywalker thing had me so confused.
Same here, on the last scene my jaw hit the floor!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Prequels weren't that bad
you're the only person who thinks that
really? i thought natalie portman was pretty good
okay yeah, padme is whatever
what's your problem with them, then?
um...the writing? jar jar binks? the acting? padme wasn't THAT good
i thought they were funny
sure, but they were terrible. the effects were somehow worse than the originals!
i guess...
at least the force awakens wasn't a flop

What do you think of Anakin's story in Star Wars?
Oh its so traguc. I felt bad for the Skywalkers.
Mmm hmm. So do you think he was a bad guy?
To be sure, he did go to the dark side. He killed quite a bit.
But you think he's a tragic character.
Yes.  A lot of tragedies were caused by him, and in the end he was redeemed.
I'd say it was hard to see the young, promising Anakin, knowing he'd go astray.
I can see that.
Then events went full circle, and Darth Vader rebelled against the Emperor.
So in one way love ruled the day.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the storm troopers in Star Wars?
Totally awesome. I thought they were really bad dudes.
No lady storm troopers?
Not in the original three, but I think there are some in Force Awakens.
Yeah, that's right. The silver looking one.
Captain Phasma I believe.
I really liked the snow ones in Empire
Oh yeah, those ones were awesome.
Yeah, they had capes and extra accessories.
Yeah, I thought those were so cool when I was kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars movies?
They are pretty epic
What do you think are the oddest creatures?
The flying bug that was Anakin's slave master was silly
He should not have been able to fly
The cantina band were odd
There was a green creature in Jaba's palace that sang who was funny looking
The Ewoks were very strange
The tentacle creatures in Rogue One was scary
Jabba's monster was also scary
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite song from any of the Star Wars movies?
I like the Cantina song.
You mean Jabba Flow from The Force Awakens?
No. I mean from the original Star Wars movie.
Oh that song was pretty good.
Which song do you like best?
I like the Darth Vader march.
Why is that?
I think the song is very powerful just like Darth Vader is.
That makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did they reuse the Darth costume for the prequels.
I don't think so.
Why wouldn't they?
I read that the original helmet was flawed.
In what way?
Something to do with it not being semetrical.
How about the rest of the suit.
They would have had to alter it at least.
I don't see why....
Because Hayden was wearing it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite part of the Star Wars soundtrack?
I like Yoda and Leia's theme - overall The Empire Strikes Back music is the best.
Some people like the prequel music too - like Dual of the Fates from The Phantom Menace.
Yeah, that's great, as is the lightsaber dual with Darth Maul.
Yeah, that was a high point of the movie between Obi-wan and Qui-gon.
Indeed, I don't know if the lightsaber dual of that movie will ever be topped.
I wonder if Luke and Kylo will have a big shown down in The Last Jedi?
Possibly - or maybe they will save it for Episode IX.
I think Disney has their work cut out for them - so many people love Star Wars!
As long as they create a great story around Skywalker, I think it will work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first see Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope?
I saw it in 1977.
I wasn't even born then! Did you have a crush on either Han Solo or Luke Skywalker?
Neither, really.  But when I got older, I thought Harrison Ford was good looking.
I get that. But I think I would have liked Luke.
I did want to look like Princess Leia, though.
What about her appealed to you?
She was beautiful AND strong AND capable.
Yeah.  So sad that Carrie Fisher passed away, though.
Yeah. And it makes me feel old!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the ghost of Yoda will be in the next movie?
I sure hope so, that little alien is my favorite.
Mine too! I love when he is in the swamp and he has gone slightly mad.
Right? Like, if I was Like and showed up and this slightly crazy alien was supposed to help me, I'd be a little worried.
Yeah, but he couldn't leave because his ship was sunk in the mud.
I love the part where Yoda is digging through his food.
There was probably not a lot of good snacks in the swamp.
Maybe Yoda was looking for Space Doritos.
He could use the force to make them appear.
I'm pretty sure it doesn't work like that. Unless your midichorians are really off the scale.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the better obi wan kenobi?
Hands down I have to say Alec Guinness.
I do agree, but did feel ewan mcgregor was very good casting.
That he was he just can't compete with Alec.
Ya, it would be like an untrained luke against darth vader.
Ha, maybe true. I loved the training sessions with Yoda in the swamp.
That is such a good section of the film, I prefer the intro to yoda when luke has no clue it is him.
I think luke comes off as such twit and rude in that section.
I think that is the point, he has far to go on his journey and development.
True and also shows the dark side in him that was present with his father , shows his struggle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
Yes.  Im a big fan.
Me too. I like the force.
I like the light sabers.
I like how they can float objects.
I like the battles.
Whos your favorite character?
Got to be Luke.
Mine is Vader.
Hes pretty awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie do you like best?
My favorite is still the original!
Yeah, that's still a great movie.
I love the introduction of Han Solo in the cantina!
Yes, but I hate that they changed the scene in the special edition.
Absolutely. Han shot first, and that's how it should be.
It's also great to see Leia and Luke for the first time.
Yeah, Luke is so young when the first movie starts!
And it's still a great scene when the Death Star blows up.
I hold my breath every time, even though I know the good guys are going to win.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the scariest person in Star Wars?
That's such a tough question!
Just pick one person that makes your skin crawl because they are so evil
I would say the scariest person would actually be Anakin as he is burning
Why do you say that?
His eyes are so full of hate and he screams so much
Well he is burning! Of course he is screaming
But besides that, he screams "I Hate You" to the Jedi as he burns
Wasn't he yelling at Obi Wan?
Yeah, Obi Wan didnt help him as he burned
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie do you think had the best protagonist?
Isn't Anakin really the protagonist of all of them?
Well, I think he's only really the protagonist for episodes two and three.
So who's the protagonist for episode 1 then?
Qui-gon? Or else Obi-wan.
Okay. And then Luke for four, five, and six?
I think so. You can make an argument for Han in Empire though.
Han would be my favorite then.
I think Luke is the most interesting.
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always been really curious about Stormtrooper armor.
What do you mean?
Well, it seems like it's really useless.
Because they can still get shot?
I mean, yeah. What exactly does it protect against?
Maybe physical weapons? Or it's like environmental protection?
Like a robot suit?
Exactly. That sort of thing. I bet we can look this up.
It looks like only some of the guns could pierce stormtrooper armor.
Oh, that makes sense then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was Obi Wan Kenobi's Master?
Qui-Gon Jinn.
I liked him! How did he die?
Me too, he's one of my favorites. He was killed by Darth Maul.
Darth Maul is wicked cool.
Yeah, he is, when he killed Qui Gon...Obi Wan became Anakin's Master.
That was in the Phantom Menace, right?
Yeah. One of my favorites, though I liked Rogue One better.
Rogue One was awesome. Jyn was great.
Too bad she died. I like to think she and Luke would have been Rey's parents.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's so sad that Carrie Fisher died.
I know.  And so soon after her mom died.
Did you ever try the Princess Leia hairstyle?
I'm a dude.  My hair isn't long enough.
Once I went to hear the symphony orchestra and the male cellist dressed as Princess Leia.
Really?  How did he look.
He went all out.  The full jabba the hut scene bikini, ear muffs and braids.
Oh my.  Was he good on the cello?
Yeah, it was awesome.  The conductor dressed as Darth Vader and used a light saber as a baton.
Man, I wish I could have seen that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have such a soft spot for Star Wars characters.
I do, too. Yoda is my favorite.
He has a certain cuteness to him, but he's also a cool character.
He's a grand master or something like that, right?
Yeah, he is. I thought you said he was your favorite?
I know very little about the actual character. Just things I see on the internet.
Do yourself a favor and watch The Empire Strikes Back.
Isn't that his debut film?
That's right. Maybe you can learn a thing or two.
Alright. That's definitely something I can do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars villian?
I gonna have to go with Vader.
Everyone says Vader! How about next favorite?
Jabba...?
He was an excellent villian, but I'm going to go with Fett.
Boba or Jango?
Which one's which?
Hard to tell, one is a clone of the other.
Ha!
Darn Cloners
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in the universe
Huh what universe
Star wars duh
Oh well in that case i am not sure who my favorite character is
Well their is a lot of them you can choose from
Yeah it is a tad bit daunting
Well overall i like the design of the aliens the best
They are well designed
They are all unique and one of kind
That is for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to choose between c3PO and R2D2, which robot would you want?
Well, I think I'd choose R2D2.
Why?
He seems more useful for me.  I mean, I don't need a robot that speak a zillion languages.
That's true.  R2d2 is pretty handy.  Except when he shuts down for extended periods of time.
Yeah, but he only did that once.  He's not my favorite robot, just my favorite between the two.
Interesting.  Who is your favorite?
BB8, of course!
I forgot about him.  Why is he your favorite.
He's so cute and clever, and loyal!  I love his shape and attitude.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite STAR WARS character is Luke Skywalker.
I think he was in the first 3 movies and maybe more.
He was kind of like a farm boy.
Yes. Like someone from a small town.
He wanted to get away from where he was living.
Yes. But they needed him at home.
His land speeder was cool.
It was like a hot rod.
It went quick.
I wonder how fast it went.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what one of my favorite scenes was from all of the Star Wars movies was?
I don't even know how you can choose, there was so many awesome scenes in that series?
Well, one of the best, in my opinion, is the battle between Anakin and Obi Wan on Mustafar in "Revenge of the Sith."
Oh yeah, that was an great scene.
All of those choose Jedi flips and stuff over the lava was amazing!
And that scene really sets up the whole Anakin going bad thing.
Yeah, that was really sad when Obi Wan left Anakin. I always wished he had just taken him with him.
I know right. He shouldn't have left him there, with the Emperor coming and all.
It was still a cool scene though, no matter the outcome.
Yeah, makes me want to watch that one again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you believe they killed of Han Solo?
No!  That was crazy!
I know, though I hear Harrison Ford was really sick of playing the character.
So what!  He earned millions from that role and most of his recognition.
Agreed.  You think he would be more grateful for it.
Especially since Han Solo is arguable the best good guy out of that series.
Really?  More so than Luke Skywalker?
Oh yeah.  Han didnt have the Force helping him along the way.
Perhaps, but Luke is still the ultimate hero.
Well, if you think about it, Darth Vader really was...
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that place in the Star Wars movie with fun music and drinks?
You mean The Cantina?
Yeah. What episode was that in?
I believe it was Episode IV: A New Hope
I wouldn't mind going to a place like that.
I think they actually built a bar inspired by the Cantina somewhere in Hollywood
Really? We should check it out.
Perhaps. Was that your favorite movie?
I don't really have a favorite. How about you?
I like the last episode the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, which of the two new Star Wars fillms out do you like better? Force Awakens or Rogue One?
Rogue One, definitely
Why is that?
Becuase it's closer to the Stars Wars I grew up with and fills in a fairly unexplored part of the Star Wars universe.
Yeah, I mean the capture of the Second Death Star plans was expanded upon with SHadows of the Empire, but not the frist Death Star plans.
Yes, and I liked the fact that the thermal exhaust port vulnerability wasn't an oversite, but a subtle piece of sabotage.
Yeah, that was a nice touch.
Truly it was a very nice touch.
Force Awakens is still very good, though
I'm not saying it was bad, just that I liked Rogue One better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the drama surrounding the new Han Solo movie?
No I haven't. What happened?
The orignal directors left the project with only a few weeks of prodcution remaining.
Wow, why did that happen?
Apparently the directors and Lawrence Kasdan kept clashing over the direction of the film.
So now what are they going to do?
Well, the studio brought in Ron Howard to finish directing the film.
Ron Howard? I guess he would be a pretty good fit.
Yeah, he's all class, and he obviously has a proven record as a good director.
I just hope the movie turns out okay in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So here is a question for you
Yeah?
Who is your least favorite star wars character
Well i am not sure myself you
I cannot stand greedo
Why do you not like him
He is annoying and just badly designed
I mean i can agree with the design
It is just abysmal
ok it is not that bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars Character?
Han Solo is my favorite.
I agree, I really have a crush on him.
His relationship with Chewbaca is so entertaining.
I like the scenes where he is flying the Mileneum Falcon
So do I.
I was so sad when he died in The Force Awakens.
I couldn't beleve his own son killed him.
I wasn't expecting that either.
I know, I really thought he would be able to save Kylo Ren from the Dark Side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's crazy to think about the fact that Star Wars has been in theaters for pretty much every generation alive now.
Wow, I'd never thought of it that way. They really do have a long run.
And now they've got three whole trilogies underway, that's crazy!
Which trilogy is your favourite?
I mean, I can't really put the most recent one into account since they've only had one episode so far.
That's true, it's hard to compare one out of three to a full set.
I think the most recent trilogy could go somewhere, but for now the original trilogy is my favourite.
No surprise there, honestly. No one likes the prequel trilogy.
Honestly the idea behind the prequel trilogies is great, it's just that the dialogue is so poor.
Plus Anakin's so whiny. I never knew someone complaining about sand could be so annoying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you pick a Star Wars character out by home planet?
I think a few, test me?
Okay, who is home to the planet Dagobah?
That is an easy one, Yoda!
You are right. I suppose that was easy, I just love that character so much.
Yoda is awesome. Though I think he got a little cheesy in some aspects like the fights scenes in episode 2 or 3, can't recall which one.
I do know what you are referencing,I agree somewhat. I think that wholE movie was not up to par with the others though, not Yoda's fault.
You make a good point about those films at large.Can't blame one character, although jar jar comes close.
Ha, he was annoying. But the actor playing anakin was so stiff. I did not care for his performance.
It was hayden christensen, I thought he was okay. I agree slightly stiff performance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's too bad they killed off Solo.
I know. He was my favorite.
At least Chewy's still around.
They killed him off in one of the books.
What?!
Yeah, apparently the author received a lot of hate male.
And more than a few death threats, I'm sure!
Don't mess with the Wookie.
He'll tear your arms off!
Or his fans will!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Star Wars movie?
Which one?  The Force Awakens or Rouge One?
Either...?
I saw both of them.
Which one did you like more?
Well the Force Awakens was awesome and it continued the story form the original trilogy but Rouge One was an amazing back story.
Interesting.  Which would you recommend I see first?
Well, you should watch 1-6 first, then Force Awakens, then Rouge One
I have to watch ALL OF THEM over again?
Yep. Its the only way to catch everything thats going on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you watched the original series ?
Which  would  you  suggest ?
I really liked  return of the  jedi
Is that the  first one ?
No its more of the middle of  the  series  but it  fills in  alot of  holes
Thats one  with the original cast though  right
yes  and it does  show  yoda  as  just a  tad younger
Does it have  alot  of  droids in it  too
No it  focuses  on  more  R2  and  his part
So this was  all  beore  rouge one ?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you have a favorite star wars film?
Like the one I like the best?
Yeah sure.
I would say The Force Unleashed is my favorite.
Oh one of the new ones interesting.
You disagree?
I thought it was good but not my favorite.
I see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what is so cool about the Star Wars franchise?
A whole bunch of stuff makes it cool!
Yeah but it connects a bunch of generations.
What do you mean?
Well, some movies came out when my dad was a kid, and then when I was, and now when my kid grows up he will have some too.
That is pretty cool.  I still think the original ones are the best though.  Return of the Jedi is great!
The Force Awakens was pretty good too though. It felt like the originals.
It did have that same kind of quality.  Daisy Ridley was really good in it.
David Boyega was my favorite new character.
I love the idea of a stormtrooper switching sides.  And I can't wait to see what the backstory is with some of these characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars is a great movie, have you seen the new cartoons?
No! I have not seen the cartoons of the Star Wars epic.
I have the whole collection of Star Wars on DVD.
I saw Empire Strikes Back" on youtube the other day, still a great movie.
I have not seen the original Star Wars in a long time.
Did you know there is a "Star Wars" 8 coming out, I saw the trailer.
Is it coming out in 2017?
Yes!, I am going to go see it when it comes out.
Star Wars 8 is called "The Last Jedi"
I wonder if Yoda is alive to play in Star Wars 8.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, people mock Lucas for turning Star Wars into a cash cow, but the truth is I loved playing with the characters when I was little.
Oh yeah? You had the action figures?
Yeah, pretty much all of them. I could name all of the jedi characters.
Who was your favourite?
Adi Gallia, a Tholothian. She was a general in the jedi army.
Did she ever show up in the movies?
Yeah, in a few scenes. She's in the jedi council when Anakin auditions, and then she's in the Revenge of the Sith.
Cool, it must have been great to see her on the big screen!
Well, not in the third movie. She shows up in Order 66. I got to watch her die.
Wow, I bet that made that scene so much more powerful; that's rough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, have you watched star wars?
Yes I have
What did you think of the prequels?
I liked them but I hear they are not popular.
You must have seen them when you were yound it's mostly nostalgia
I rewatched them and while some of it is cringey I could see what they were going for.
What do you feel that they were going for?
Mostly a star wars with more action
that seems right on the money
you can see it in most of the advertising.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Gotta go with Boba Fett!
Why's that?
The dude has so many weapons and is such a badass!
True that!
And he's killed soooo many people!
Yea, he is quite the merc!  What's his kill count!
Ummmm...
Not sure?
No I got it!  OVER 9000!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you see the newest Star Wars movies?
There's a new Star Wars movie?
You didn't know?
I know they revamped them in the 90's but...
Yeah, there's a brand new one out!
Really? Who is in it?
Felicity Jones & Diego Luna
And what kind of film  is it? After everything happens?
No, a prequel
Oh, cool, I'll check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the new Han Solo Movie?
Yeah, it's not for a while though.
I know, I just want to see him get the Falcon.
And how he meets Chewy.  Best team in movie history.
I know, they had been together forever.
I'd like to see him and young Lando too.  I hope they do stuff together.
Yeah, looks like they were close at one point.
I wonder what tore them apart?  The Falcon maybe.
That seems more like friendly smuggler business.
We'll find out though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the Princess Leia character?
Yes, she grew on me after awhile
Yeah, I thought she was kind of annoying at first
Right, but then she got better towards the end
And then there was the whole bikini outfit
Oh yeah, a big hit with the male demographic
Unfortunately she was pretty bad in the Force Awakens
Well, Carrie Fisher has had some issues for quite awhile.
Yes, that is true. Sad she died recently.
Yes, RIP Carrie Fisher.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to talk about movies
That sounds good
Awesome
Have you watched star wars
Yes, who hasnt?
They are good arent they?
So good, i love them
Me too
Ive watched them a few times
Same
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, something has been bothering me about Rey in the Force Awakens.
I really like that one, I like where they're going with the new franchise.
I like it, too, but I'm still bothered by the fact that a girl who spends her time scavenging for parts in wrecked Emperial ships conveniently know how to operate and repair the Millennium Falcon.
Well, she spent her whole life in starships, so she would have learned firsthand.
Yeah but that doesn't make her a top notch pilot that can keep up with the likes of Han Solo.
She must have learned from Unkar Plutt, the guy who stole the Millennium Falcon.
It just seems weird, the same guy who was willing to let her starve and who turned her over to the First Order also took the time to teach her how to pilot a plane?
She worked for him, it showed that her family left her with him in that flashback.
Then why was he willing to let her go hungry if she didn't give him enough parts?
Just because she was left with him doesn't mean that he's kind, but she knew that he had added a compressor so obviously he had been teaching her about the workings of a starship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Rogue One?
Yes, that was awesome.  That blind guy was the best.
I liked him a lot.  He was funny, and so was that android.
Yeah, and the speical effects for Peter Cushing's face were amazing.
Tell me about it.  I also like how it basically ended at the first scene of A New Hope.
That was awesome.  And I was glad to see Darth Vader in it, even if only for a little bit.
Yeah, when that guy came to Vader's home and he choked him.
Good one liner.
But nothing was as cool as the Vader fight scene.
I know, he just plowed through them one after another like nothing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Star Wars Story, Rogue One?
Yes, I liked it very much.
Who was your favorite character?
Jyn Erso was probably my favorite.
Who played that character?
She was played by Felicity Jones.
Oh, yes. I thought she did a great job.
She did. I feel she made the character believable.
I agree. I like to see strong women characters.
I do, too. I think it's because of the original Star Wars heroine, Princess Leia.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars bounty hunter?
I have to go with Boba Fett. He had the best outfit and the coolest gear.
Bossk was definitely the ugliest.
That dude is like half komodo dragon or something.
You think his bite is just as deadly?
I'd say so. With a mug that ugly you know his dental health is pretty bad.
Wasn't one of the bounty hunters in Empire a droid?
Yes, IG-88, a sentient droid without a master.
I think R2D2 is also a free spirit. He's always kind of just doing his own thing.
I agree, he definitely has a lot of spunk to him. He's by far my favorite droid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite Star Wars character?
I've never known too much about the films, but I always thought that Darth Vader looked like a cool character.
Not a bad choice for someone who doesn't know much.
Like I said, I always thought he looked and sounded cool.
He is a very cool character. One of the more memorable ones of the series.
I figured as much. I see his face on a lot of Star Wars products in stores.
You're talking about his masked face, right?
Yes, why? Has he ever been unmasked?
Yes, and he's hideous.
Oh. That's a new detail for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Return of the Jedi?
Yes, it was Great.
I liked that Darth Vadar was redeemed in the end.
Wasn't it a shock to find out that he was both Leia and Luke's father?
But now that Luke and Leia know they are siblings, and have family, since the rest died.
Of course, Leia also has Han.
Now Han can really be a big bother to Luke.
Do you think Han will be a good father, or still be that brash guy?
Leia should be a calming influence on him.
I bet the kids will be a handful
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so excited that the Last Jedi is coming out this year.
Me too! They've really stepped up the fight choreography in these newer movies so I'm hoping for some awesome light saber action.
Yeah, I like the fight stuff but the big thing for me is to find out what happened to make Luke Skywalker walk away from everything.
I'm not as interested in the mythology, I just want to see people bashing each other with awesome weapons.
But who could even really fight him if he's the only Jedi left.
He'll fight Kylo Ren and get revenge for him killing Han Solo in Force Awakens!
OK, number one, Jedi's don't get revenge, that leads to the dark side.  Number two, he should be able to take out Kylo Ren in about two seconds.
No way! The dark side makes you more powerful, that's how two Sith were able to cause a whole legion of Jedi trouble.
Kylo Ren is a big whiny woos who just sits around and complains.  Luke Skywalker trained with Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda, he'll destroy Kylo Ren while he's crying about how hard it is to pull against the light.
What about Supreme Leader Snoke?  He's going to complete Kylo's training and then there will be an epic battle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Yoda!
Why him?
He's green
annndd?
Idk.. I like the color green
Oh, I see...
Do i need more of a reason?
I guess not..
This just got awkward!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of BB8? In the new Star Wars films?
I thought he was a cute little character.
Do you think they built him well, his plot lines I mean.
He is no R2-D2, but I think he played his part, to an extent.
Do you think he will be as important as R2 in the future?
I do not think so,  I mean come on even then R2 had the rest of the map.
Yes, but bb8 had some too.
Yes, maybe he will be the new cute R2D2.
Like a ewok, only a robot.
Yes, speaking of how about how ewoks are just mini wookies?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the actor that played Obi-Wan in A New Hope?
Sir Alec Guinness of course. A brilliant actor who was in like a 100 movies.
Who played Darth Vader? Any clue?
No dude, it would have been cool it was actually James Earl Jones. Man he has the best voice.
David Prowse was his name. He too was in a bunch of films and TV shows.
I do know who played R2D2 though.
Me too, it was Kenny Baker. He was in that movie Time Bandits also.
Who played Chewbacca? I know.
Why Peter Mayhew of course, and he really is a big dude. He's easily over 7 feet tall.
Man those Wookies are big. I bet they have knee and hip issues when they get older.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember in Empire when the Millennium Falcon was flying through the asteroids field?
Yeah, that was pretty intense. The odds were not good.
Well according to C-3PO
Yeah, but Han never cares about the odds
And remember they flew into that hole
Well it turned out to be a massive worm hole
Yeah, the "walls were collapsing"
But they turned out to be the jaws of some massive space creature.
And then the Empire was using those bomber TIEs to try and weed them out.
Oh yeah, those were pretty cool. Vader really wanted that ship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to the next Star Wars movie?
You bet! I thought Force Awakens was a fantastic start to the new trilogy.
It was much better than the movies from Episodes 1-3.
Indeed. I don't think they were that bad, but they just seemed to be lacking.
Yeah, they did tell a story that you kind of wanted from a Star Wars movie, but most of the characters seemed flat.
I think they tried a bit too hard, though Natalie Portman was good as Queen Amadala
She was fantastic, Rey from Force Awakens kind of reminds me of her a bit.
They really do look similar.
I'm definitely looking forward to Luke Skywalker and Rey's interactions in the next film.
I definitely can't wait for it to come out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know some of the influences George Lucas had when he wrote and directed Star Wars?
Well, I know that Lucas went to USC film school, right?
Yeah, he was part of that generation of directors who were first and foremost movie fans.
And got exposed to a lot of art cinema, Kurosawa, or example...
And you see that in Darth Vader and Obi-Wan's duel, and R2-D2 and C-3PO wandering around.
Yes, it was in the HIdden Fortress, that Kurosawa film, with the comic duo who wandered on and offscreen a lot.
So, how much influence do you think Flash Gordon had on Star Wars?
Well, if you watch those serials from the 1930s, you can see they pioneered the opening crawl.
And there's that scene of Luke and Leia swinging across that chasm on the Death Star.
Lucas was definitely a guy who loved movies, and you can see that in Star Wars!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the character Captain Phasma?
Yes!  She should have had more screen time in The Force Awakens.
Yeah, hopefully she will remove her helmet at some point in The Last Jedi.
I think some great actions scenes with her, Rey, and Kylo would be great in the next movie.
I often wonder if Luke Skywalker is doing to die sometime in the next two movies.
Yes, that's a possibility to bringing balance to The Force.
Supposedly Rey is going to be a Grey Jedi.
Yes, I think that will be really neat - or perhaps Kylo will be redeemd?
I just don't know - I hope they have some epic lightsaber battles during the next two movies.
Yeah, I can't wait to see Luke's green lightsaber again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Ewoks?
Not that I can recall, what are they?
They're these short, hairy woodland creatures from the movie Star Wars Episode VI.
I haven't seen that movie.
You should, I think you'd really like the forest moon of Endor.
Is that where the Ewoks live?
Yes, it is.  But it's also a place where the Empire has built a base.
That sounds dangerous.
It turns out to be quite an adventure and the Ewoks help to win the battle.
That sounds fun, I think I'll go watch that movie now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how would you have changed The Force Awakens?
Well, I would have added more of TR-8R.  Heck, maybe even made him a secondary protagonist.
What.. who's TR-8R?
Not surprised you don't know him, they never gave his name.  He's that Stormtrooper Finn confronts, who calls him a traitor, drops his blaster and shield and pulls out a baton type weapon.
Oh, yeah, I remember that scene!  That was pretty cool!
I agree, but it was waaaay too short.  The should have built that guy up a little more, maybe have something interrupt the battle and them have them fight to the death later or something.
Did he get shot or something like ten seconds within the fight?
Not sure it was even that long, but yeah.
Man, it's a bit like Darth Maul, cool villain, but little development.
Yeah, and they both died in a pretty lame fashion as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Star Wars film?
Which one?
Rouge One.
No! Have you?
Yes, it was a great film.
Was it better than the prequels?
Well, I would consider this film a prequel.
What do you mean?
This film takes place before all of the others.
Wow! What a great film concept!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What star wars movie is your favorite
I love Empire Strikes back
Me too ! I saw in in theaters
Yeah I find the plot is the best of the old films
What about the plot do you like
It has a lot of action and its fun to watch
I agree. How many times have you seen it
Geez, maybe about 10 times already
That's a lot, do you prefer the older movies
Yeah, I'm actually  not a fan on the newer movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the new Disney star wars?
It was OK I guess, but not as good as the hype.
Really I thought it was awesome, what didn't you like?
Well it was basically a retelling of the first movie.
I don't think it was a reboot, there were new characters.
Maybe not a reboot per se, but a re-marketing to a new generation of fans.
There was a bit of marketing overload for it I guess.
And the older characters just seemed shoehorned into the story.
The effects were still awesome though.
Yeah and Rey was a good character, hopefully the next one is better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Luke or Vader.
Definitely Vader.
Jabba or Ja Ja
Jabba any day.
Who is your favorite villain.
Probably Darth Maul
Do you think that Harrison Ford will make an appearance again?
He might, but as a ghost.
How does the girl use the force so well without training?
I don't know, maybe the next movie will explain it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Episode VII for the third time.  I like it more each time I watch it.
I see.  And what do you like so much about it?
I like how the movie pays a lot of homage to the original Star Wars from 1977, A New Hope.
Indeed it does.  I like that you get to see what finally happens to Luke, Han and Leia after so many years.  I always wondered.
There is also a good mix of old and new characters that keeps the story exciting.
Yes.  Is there anyone you hope to see in the next two Star Wars films, Episodes VIII and IX?
If somehow Boba Fett could show up in some scenes, I would be forever grateful.
I agree with you there.  And what do you think, at the end of the day, makes Star Wars so special?
Well, behind all the glitz and glamor and flashy CGI and marketing, there is still something profound.  There is a deep sense of human nature, what we consider heroic, and what we consider our weaknesses weaved into the films.  Luke is such a classical hero.
I think you're right.  I think that's why the movies have such an effect on all age groups and across different cultures and backgrounds.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars movies?
I like Anakin Skywalker he is my favorite.
You like the bad guys?
Yes, I liked the whole turning to the Dark Side plot.
Yes, that was interesting.
It reminds me of the human condition.
You mean the struggle between right and wrong?
Yes, I think everyone has it in them a bit.
You may be right about that.
Star Wars plays on epic themes of the struggle between good and evil.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
Cool!  Any good?
Yes, it was a blast!
Any of the old Star Wars people in it?
Yes - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill!
How did they look?
Debbie and Harrison looked great.  Mark aged.
Too bad.  Everyone survive?
No, they kill off Han Solo.
Bummer!  He was my favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the baddest bad guy in Star Wars?
Easy, Darth Vader.
Nah, he goes soft in the end
Well who do you think was the baddest?
Darth Maul. That guy was pure evil.
No way! He dies super quick in the first prequel.
Well yeah, but he was like really evil.
If that's your qualification then the Emperor was the baddest.
Oh yeah, I totally forgot about him. Yeah he's the baddest.
I'm still going with Vader.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars: Return of the Jedi character?
My favorite was Han Solo, what about you?
I really liked Princess Leia, she's really brave.
Well, I like Han Solo because he is really cool.
What is your opinion about Chewbacca?
I think he is really fluffy, I'd love to touch his fur.
Me too! Who do you think is better, C-3PO or R2-D2?
Definitely C-3PO.
Eh, I like R2-D2 better.
Well, we all have our own perspectives.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.
That is a great movie.
It was intense when Luke finds out VADER is his dad.
And we saw Vader in that chamber thing.
And it put his top on.
It was weird when he had his face mask taken off.
Yes. He looked strange.
Was that the movie that Luke's arm got cut off?
I think so.
I think he got a transplant.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first watch star wars
I started watching them when I was really young, maybe 3 years old
wow, that's very young. Why from such a young age?
My dad was a fan, and we used to watch Return of the Jedi together
Wasn't that scary as a young kid?
Actually, I loved the story in the characters
What character was your favorite?
I actually loved Darth Vador
Why did you like the villon
I loved his lightsaber skills
XXXXXXXXXXX
I gotta say, I don't think OSHA exists in the Star Wars universe.
Probably not, as it takes place "A long time ago" and in "A galaxy far, far, away."
True, but even though, I don't there's anything equivalent over there.  Think about how many structures you got that are built with HUGE bottomless shafts never to them.
Yeah, like Cloud City, the Death Star.
Yeah, I know, safety violations aplenty!
Course, I don't expect some place called "The Death Star" to be the most worker environment to being with.
Yeah, that's that's true. Then they got that thing in The Phantom Menace that's built by a huge pit, with NO safety rails or anything.
Yeah, but that have those rotating force field things.
Oh, don't even get me started on how ILLOGICAL those things were.
I won't.  I know how you get.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember that Sith Lord in the STAR WARS movies?
He looked really scary.
At first he looked kind of normal.
But even when he looked normal he still was scary.
Then he got in that fight.
All that electricity came out of him.
And it aged him like hundreds of years.
He looked really old after that.
Then someone threw him over the rail I think.
I think Luke got mad and threw him over the rail.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if Carrie Fisher is going to be in the next film.
Not sure what they are going to do with her to be honest.
I hope they don't make her a CGI character.
I don't think they will.  If they do, it won't be obvious.
It's a shame that she died so young.
Very tragic.  They will honor Leia I'm sure.
They will probably use her real life death to move forward.
That's my guess as well.
Onto the future and turning the reins over to a new generation.
Very poetic of you, but probably an astute observation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars movies
Not really, I'm more of a Star Trek fan
Really? Almost everyone likes Star Wars
Nah, I thought it was too corny for my tastes
Are you crazy? They have great story lines and characters.
Really? Like Jar Jar Binks.
Well he was the exception
And ewoks?
Hey, they were great characters and cute.
Yeah, right. I beg to differ.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw The Phantom Menace.
Did you like it?
Not that much.  I did not like Jake Lloyd as young Anakin.
No complaints about Natalie Portman?
She was a great Padma Amidala.
Who played Obi-Wan?
Ewan McGregor
And his mentor?
The great Liam Neeson.
He was fun in Taken.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what an Ewok is?
From Star Wars?
Yes those ones.
Then yes I do.
Do you remember when they went up into the trees to their village like the main cast.
Yes it was in the old trilogy right?
Yes I don't recall which film though.
Yeah so what about it?
I was just thinking about how cool it looked and how it functioned as a whole their society that is.
It was pretty neat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the original trilogy was your least favorite?
Empire Strikes Back.
WHAT???
Haha, kidding. Return of the Jedi
Why? Luke redeems Vader. That was the point of the franchise.
Teddy bears beat up trained soldiers.
So?
They were there just for marketing. A character created as a toy beat trained soldiers.
The action was fun on the speeders, though.
Yeah, but to counter that, they broke into the defense because there were no security cameras!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope the original droids have more to do with episode 8.
Yeah, we need some more R2!
How about C3PO?
Never really cared much for him.
What?!
So stuck up and British!
Come on!
That's just how I feel.
Do you like BB-8
Yeah, he's a pretty cute little bot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
It would have to be Han Solo
And why is that?
Because he was a cool friend and a cool ship, and he gets the girl.
Okay, I can seen why you like him.
WHo's your favorite character?
Darth Vader, no contest
I can probably guess why, but tell me anyway.
Because he has all those cool powers and he is just a great bad guy.
I kind of thought it was like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what are some of your favorite funny lines in Star Wars?
Well, I like that line in The Force Awakens when BB8 gives Finn a thumbs up.  I thought that was cute.
Haha.. that was a good.  Here's one of mine, it's from the first film.
Okay, lay it on me.
When they're in that control station and Han's talking on the radio to the empire guards and he's all, "We're fine here!  Everything's fine!  Situation normal!  Uh... how are you guys?"
That's is pretty funny!
What's crazy to me is I didn't even remember that line until I re-saw the film in theaters several years back.
You saw it in the theaters?
Yeah, not the original though... it was special edition.
Ahh.. we they added all those effects for no real reason.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Your dog reminds me of someone.
Who?
JarJar Binks...an alien from one of thise Star Trek movies.
"Star Wars" movies. Not "Star Trek"!
There's a difference?
Of course there's a difference! Star Trek is a fictional, futuristic space fantasy about the crew of the starship enterprise, the crew's adventures in space, the wild and wacky alien enemies, and saving the galaxy!
Are saying that Star Wars is not a futuristic fictional space adventure, that there's no space ship, no crew, no enemies or wacky villians, and no thrilling fantasy space adventures?
Oh, it has all that too.
So what's the differnce?
Different part of space..I think...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the Star Wars movie?
The one about Han Solo?
No, I mean The Last Jedi.
That's the sequel to The Force Awakens, right?
Yeah, it is.
I hear it will be even better than The Force Awakens but I don't know if I believe that.
I think it will do better than the Han Solo movie at least.
I agree, I don't think the Han Solo movie will perform well.
They don't know what people want to see.
I hope they do well on The Last Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite character from Star Wars?
Hands down I have got to say it's Luke Skywalker.
No way! Han Solo is the best.
But Luke is a Jedi, he can use the force and a light saber.  That is so much cooler.
Yeah but Han Solo has a the fastest ship in the galaxy and hangs out with a Wookie.
Luke Skywalker is the first Jedi to come around in a generation.  He can move objects with his mind.
Han Solo has that bad boy thing going for him.  Luke Skywalker is too squeaky clean for me.
He's a hero!  He dedicates his life to taking down the Empire.  Han Solo tries to cut and run every chance he gets.
Han didn't have to take on the Empire like he did in Return of the Jedi, he had his own ship, he could have just left.
That's true, but no one could have done what Luke did.  No one could have taken on the Emperor and gotten Darth Vadar to turn away from the dark side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what was your favorite Star Wars movie?
I love the original Star Wars from 1977.
Wow, that's my favorite movie as well.
I love how it establishes the universe and sets the tone for everything to come.
I actually like the characters the best.
Who's your favorite character?
I love Darth Vader because he's so deliciously evil.
I'm a Han Solo man myself.
It's too bad he died in the new movies.
It felt like a fitting end of the character to me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder where the Jedi *originally* came from.
Do you suppose that they'll answer that definitively in The Last Jedi?
I hope so!  As the last of the nine films oriented around the original Star Wars, there are a lot of questions I hope that they'll tie up!
What I'd like to see is some more force ghosts, like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker at the end of The Empire Strikes Back!
I think that title -- The Last Jedi -- is actually a teaser: I think we'll actually see Luke *re-establish* the Jedi Order.
Huh. Will Kylo Ren re-establish the Sith too, then?
No, I think we'll really see the end of the *Sith*, not the Jedi Order. I just have a lot of faith in George Lucas' positive vision.
And where does Rey fit in?
Good question!  I think when we find out where *she* came from, it will answer many questions!
I see Luke setting up a new Jedi Order, with Rey at the head of it -- wouldn't *that* be cool!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Phantom Menace?
I loved that movie, I thought it was pretty good.
What did you like the most about it?
I liked the Villain, I thought he was so cool.
I thought he was really cool as well but liked Liam Neeson the most.
He was also cool, I like the jedi action that the movi had.
Yeah, that was pretty cool as well although it had a sad endind.
How come, I remember it was sad but I watch it a long time ago.
Well I remembered that the character Liam Neeson interpreted died.
Oh yeah I remember, it was a sad scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
there is gonna be a new star wars movie coming soon
this year, right?
it is going to be called the last jedi
oh so they are speaking about luke
i wonder how old he will be now
he'll be like the new yoda
just a brilliant but super old jedi
but luke is also a human so he would die earlier
yup.
i wonder what happened to yoda actually
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite piece of tech from Star Wars?
The light saber.
Besides that!
Probably the All Terrain Armored Transport.
Which one?
The AT-AT walker.
Oh, that's what that stands for.
They look like big dogs.
That's why you like them?
No. Just an observation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could be in any Star Wars vehicle, what would you choose?
Like land or air? Either one is fine?
Yeah, whatever you want!
I would want to be in a pod racer!
Why do you say that?
They go so fast and can even fly sideways!
Would be as fast as Anakin?
Even faster! I'd be the champion!
Who would build it for you?
I'd get the Anakin's rival to make it, he had a cool one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy The Phantom Menace?
I liked Obi Wan and Watto the best.
Did you like Jar Jar?
He was very funny.
Did you like the end fight with Darth Maul?
Yes. That as epic.
Did you like Queen Amidala?
I liked her costumes. They were nice.
Do you know who played her?
Natalie Portman
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Han Solo dying in the Force Awakens movie?
It really saddened me to no end. I mean, he was a true Star Wars icon. And that fact that his own son Kylo dealt the killing blow.
I really teared up on that scene especially because of Chewbacca. To lose his best friend that way.
That must have hurt the wookie a great deal. Then again, Leia seemed devastated.
Even though Carrie Fischer moved on to a better place, I do hope that the image of Leia continues to go on in the Last Jedi. After what happened to Han, I just can't bear to see Leia go as well.
If Leia does continue on though the movies, do you think her son Kylo will do something to her?
what do you mean 'do something' to her?
Like harm his mother in some way, or even kill her off like he did how father?
I would have to say no. I think that Kylo might have more of bond with his mother. And i believe she felt Kylos 'Goodness' through the force that linked them, this is how she knew he could be saved.
That could be true. But, he did kill his father. so how redeemable was he after all?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you agree with what some people are saying? That The Force Awakens was nothing more than rehashing of A New Hope?
I mean clearly there are a lot of similar themes there. But overall, I think that that's exactly what fans needed.
Oh really? How so?
well we needed to wash the bad taste of the prequels out of our mouths. We needed to see some of our old favorite characters, we needed familiarity to get back on board.
I can see your point there. So you don't think they should have done anything different?
I don't think I would have changed a thing honestly. A lot of people didn't like The Force Awakens, but I thought it was great.
I can see your point on the nostalgia front. I would have tried to change the storyline though, make it different.
Have you heard how people are ragging on Kylo Ren for losing to Rey in that fight? I think people are being silly about it.
Why do you think that? I think he acted like a wimp.
Consider these facts; He took a Chewbacca blaster bolt (which we'd already seen decimate two stormtroopers earlier), survived the destruction of that temple thing, got damaged in the shoulder by Finn, engaged in two prolonged battles and still barely lost to Rey. I think that was impressive.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really thought I couldn't like any other Star Wars droids as much as R2-D2 and C-3PO but I was wrong!
Haha, which new droid are you talking about?
BB-8 of course! I loved him in "The Force Awakens" and he's one of the main reasons I'm looking forward to "The Last Jedi."
Yeah, they did a really good job with him. The dynamics of his relationship with Poe was endearing to say the least.
I know right! I was in tears when BB-8 saw Poe again for the first time after he thought he was dead.
Yeah, haha, he pushed Finn out of the way and there was no stopping him from reaching Poe!
That was so cool, one of my favorite scenes in that movie.
It's amazing how much personality and depth they gave his characters, especially when he doesn't even speak.
Yeah, reminds me of R2-D2, just speaks in random beeps, but still so lovable.
Wish I had a robot like that in real life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Gotta go with Boba Fett
Any reason why?
He kills people
So does anyone on the Dark side?
Yea, but he kills for money
So why is that good?
I want to be like him
That's disturbing..
(grins manicly)
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Star Wars, let's say that the Confederacy wins the Clone Wars? What changes?
I don't think they could've. They were designed from the start to lose.
Well, let's say that Sidious' plans go south, and he has to have the Seppies legitimately win the war as his backup. What's different?
In that scenario Sidious has to rule from the shadows instead of being the true ruler. Count Dooku is the head of the state as far as anyone knows.
And what about the Rebellion? Does that happen?
Probably, as their motivations would be more or less the same. They want to restore the Republic, but the difference is they're restoring it from an outside takeover rather than an internal transformation.
And the Jedi? No Order 66, so they wouldn't be wiped out.
I imagine that Dooku would simply exile them as part of an agreement of surrender with the Republic. That's easier, and more reasonable than simply killing them all.
I guess that means no Darth Vader, and the Chosen One prophecy would be wrong.
I think the prophecy would still come true, and the Sith would be destroyed. It would just happen differently than what we saw in the films.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why are people always making fun of the Stormtroopers in the movies?
What do you mean?
Like in the original movies, about them not being able to shoot and hit anyone.
Well, you have to admit, they destroy more walls than they actually hit anyone.
True, but you do have to remember that they were trying to capture Han, Leia and Luke.
They were?
Yes. They were trying to recapture them to get the plans back from them, and also to find out where the rebel base was.
Why would they want the plans back?
Because the trio hadn't delivered the plans to the rebels yet. Without the plans, there is no attack on the Deathstar.
Ok, so maybe the stormtroopers were better shots than people give them credit for.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Force.... is it a religion woth a power or do people who blieve in it so much get power.
What do you mean?
Well, is the power of The Force like mutants in X-Men, Telekenisis or something.
Possibly. What made you think of that?
Well, in Episode one, Anikin's metachlorins levels were off the chart. So is accessing the force a biologicial thing?
I never thought of it that way.
That being the case, only certain people can harnase the force, not everyone.
So that would mean.....
It would mean it's not a "Religion" but more like a mutation, like in X-Men.
Wow, a interesting theory.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why was Poe Dameron so absent in The Force Awakens?
What do you mean?
He shows up early on, and then when Finn escapes, and then disappears until near the end of the movie!
He comes back in the battle at Maz Kanata's place, and then at Starkiller Base.
He shows up for a few minutes each time, though. He didn't get enough screentime.
J J Abrams spared the character, actually. He was originally supposed to be killed.
So he wasn't intended to be a main character?
Apparently not. I'm glad he is, though.
Why?
Because a third protagonist mirrors the Han, Luke, and Leia trifecta of the original series. It fits thematically.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What color was Luke's lightsaber in Return of the Jedi?
It was a green lightsaber.
What happened to Luke's blue lightsaber?
He lost it in Empire Strikes Back when Vader cut his hand off.
Where did Vader cut off Luke's hand?
It happened at the cloud city of Bespin.
Why did Luke go to Bespin?
He wanted to save his friends, Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C3PO from the empire.
Did George Lucas direct Empire Strikes Back?
No, it was Irvin Kershner.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the most recent Star Wars Movie?
Oh, Rogue One?
What? No. The Force Awakens.
Did you not see the Rogue One?
No. When did that come out?
Last year. It was awesome.
Wait. Was it the sequel to The Force Awakens?
No... it is kind of weird I guess. It's just a story that takes place in the same universe.
So it has nothing to do with Rey, or Poe from the Force Awakens?
Nope. That sequel comes out next year on December 15th.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Star Wars, I think Princess Leia didn't like wookies at all.
Why do you think that? Everyone likes wookies because they're awesome.
At the end of A New Hope, she gave a medal to Han and Luke but Chewbaca didn't get a medal. Chewbaca had a big part in destroying the Death Star but no medal.
That's true. I always wondered why Chewie didn't get a medal. He was even standing next to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker at the ceremony.
Also in The Force Awakens when Rey and Chewbaca come back after Han Solo's death, Leia gives Rey a hug but not Chewbaca.
That's interesting. Rey just met Han and didn't know him well but Chewbaca and been Han's best friend and partner for many years.
Exactly. Chewie was probably very upset over Han's death and Leia should know that but she just ignored Chewbaca and consoled Rey.
It's possible that wookies have a different culture and express grief different than humans. Maybe hugging him would not be the correct thing to do.
That still doesn't explain why he didn't get a medal in A New Hope.
Poor Chewie. I hope that him and Rey can become great friends and adventure partners.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Hayden Christensen's performance as Anakin?
I really did not like it, although it could be due to the script itself.
I agree.  While he may not have been the best actor, the writing did not help.
While we're on the subject, who do you think was the best actor?
I actually think the best actor may have been Ian McDiarmid.
Who did he play?
He was the one who portrayed Emperor Palpatine in the prequel series.
Any scenes come to mind in particular?
I think Ian McDiarmid's scene in 'Revenge of the Sith' inside the theater, when he manipulates Anakin was so well acted.
That was a good scene.  A very haunting performance indeed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Ewoks!
Really, I never liked them. They look like teddy bears. They ruined Return of the Jedi.
No, they didn't. They were awesome!
Awesome for cute little teddy bears, you mean.
That's not fair. Chewbacca is cute too.
Chewie would hurt you for even suggesting that.
I really don't see how you can think Chewbacca is tough, but ewoks are teddy bears.
Ewoks are so small and they speak gibberish.
Right, because everyone can understand Chewbacca.
Everyone in the movies, seems to do okay. Ewoks, are primitive teddy bears. You won't change my mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I understand that you're not a fan of the Star Wars prequel trilogy.
That is correct. I hate those films with the fiery passion of a thousand burning suns.
Why, exactly? I mean, George Lucas probably thought he was creating another trilogy of masterpieces.
Hmm, why do I hate the prequel trilogy, let me count the ways. We can start with Jar Jar Binks.
I suppose you're right there. I don't know anyone who liked Jar Jar, other than the actor who voiced him.
I'm happy the dude got some work, but Jar Jar is such an embarrassment. The unmistakable resemblance to a stereotyped shuffling black servant is just deplorable.
You don't think Lucas did that on purpose, do you?
Of course not, but that summarizes what is wrong with the prequel trilogy. From the Imperial Chinese sounding bad aliens to the horribly childish and petulant characterization of Anakin, it's all about what Lucas didn't realize.
I guess this is why you should surround yourself with good people rather than yes-men.
George needed someone to hit him over the head in the story concept stage and straighten him out. Everyone would have benefited.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which do you like better - the original Star Wars or the "enhanced" version?
I'm kind of a purist when it comes to movies. The original version will always be my favorite.
Why? The special effects aren't as good, Han fired first...
I think it's because I saw the original Star Wars about 50 times in theaters.
Wow, you are a true fan.
It was my dad's favorite film, so we would all pile in the car every few weekends and go see it.
Okay, I can see why the original would be a sort of "memory movie" for you.
I see the enhanced version, and all the sweat and blood that went into on-set effects is gone, replaced by CGI.
I always thought most people would like the improved version.
Me, I don't necessarily regard the changes as "improvements." Not bad, just different from what I remember.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So be honest, before you knew they were brother and sister, did you think Luke and Leia would get together?
No, I really didn't. They always had that good friend chemistry, plus I kind of suspected something was up.
I agree. I think they seemed as though they could be close friends.
I think she ended up with the right guy in the end.
Yep. I guess she was drawn to Han's bad boy appeal.
I guess he had that, though he did plenty of good too.
I just mean that his whole attitude was kind of like that, even while doing the right thing.
I think he was a great person at heart, just a little rough around the edge.
I agree, but I can see where a couple of things go differently and he has a completely different story.
I could see him working for the Empire if a few things went differently I suppose.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen The Empire Strikes Back?
Probably, which one is that?
It's the one where, Darth Vader says, "Luke, I am your father".
Actually, that's not what he says.
Of course it is, everyone knows that line.
No, it's wrong. He says "No, I am your father."
Really?
Yep.
Well whatever, have you seen it or not?
Nope, but I read about that quote.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's your favorite star wars movie?
phantom menace
...i can safely say no one has ever given me that answer before
well, i'm happy to be the first!
right. what do you like about it so much?
the pod racing!
maybe you should start watchign NASCAr instead of star wars
wow, rude
i'm just saying. the acting was impossible to sit through. i've only seen that flick once
you're weak!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character?
Darth Vader?
Why is that?
Because he represents the ultimate character - from good to evil and back to good!
Is that really why or is it because he chokes people with the force?
Not going to lie, thats pretty cool too!
I would think that is what makes him cooler than everyone.
Well, he was voiced by James Earl Jones so thats another positive.
True, he did sound pretty awesome.
See what I mean - best character ever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Rey living in Tatooine in the beginning part of Force Awakens?
No, that was a different planet called Jakku
Oh so another desert planet in the universe
Yeah I guess there were a lot of them
I liked how it had all the old star destroyers and other space junk on the planet
Yeah, I guess there was a big battle there back in the day
I guess that makes sense, there was more than just Endor
Yeah, the Empire was pretty big
We only got to see a portion of it
Yeah, but we saw the main parts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars Movies?
Yes I do.
What is your favorite character?
I like Han Solo because he is very slick.
He brings comedic relief to the series I think.
He definitely does.
Princess Leia is one of my favorites because she is such a strong woman.
What about Luke?
Luke is sweet but is kind of a weak character in a way.
I agree with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I watched A New Hope the other day.
Me too, its strange to watch that after seeing Rogue One, give a different perspective.
I noticed how the budget is different, for example you can see the smoke and dust in the lightsaber fight.
They also kept in a few mistakes that are pretty funny.
Yes, my favorite is when the stormtroopers enter where the droids are hiding,and one of them hits his head on the ceiling.
I heard that that was not planned but they left it in anyway.
It wasn't they interview the actor who recently did that and he told what happened.
THat had to be interesting what did he say?
He was feeling sick, they had to finish the take, he tried ot rush through wasnt concentration and as a result hit his head.
Wow, amazing how many things you can learn abotu the star wars franchise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think that Luke Skywalker is going to be killed off in the new movie coming later this year?
It kind of seems like that due to the movies title.
Yeah the Last Jedi. Seems like it is possible.
I really like Luke and since we lost Han it may make me cry.
Yeah me too. But at least we get to see him more in this movie.
True. And I'm excited about Rey's Jedi training.
Yes! I can't wait to see how strong Rey is in the force.
Seeing that she was stronger the Kylo Ren then she should be interesting to watch.
This movie can't come to quickly for me.
I feel the same way, we should go see it together!
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is your favorite star wars character?
it would have to be general grevious
why him?
he has 4 arms, is very agile compared to the other jedis and sith and hes a terminator. whos yours?
mine would be yoda
why him?
he has experience, and wisdom compared to most of the jedi so most likely he also has more battle experience and he just stands out
the which version of yoda do you like more? the comics, movies, cartoons, or games
it would be the comic version of yoda. and you?
mine would be the cartoon version of general grevious
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think will happen in episode eight?
I know the Kylo Ren is coming back.
Is general Leia going to be in it since Carrie Fisher died?
Yeah.  I think I remember reading how she finished all her parts before she died.
Do you think we'll find more information about her family?
Yeah.  Maybe she is Luke's daughter.
Luke seemed really depressed in the new trailer for episode eight.
I know.  It's weird that he wants the Jedi to end.
I wonder if Luke is going to be moving around a lot.
Yeah.  He definitely is showing his age.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did Han Solo really shoot first in that cantina scene?
Yes
They went back and redid it?
Yeah. They edited it in a way where he gets shot at first.
Do you think that changes his character?
Not much
Was Jabba in the original?
No, they put him in a special edition
That is weird.
Yeah, it should have been left alone
XXXXXXXXXXX
Jar-Jar always gets a bad rep with fans.
I love him, he's funny.
I do too, he's the only reason they got off the planet.
No one takes the time to acknowledge his role in events.
He is second only to Yoda in parody voice.
Too far you have gone.
So saysa yousa betcha betcha.
Ok I'll give you that one.
I'd rather see a movie showing his background more than Hon Solo.
That is definitely too far. Hon Solo is awesome and a core character, he earned his own story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you had to pick a Star Wars film to remove from the genre, what would it be?
That is hard, I would have to say episode one.
Why is that? I like that one.
I did not like the character, ahem, Jar Jar Binks ring any bells?
I think he is underrated, he provided comic relief.
He was funny sure, but did he have to be in the movie for the plot to progress?
He did to go see the under water group.
No, Jar Jar was an outcast. They would have seen them either way.
Wow, you are right. Well, any other issues.
They focused on  a child too much, made it seem like a kid's film.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
You a fan of star wars?
Yeah I love star wars.
Same here.  Who is your favorite star wars character?
I like bobba fett.
Ah the bounty hunter right?  Why do you like him?
Always have since I was a kid.  He just looks so cool.
Yeah he does look really cool.
Agreed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Boba Fett?
Honestly I think he's overrated.
Come on! He's an amazing character.
But he barely even speaks!
Maybe I'm a sucker for the strong, silent type. You have to admit his armor was cool though.
I will give you that. What did you think of his backstory from Attack of the Clones?
It was okay, I guess. Not what I was expecting, for sure.
It would have been fun to see Boba in Revenge of the Sith, to give more backstory and develop the character.
True, but that movie was already full. Where would they have put him in?
You're right; I'm not sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How old were you when you first started watching Star Wars?
I didn't see the first one until two years ago.
Wow! I've been watching then over and over again since I was 6 years old.
My boyfriend is a real Star Wars geek. He's been educating me on the movies lately.
Oh I know he's having fun with that. You know they've been running a marathon on TNT.
Yes that's how we've been watching them. We don't actually own any of them yet.
I loved Revenge of the Sith. That's my favorite of the first three episodes.
That's mine too. I loved watching Anakin Skywalker's evolution.
Hayden Christensen did an excellent job I think, embodying Anakin.
I agree. Natalie Portman did an awersome job as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
WHat is it you like best about the Star Wars films
I think they transport you to another world
yes somewhere far beyond anything you can imagine
who are the characters you like the most
well, Luke of course, but Obie Won
who do you think is the best villin
Darth Maul
he was great and had great fighting skills
I agree, he was really professional looking
especially when half of his body was falling down the shaft
XXXXXXXXXXX
I liked the original Star Wars movies much better than the prequels.
What didn't you like about the prequels?
Well for one thing, I didn't like Jar Jar Binks as a character. He was sort of annoying.
Yeah, I thought so too, but I liked the third movie in the series, Revenge of the Sith.
I liked that one the best. I especially liked the end with the lightsaber battles and Anakin becoming Darth Vadar.
Yes, that part was pretty powerful. It was definitely cool to see how skilled Yoda was.
Yoda has always been my favorite character. I liked him from the very first time we saw him in Empire Strikes Back.
Yes, I really liked that scene where Luke first met him and thought he was just some annoying animal from that planet.
Right, and then Yoda suddenly says, "I cannot train him." And at that point you realize it is the person Luke has been looking for.
Empire Strikes Back is by far my favorite Star Trek movie, and that scene is part of the reason why.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hello
What are you up to today
Just planning a marathon
Whatcha gonna marathon
Gonna watch all the star wars movies
All of them
Yep all 8
8?
Yeah their is 8 including rogue one
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what color lightsaber is the best?
I would have to go with green
Why do you say that?
Because it was the new one unveiled by Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi
Okay, but didn't they have green ones in the prequels
Yes, but that was after Return of the Jedi
I thought they were supposed to take place before
Well, they came out after the original three
But they were prequels
I don't think they should be part of the storyline they were so bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the music from The Force Awakens?
Yes but overall is wasn't quite as memorable as the rest of the movies. It's still very good though.
What was the highlight of Episode Seven's music to you?
Rey's Theme is far and away the best of the Force Awakens score. It's beautiful and fits the movie so well.
Yeah was really good. When her character is introduce in the deserts of Jakku, the music really takes you to that place.
John Williams just an amazing composer. So many beloved movie scores from him.
The Imperial March was so amazing, it's become part of the culture and just a movie score.
Exactly, don't forget the main Star Wars theme as well. I can't imagine Star Wars without it.
He was just as important as George Lucas in bringing the Star Wars universe to the world.
Definitely. I credit both of them with creating Star Wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who shot first?  Han, or Greedo?
Han!  One hundred percent.
Didn't George Lucas edit the later versions to show Greedo shooting first?
He did, which is why it was so controversial.
Why was that controversial?
Well, Han shooting first is significant because it shows what a scoundrel he was in the beginning of the series.
I see.  So the importance stems from demonstrating his evolution as a person?
Correct.
Why did Lucas change it in the revamped editions of the movie?
The world may never know, to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which is why I keep saying, they need to remake the originals.
Oh, God, I'm going to kill you, then I'm going unfriend you on facebook, stop following you on twitter.
You're just upset, because you know I'm right.
I'm not upset because you're right. I'm upset at the thought of redoing a part of Americana. The original trilogy is a part of the American heritage. They're not just movies. Can you remake "It's a wonderful Life?"
I don't see why not.
Ok, I'm going to unfriend right now. You're not my friend any more. You are an enemy of the American people
Upset. I'm right. Rinse and repeat.
No!. You're NOT right!. You're wrong! The original trilogy is fine as they are!
Fine except for all the incongruities. That means being out of place, by the way.
I know what incongruity means! And no, these are NOT examples of incongruity.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Star Wars prequels?
Yes, I liked episode one a lot.
What about Jar Jar Binks?
I think people are too hard on him.
Why you say that/
Well, he is brave and stands up even when he is scared.
Who do you think is the Jar Jar of the new ones.
The silly comic relief?
Yes, I think BB8.
I would have to go with Finn, but he is important to the plot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite thing about The Empire Strikes Back?
There are a lot of wonderful elements to Empire, but my favorite would have to be Yoda.
He's a great character.
My love comes from Frank Oz, who acted and voiced Yoda
Oh, are you a Muppet fan?
From way back. I was thrilled to see a Muppet alumnus enter the Star Wars mythos with a great character.
It was an interesting choice to do Yoda live with a puppeteer.
I think it was brilliant. It gave Mark Hamill a real actor to play off of, and it made Yoda more real to me.
Real for a puppet, you mean.
The Muppets have been real to me forever! I loved that the greatest Jedi Master ever is a little green puppet thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I always liked the first film better than the second
Why is that?
All the actors in the first film were unknown and were really selling it
Who was your favorite character
Darth Vader, everyone loves Darth Vader
Why is that?
Because he was mysterious and bad and he didn;t make excuses for it
What was the worst thing he did?
Killing Obi Wan was the worst thing he ever did
Wow that is evil!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The special effects in Star Wars are some of the greatest in movie history!
I agree, there was a lot of new technology in them when they first came out.
The puppets in the movies are spectacular, and they looks so real in some of the scenes.
Some of Tattooine is still around, they just built it in the dessert.
Did you know that some of the sound effects are just crazy combos of everyday stuff.  Like the Tie Fighter is an elephant mixed with a car driving over wet pavement.
That is insane how they can make those sounds out of something so different.
I love the scenery in some of the planets too.  Especially the Hoth, the snow is beautiful.
That always was one of my favorite scenes to watch, the fighting and all of the action.
Even the wampa that they stuffed Luke inside was pretty cool, a little gross.
It looked so real though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite star wars movie overall?
Its an unpopular opinion but i really liked Rogue One
I actually really liked rouge one to, it was a great prequel
I did aswell, i really enjoyed jyn and cassian the casting was done very well
I know what you mean, my favorite part was the ending when they actually get on Scarif. The fighting was great
That part of the movie was definetley impressive visually aswell as other parts of the movie
I actually really liked the original star wars so the very end sequence seeing leia get the death star plans made me very happy
I know what you mean the end was so simple but so complex at the same time
Rogue one did such a good job of building its own story but being connected to to star wars at the same time
Thats why its my favorite star wars movies, great characters, action and a great story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read that the guy who did Darth Vader's voice got paid a good deal to not do much work.
Do you mean James Earl Jones?
Right.  He only made $7,500 for Star Wars.
That's still decent money for sound work.
Yeah, it only took him 2.5 hours to be done.
Uh, that's a pretty darn great hourly wage.
Yeah, but when you think about royalties and other things he missed out on, it's nothing.
I'm sure he was able to negotiate better terms going forward.
I'm sure he was, just thought it was interesting.
Someone should pay me that much!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was really surprised when Carrie Fisher died.
Me too. It was very sad.
I wonder if she will be in any of the rest of the movies.
I think they have filmed some scenes but they will have to do a lot of rewriting.
That's a shame I really liked seeing the old characters interact with the new ones.
They can still concentrate on Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.
Yes and well that's good it won't be quite the same.
The original movies were the best.
Yes I appreciate what they're trying to do but sometimes the storyline is too diluted.
I know the ones that concentrate on the senate are kind of boring.  More action less talking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what did you think of the Phantom Menace?
It was okay, but it's could've been better.
Yeah, it could've been. Did you know that's why Geroge Lucas started Star War's at Episode IV rather than I.
No, is that true?
Yes, George was afraid that Episode I wouldn't grab the audience strong enough to succeed, so he moved forawrd to Episode 4
Well, that seems to have been a smart move on his part.
Yeah, but I think part of Phantom Menace's problem was casting Anakin as a little kid.
Really, you think so?
Absolutley, when Obi-wan talks to Luke about his father, he was soupposed to have been "the best pilot in the galaxy and a cunning warrior".
Oh, I see. How could a nine year old slave kid be that?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think of the legacy of Princess Leia as a sci-fi movie character?
Well, I think we tend to forget how novel she was in the first film from 1977.
Yes, the idea that she is a princess they need to rescue, but she also knows how to fight the bad guys!
Of course. A very strong female character and not someone who sits around helpless for the whole movie.
No, not at all. And as someone who gets to watch her home planet destroyed, you feel her pain.
Yes, and understand what drives her to fight to stop the Empire.
She loses so much in that first movie, and it's really dark when you see it from her perspective.
Don't forget, Darth Vader tortures her, too.
Oh, that's right. And men always talk about how great she looks in that gold bikini in Return of the Jedi, but...
She chokes Jabba the Hutt to death! Definitely a strong heroine.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the original trilogy or the prequel movies?
I love the original trilogy best. I grew up watching A New Hope and waiting for the others to come out.
The Empire Strikes Back was awesome, including the soundtrack. I can still hum The Imperial March!
Don't forget the wampa cave, Yoda training Luke, and the lightsaber battle on Bespin.
That movie had some of the best scenes!
So do you like the original trilogy best too?
Yes, but I also love the prequel trilogy. I know some scenes were cheesy, but the arena battle in Attack of the Clones was unbeatable.
That, and the duel with Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace.
That was such an iconic scene. It made everyone who watched the movie want a double-sided lightsaber.
And they wanted a podracer after the race at the beginning of episode one too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What side of the force do you like better, dark or light?
I like the darkside better
I also do, I think the sith are cooler characters. Which sith lord would win in a duel?
I think Darth Maul would, judging by The Phantom Menace fight at the end
Do you think Kylo Ren will end up being a better sith?
He looked very weak in the Force Awakens
Yeah, but I bet in the Last Jedi he will fight Luke Skywalker and it'll be better
I don't know about that, he might have to fight Rey again
Yeah it could be a lot like the Empire Strikes Back
I hope so, but we need a Han Solo type character
XXXXXXXXXXX
There were three large battle stations in the main Star Wars movies. Which would were you the most interested in?
Let's see there was the orginal Death Star, then a rebuilt Death Star under construction, and then the Starkiller Base in The Force awakens.
Yeah, it's a common thing in the Star Wars universe. Which of those three was your favorite?
Well obviously the Starkiller Base was the most powerful but as far as which one was the most entertaining in the movies, I'm going to say the original Death Star from Episode Four.
What makes that one better than the other two?
Well I'm going more by the story and not the Death Star itself.
Personally, I would say that Starkiller Base is my favorite. It was amazing and powerful, plus the lightsaber duel between Kylo Ren and Rey took place there.
True but in the original you had Hav, Luke, Chewie, R2D2, and C3PO on their rescue mission to save Leia. That was a really good section of the movie.
You're right, that sequence is one of the more memorable ones in the Star Wars series.
That's also where Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader met again and had a duel. The first Death Star was the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like star wars movies?
Yes I do I love them
What is your favorite scene?
The battle on Hoth
What movie was that again?
That is the Empire Strikes Back
Isn't that where Luke finds out that Vader is his father?
Yes and it was shocking if you have never seen that movies.
How did he find luke?
While training with yoda Vader used the force to make Luke believe that his friends were in trouble.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's hard to believe that Star Wars is a 40-year-old franchise.
Is it really?
The original Star Wars came out in 1977. They had a 40th anniversary celebration this year.
It seems like it's such a timeless franchise.
Well, they update it when new installments come out.
That can age movies, though. The CGI in the prequel trilogy really stands out.
I hope the use of practical effects in The Force Awakens avoids that.
J J Abrams is a good filmmaker. He respects more the aesthetic of the original.
That's true. The setting's "used universe" feel is very important.
And it was definitely there in The Force Awakens, and in Rogue One.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I've seen some videos on youtube that talked about return of Anakin Skywalker in the Last Jedi
That doesn't make sense. Darth vader died.
Well, he turned into a Force Ghost, remeber?
Wait, oh yeah, you're right.
So Anakin shows up as Force Ghost in training of Rey.
I guess that could be kind cool to see.
Yeah. They even changed the end of the the return of Jedi to include footage of the new Anakin Skywalker.
Oh yeah I remember that. See, modenizing the old series is possible.
not really. That was jkust right at the end of the movie, remaking was pretty simple.
You know what still doesn't make sense? Anakin's age doesn't match the Darth Vader's when he dies in the original series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I absolutely adore Star Wars.
Me, too! But I'm only into the first three.
Do you mean Episode 1, 2 and 3? Or do you mean the original Star Wars?
I mean the original. I don't quite understand Lucas's story organization.
Well the originals really were the classics.
Exactly, before they added all those annoying characters like Jar Jar Binks.
Did you get the re-releases on DVD?
I have them, but I gotta say that I love my original VHS tapes.
Really? Why is that?
Because they have the original special effects as opposed to the new ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you imagine star wars without darth vader
That would be a horribly boring movie
I know he is the central part to the movie
Without him the movie is nothing
Pretty much it is the center piece of the whole film
yeah he is also the most famous
Sure almost everyone knows who he is
Yeah not one person does not know
He is world famous
Pretty much
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, the basic idea is to go back to Episode IV, A New Hope, and follow the implicit and expected plot points and developments, as if the other movies didn't exist in their current form.
Well, for starters, in that Universe, Luke and Leia aren't related and would probably have wound up together.
Right, because Darth Vader isn't their father and Obi Wan was telling the truth when he said that Vader killed Luke's Dad.
Which brings us to the Clone Wars, which were probably originally intended to be something entirely different.
Maybe clones of Jedi's fighting each other, or something. Or a clone workforce uprising.
The Emperor probably wasn't originally thought of as a Sith, either.
No and Vader's power was a bit more limited than one might expect, seeing that in the first movie he had to obey an order from Grand Moff Tarkin.
Yeah, Peter Cushing was awesome as Tarkin and I've always thought it was neat that both he and Christopher Lee were involved in Star Wars, given their past history together.
So, we're looking at a Star Wars Universe, where the Jedi's were probably less powerful, politically.
Their influence would have been much more of an undercurrent, with their war against the Sith manifesting in ways, less than obvious to the general populace.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars prequels?
I like them, but some things bother me.
What sort of things do you have trouble with in the films?
In particular, I dislike the character of Jar-Jar Binks.
Why do you dislike that particular alien character?
Jar-Jar acts silly, and I found the accent more than a bit racist.
What else do you dislike about the prequel trilogy?
I did not care for the way Annakin turned so quickly to the dark side.
Don't you think the emperor explained the turn well enough?
I do not feel the Emperor's evil was evident enough.       The Jedi should've noticed his rapid aging.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how the main cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher picked to be in Star Wars?
I figured there was a big cattle call. I remember that George Lucas wanted to cast unknowns for the main three roles.
There were several actors under consideration. They were put in sets of three because they complemented each other well.
So Mark, Harrison, and Carrie were a group even before they were given the gig?
That's right. It was a matter of, pick all of them or none.
It must have been such pressure for all of them.
It was down to two trios at the end, and then Lucas picked the three we all know and love.
Who were some of the actors under consideration?
Kurt Russell was being considered for Han Solo. He had that laid back sarcasm thing that Lucas was looking for.
He would have made a good Han. But Harrison, he owns the role forever now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the new Han Solo movie?
yeah, i'm already scared it's gonna suck
don't you think donald glover could save it, though?
i guess! he's a pretty good actor
the casting for han isn't bad, either.
I GUESS, but you know what i really want?
no, tell me!
a princess leia movie
oh, heck yeah! that would be cool
i want to know HER origin story, you know?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best scene in any Star Wars movie?
The best character moment is the dinner scene in Empire.
With Han and Leia on Cloud City?
Yep. Han sees Vader at the table and immediately draws his baster and stars firing.
Haha yeah, pretty good. No preamble, no witty dialogue.
Nope. Just immediately tries to ice the baddest dude in the galaxy.
Like when he shot Greedo under the table in the cantina.
RIght! And that was why the Special Edition was terrible; it changed him to shooting second.
Yeah, it really undermined Han's character.
They didn't need to! We like him *because* he's a scoundrel!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
I'm not sure.  Who all is in those
Well there's Han solo, Yoda... ummm
Ill pick Yoda!
Okay... but do you even know who he is?
Isn't he the guy all in black?
...
What?
He's short and green...
Sorry!  I didn't know!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they are going to address the whole issue that Anakin Skywalker was supposed to bring balance to the Force in The Last Jedi.
What do you mean?
I mean when Anakin Skywalker came around there were hundreds of Jedi's and two Sith.  When he became Darth Vadar all of the Jedi were massacred.
There were two Jedis left, Yoda and Obi Wan, so it was balanced then, instead of there being hundreds of good guys and only two bad guys their numbers were evened out.
But then with the advent of the Empire the dark side had effectively taken over the entire galaxy, so despite the numbers, the dark side had control of everything and so there was still no balance.
Does that really matter? And was everyone in the entire Empire evil?
I don't think it really matters if they are all working toward an evil purpose?
Was the entire purpose of the Empire evil?  Weren't they mostly just trying to bring order to the galaxy?
The galaxy was ordered before the Empire, it was held in order by the Jedi.  It just changed hands from the Jedi to the Sith, but the Sith's ultimate end is evil, so the galaxy became ruled by evil people doing evil things, so the scales went towards evil instead of a balance.
But maybe the balance is the number of people wielding the force and not the overall purpose of all the ordinary people in the galaxy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think the coolest character in Star Wars is?
I think that would be Darth Vader.
I agree. He has so much depth.
I like him in the first movie the most.
That's a good point. He is not accompanied by that overused theme.
I wonder how the idea of Vader was thought of.
I am not sure. I wonder who came up with the idea.
Well, it was probably George Lucas.
Do you think they should have made Vader turn back to the light side?
No, he should have remained evil the whole time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who shot first: Greedo or Han?
Obviously, Han shot first, no matter what George Lucas says.
I agree. What else do you think George Lucas screwed up?
I think there is too much added stuff in the Mos Eisley scenes in the redone movies.
That's true. I like the more gritty effect of the originals.
Yeah, another thing I liked from the early versions was the painted backgrounds.
Did they replace these with computer generated imagery?
I don't know for sure, but they probably did.
The Bespin Cloud City backgrounds were pretty cool, even if they looked like paintings.
Definitely. I'd like to live in Bespin Cloud City.
XXXXXXXXXXX
But you know what I think is one of THE most illogical things in the Star Wars universe?
What?
Those speeder bikes from Return of the Jedi.
Hmm.. I can see that.
I mean, think about it, you got this REAL dense forest, not a clear path in site, so what do you give your troops?  Bikes that go from zero to hundred miles and hour in a split second.
Yeah, that's not a recipe for disaster.
I know, right?  To me, you need something like that in a place with lots of open spaces like Tatooine or something.
Well, they may not work there, it might be something where the sand is always getting in the engines.
I don't think so, if they can have those pod racers from the Phantom Menace (which takes place, what seventy years ago?) they could use speeder bikes.
That's a good point.  Be faster than riding one of those giant dewback lizard things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is with all the killer moons in Star Wars?
That's no moon! It's a trap!
Exactly! Two death stars and then Starkiller base. Shouldn't they expect that by now.
I think they handled that well in The Force Awakens. Han made jokes about it.
You know, by blowing up three bases of that size the Jedi have killed more people than died on Alderaan.
I never thought about that. They were all bad people though.
Not necessarily. They were probably full of innocent droids and slaves.
Oh no! Probably maintenance workers too. I doubt the storm troopers were cooking their own meals.
Face it. Luke and the Jedi are a mass murderers with good intentions.
Wow, you just ruined Star Wars for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are so many things to like about Star Wars - I'm talking about the original.
Yes, of course, the first trilogy will always be the best.
What is one of your favorite elements of Star Wars?
I loved the soundtrack by John Williams. It was stupendous and creative and just about perfect.
I think it complemented the film very well.
I like that Williams created specific musical themes for different characters, like Leia's theme, and that goofy theme for the jawas.
And of course there was Ben Kenobi's theme. Very noble.
I bought the soundtrack and listened to it a million times. I had it memorized.
I did too. Now I can't listen to the music without seeing scenes from the film in my mind's eye.
I think that is the mark of a great soundtrack - it is forever linked to the movie it complements.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the forest chase scene in Return of the Jedi?
The one where they're riding the speeders?
Yes, that's the one.
Yeah man, that was like the coolest scene when I was a kid.
Yeah, it was Luke and Leia riding together right?
Right, and then Luke jumps onto his own speeder
But then he eventually falls off
Well jumps off, yes
And then takes out his green lightsaber
And chops off the front part of the speeder which causes him to crash.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what else needs more information?
Let me guess, you're gonna tell me.
Yes. Count Dooku.
Count Dooku falls to the dark side after QuiGon Jin dies.
And that shouldn't make sense.
Why not? maybe he was made more sensitive to Sith's tactics by his sadness
So the story, then, is what? This Jedi knight is so saddened by the death of his former apprentice, he become a sith?
Seems likely...
No it's not likely.
Well, maybe Darth Sidious used some dark force magic to turn him. Anyway, that's not that exciting. He dies anyway.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did think about Han Solo's death in the The force awakens?
To be honest I freaked out.
Why didn't you like it?
Of course I didn't like it Han is my favorite scoundrel smuggler!
Yeah dumb question I guess. Though I feel really sad that they killed him off.
I do as well, but Harrison Ford stated that he wanted his character to die in Return of the Jedi.
Really? I wonder why.
Not sure but I have to say I was so happy to see him and Chewy together again.
Totally! And the millennium falcon flying around again gave me goose bumps!
Haha, yes that scene gave me some goose bumps as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Princess Leia will be in the Last Jedi movie?
Good question. I'd be surprised since she passed away but I would love to see her included in the cast somehow. Her story feels unfinished.
yes. Especially after they killed off  Han Solo and her son Kylo Ren joined the dark side.
Yes, it feels like her story as Ren's mother and Han Solo's widow hasn't been told yet.
Maybe the'll use CGI to bring her back to life for a few scenes in the movie.
It would be wonderful if they did that. I really want to know more about her relationship with Kylo Ren and see them interact.
Another thing I would love to see is more of Rey's background. I wonder if her parents are really the ones we saw die in the movie.
There really is no reason why they wouldn't be her parents. She doesn't have to be related to Luke or Leia to posses the power of the force, does she?
I guess not. Thats a good point. Everyone wants to believe she is Luke Skywalker's daughter. But I guess that might be another movie?
Now that's a movie I'd like to see. Maybe they can fill in the gap in the timeline in future star wars movies. Either way I am already looking forward to the Last Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think happens to Carrie Fisher's character?
From what I read, CGI.
That would be cool but I Think they need to wrap it up.
In what sense?
Maybe kill her off.
Why does it have to be like that?
What other option do you have?
You could have her retire.
That does not work with the series.
Lucas could unfold another angle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know keep the footages and just add more modern touches?
if they have the green screen originals then I guess that's possible.
Why wouldn't they?
I think they're either destroyed or gets archived and gets old to a point where they become unusable.
That's an extremely short sighted thing to do.
Be that as it may, not sure if they have the original green backrgound footages.
if they don't have them, then there is no way to add modern CGI to them.
Maybe not. There is always a way. It would be so cool to see the deathstar gets blown up in a more realistic way.
Even computer science phds probably won't be able to do it without the original green background footage
They can still do it, but it just takes too long. Have to do it frame by frame, pixel by pixel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you follow Star Wars?
Yes, I love those movies!
Did you see the most recent movie?
Was that Rogue 1?
Yes that's the one. It came out in 2016.
No!  I was so busy in December that I didn't have a chance to see it.
I think it will come out on video soon.
Yeah, I haven't seen it at redbox or Netflix yet.
You should definitely check it out when you have the chance. I loved it.
Good to know!  I will check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch any of the newer Star Wars movies?
I saw The Force Awakens and Rogue One.
Which did you like better?
I liked Rogue One, The Force Awakens was too much like a remake.
I actually liked The Force Awakens much better.
It was pretty much a remake though, there was nothing new in that movie.
I will agree it was pretty much a reboot but I did not like Rogue One.
Why not?
It just seemed too perfect and it was obvious what was going to happen.
I guess we see it differently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Didn't Star Wars come out in the 80's?
Nope, 1997 to be exact.
Really?  I thought it was newer than that.
The visual effects were just that revolutionary for the time.
I disliked how they updated them on some of the newer DVD releases.
A lot of the old fans were turned off by them.
They just missed the nostalgia.
I'm fine either way.  I still have copies on VHS.
Wow, you are a true fan.
You know it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite jedi master?
My favorite jedi master is Qui Gon Jin, played by Liam Neeson.
My favorite jedi master is Mace Windu.
Yeah, it seems like all the really cool jedi end up getting killed.
I know right? I honestly couldn't believe that Mace Windu was killed because of Annakin.
It really kills me too that Qui Gon Jin was killed in the first movie, I mean come on, It's Liam Neeson.
Well, at least the legacy is about him essentially creating the most powerful jedi, even though he turned evil.
I feel like he was kind of forced to, He became a really good jedi but the council wouldn't make him a master.
Yeah, and the council didn't even want to give senator Palpatine a trial, like they should have, and Annakin was his friend.
Who could even blame Annakin for becoming a Sith Lord.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The bar is doing Star Wars trivia next week. What do you think they'll ask about?
Did Han shoot first?
Very funny. No, seriously, I want to study.
You should probably just watch the movies again.
All of them?
I mean, that makes the most sense to me.
That's a lot of time.
Well, it's a team sport, isn't it? Why don't you have each of you watch one or two.
That seems way more manageable!
I'll do it as long as I get to watch Empire.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the Force Awakens again.
Did you find anything new in it?
I was looking for clues to Ray's heritage.
Did you get any new ideas?
I think she is a Skywalker.
I do to, she has to be she had the force.
I wonder if they will tell us in the new one.
They hid the fact Vader was Luke's dad during the production.
Only to those who did not speak Dutch.
Right, his name means father in Deutch.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happens at the end of Return of the Jedi?
I think you should watch it.
Come on and tell me
Okay. Luke defeats Vader.
Is that all?
No. There is much more.
Like what?
Are you sure you want to hear?
Yes
The emperor tried to kill Luke and then Vader kills the emperor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars series?
I do but wouldn't say I am a die hard fan. Do you have a favorite character?
C3PO would have to be my favorite.
Why is he your favorite?
Well it's not just him it's his relationship with R2D2 in the first star wars. I just really like how they told it from their persective
Wasn't the first star wars based on the Akari Kurusowa film the hidden fortress.
Yes I have heard that. The fact that both where told from the lowliest of charter ie c3po and r2d2 and in the hidden fortress it was told from the perspective of two pessants
Wow I think that also it was an easy movie to making into sci fi, they replaced the samurai swords with light sabers
With such wild success from the first one they had to make it into a series.
Yeah there would haven't been a second third or seventh without that fist film having so much success.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the last time you saw a Star Wars movie?
I saw one just yesterday.
Really! What movie was it?
It was The Empire Strikes Back.
Cool! That's my favorite. Who is you favorite character?
Luke Skywalker of course!
Can't go wrong with him and his story line is great!
Who's your favorite?
I really like him but, I also really like Yoda.
Sweet!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So you know any good Star Wars trivia?
Oh, a few things yeah... for instance, you noticed in the prequels how Mace Windu's lightsaber is purple?
Yeah, that's like the only purple lightsaber we've seen in the films so far.
Well, that was Samuel L Jackson's request.  He asked Lucas if he could get a purple, but didn't find out until seeing the movie that Lucas actually granted his request.
Oh, that's pretty cool.  Hey, here's a good one... the movie The Force Awakens takes place thirty year after Return of the Jedi, right?
Uh... I guess... not too familiar with the chronology.
Well, it does.  And get this, The Force Awakens was released 32 years and 7 months after Return of the jedi.
Wow... that's pretty neat.  You got that from IMDB didn't you?
Guilty as charged.
Ha!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the one thing you remember the most about the first installment of Star Wars?
The Death Star. Always remember when Obi-Wan Kenobi said "that's no moon. "
Were you surprised when Darth Vader killed Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Yeah I was, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a Jedi master.  Nobody should have been able to beat him.
Do you think Ewan McGregor did a good job portraying Obi-Wan Kenobi?
He was okay, but Alec Guinness is the actor who will always remind me of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Do you think Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru know who Obi-Wan Kenobi was?
Probably, I imagine they tried to hide it from Luke so he wouldn't go to fight in the rebellion.
Why do you think Obi-Wan Kenobi decided to train Luke at his age? After all, Yoda said Anakin was too old when he was a small child.
Probably because Luke was the last person who could be trained to be a Jedi. He was the only one who could use the force.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Rey from the Force Awakens?
Yeah she reminds me a lot of Luke.
Really, that's interesting.
Yeah just her attitude to the whole thing.
I guess you're right, they do kind of have the same attitude so far.
Yep, I wonder if Rey will be like him in the end?
You mean turn to an evil person?
Yeah the darkside.
I doubt it, she's too sweet and innocent.
That's true but you never know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think they should do for the final stand alone movie?
I don't know, I've heard about the possibility of a Boba Fett back story.
I've also heard maybe Yoda, or one about Obi Wan Kenobi.
Kenobie or Yoda would be absolutely awesome.
As long as the bring back Ewan Mcgregor for Obi Wan.
Yes, he was awesome.  I didn't think anyone could stand up to Sir Alec Guinness but he did the job.
Great tie in, Rey turns out to be Kenobi's grand daughter, and the Obi-Wan movie is about keeping an eye on her.
Awesome idea, maybe you should get hired by Disney.
What about for a Yoda story?
Take a look back at centuries of development.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movies villain is your favorite of all time?
My favorite is Darth Vader. And yours?
I would have to agree. His story line is just so tragic and captivating.
How do you feel about Kylo Ren in comparison to Darth Vader?
I don't think Kylo Ren can compare. Darth Vader just seemed much more powerful.
I agree. Kylo Ren is more of a wannabe dark Lord, but acts more like a rebel child.
I was surprised that the child of Han and Leia turned out dark in the first place though.
Yeah, me too. You would think that he would be surrounded by some very good influences.
I guess anyone exposed to the force is vulnerable to both sides of the force though.
Yes it can definitely go both ways, and the balance is hard to keep.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
That would be A New Hope.
Why did you choose that movie?
Because it was the first one I ever saw. I saw it in the theaters as a child.
That must have been exciting?
It was so exciting. Seeing all the action from the spaceships and lightsaber battles was awesome.
Which character did you want to be?
I always wanted to be Luke Skywalker. I always wanted my own lightsaber.
Who was your favorite actor?
Harrison Ford. I thought Han Solo was the best character in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't know, ultimately I really don't think the prequels were necessary.
Why do you say that?
Well, they're all premised around Anakin turning into Darth Vader, which really isn't much of a story.  At least, not one that needed THREE movies to tell.
Yeah, but he's a pivot character in the story arc.
Ahh.. I don't really buy that.  Yeah, in Empire and Jedi he's big, but in the first film he's pretty much just a lapdog of a Grand Moff Tarkin.  He even orders Vader around like a minion in a few scenes.
Hmm.. not sure.. been awhile since I've seen the first film.
Yeah, there's a scene where Vader's choking a guy out for insulting the force and the Admiral is like, "That's enough." And Vader STOPS what he's doing.
Doesn't happen in the second film.
Well, the Admiral guy, in fact everyone on board the Death Star died, so yeah.
I think the story of Anakin's fall could have been good, they just should have handled it differently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think is the bigger franchise, Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings?
That's not even a question is it? It's obviously Star Wars.
Okay, maybe so, but I'd argue that the public knows just as many Lord of the Ring characters as they do Star Wars.
Ha, no way. Name some then.
Gandolf, Frodo, Samwise, Gollum, Legolas, Aragorn, Bilbo, and plenty more.
Sure, but in Yoda, Vader, the Emperor, Han, Luke, Chewie, Leia, R2D2, C-3P0, and even characters like Tarkin. That's just the original trilogy.
Seems close. If I add in The Hobbit there's a lot more.
And then I'd add in the prequels, the sequels, and the spin-off movies. Even characters everyone hates like Jar-Jar people still know.
Yeah, yeah, I guess it was kind of dumb to compare them.
Look, Lord of the Rings is huge, really it is. But it's no Star Wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the new Star Wars movies
yes I do
I love the way they did the cameos of Leia, Han, and Luke
Yes I think that was a great way to honor them
Although I am not thrilled that the franchise was sold to Disney
Yes it does not really seem right to me
I hope that they will stay true to the stories
There are so many stories so there is plenty to choose from
So far they have all of the cheesyness of the originals
I agree, not in a bad way just a Star Wars way
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite actor in star wars?
I really like Harrison Ford.
Oh me too.
I was very happy Han Solo returned in the Force Awakens.
He did such a great job with Han Solo.
I agree.
What  other actors do you like?
I like James Earl Jones as the voice of Vader.
He made Vader so creepy.
He definitely did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the star wars series
Awesome
You like them?
Love them
They have so much originality
They really do
I have seen all of them
Me too
They are great
Extremely
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your least favorite Star Wars character.
Jar Jar, no doubt.
He was probably the most annoying thing I've ever seen.
"Yousa thinks?"
Ha! Don't you start!
There was just no reason for him to be in the movie at all.
Except to introduce the Jedi to the Gungans.
True.
Otherwise, you're right.
Completely pointless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't think they'll use Mace Windu in Rebels.  It just seems like a waste.  They'll have to save him for the movies.
Samuel L. Jackson might be too busy being Nick Fury.
I don't think that would stop Disney.  They can just delay a MCU movie.
It would be reckless, though.  They like money more than they like cool things.
That's a good point.  But they should at least give him a comic.
The comics have even fewer readers than Rebels has viewers.
That's why they can do it.  It won't have as big an impact, but it won't be disruptive, either.
Yeah, people can always dismiss the comics.
And a Mace Windu comic would be good for testing the waters if they want to use him in Rebels.
I still think it's a bad idea, though. He had a cool death.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So there is a debate over the relationship between Wookies and Ewoks.
Yes, some say they ae related like distant cousins.
That's what i originally thought. But then i came up with a different theory.
What was that?
Well, like on Earth there are Humans and Apes, i was thinking that Wookies and Ewoks were similar.
So Wookies would be the advanced of the two.
Yes, and the Ewoks were the lesser of the two species.
Interesting. They do look similar except for the height issue.
And they are a jungle species. However we've only seen Chewbacca, no other wookies.
That is true too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you watching?
The Force Awakens.
Haven't seen it.
Come over and watch it with me, you will love it.
I don't know.
They brought back Han Solo and Chewbacca. They are riding high in the Millennium Falcon.
How about C-3PO?
Yep, and there is a new character named Rey who is super cool, reminds me of you.
A guy named Rey reminds you of me?
That's so funny! Rey is a girl!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love The Force Awakens, but it left me with so many questions?
Like who are Rey's parents?
Yeah.  But I think she's Han and Leia's daughter.
Me too.  What other questions do you have?
The biggest one is "who is Supreme Leader Snoke"?
Right!  I wonder who he is too.
Some fans think he is someone we already met in one of the other films.
Really?  Like who?
Well, maybe a Jedi gone bad.
Well, Leia did act like she knew who he was, so that theory makes sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the way the Force Awakens played out?
Which part?
Killing Han Solo for one.
I hated that!
I know, it came so sudden.
There was no real build up.
I hated his son in the whole movie.
I know! He was too moody.
I think Leia was really good in that one though.
Very powerful, and strong. So sad that actress passed away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where in the Star Wars universe would you want to live?
Coruscant would be the coolest place. How about you?
I'd want to live on Naboo. It looks pretty.
In Coruscant, I think you'd have more opportunities and lots of people there
Many of the places are inhospitable, too hot or cold
You would want to live somewhere you could do something
You might want to go somewhere where there wasn't constant wars
You would not want to be somewhere they would destroy your planet
Coruscant seems like a good one not to blow up, but not free from war
It would be a great place to explore
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, are you going to see the new Star Wars movie this December?
You mean "Star Wars: The Last Jedi?"
Yeah, it looks really good, i think.
Yeah, I watched the trailer last month and it got me really excited about it. I hope we find out who Rey's parents are.
Do you have any theories?
Um, I'm leaning toward Luke being her dad, but I dunno. That seems too obvious.
Yeah, I read an article online about her being a Kenobi.
Really?? That sounds cool. That would make Obi Wan Kenobi her grandfather?
Something like that.
Wow, now i'm really excited to find out when the movie comes out. Let's go see it together!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new sith, Kylo Ren; in the new Star War's episode?
This is the one who is taking Darth Vader's place?
Yes, apparently Darth Vader, who ended up being Luke Skywalker's father has a following.
That's right I heard that Kylo Ren is Darth Vader's grandson in the Force Awakens.
Yes, he is the son of Han Solo, and Leia Organa.
So do you think Kylo Ren will eventually turn to the light side?
I am not to sure, the movie get's pretty dark near the end.
Does it get as dark as Episode 3 when the young jedi's are killed?
Yes, there is always something that keeps the sith going down the dark path.
I am glad that they have a new jedi to battle him, hopefully Luke take care of the sith for good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, do you think that Jar Jar is a Sith?
Why would you think he's a Sith?
There's a theory going around that he is.
What do the theory's say?
Well, if you look at his eyes, they look just like a Sith's?
You mean because they're yellow?  Go on.
And in one of the films he uses a force jump, even though he doesn't use the force.
People may be onto something.
I know, just imagine if when the new films come out he's a Sith lord!
I can't imagine peoples' reactions!  What if the annoying voice was just an act?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Darth Vader could have kicked Palpatine's butt if he wanted to.
Nah.  Force lightning would fry his suit, just like it did in Jedi.  At best, it would be a mutual kill.
Vader didn't have his saber then, and was missing one hand.  If he has his saber, he'd have been able to block it, just like Windu.
Windu knew Vaapad.  Vader doesn't.
He could have mastered Vaapad. And besides, you don't need Vaapad to block lightning, or to absorb it.
Vader couldn't have mastered Vaapad. Vaapad requires you to skirt the dark side, Vader jumped all the way in.
He could still absorb it.
He couldn't absorb it with his hands, because they're mechanical.  They'd be fried.
The force doesn't care if it's mechanical or not, he could absorb Han's blaster bolt with his hand.
The blaster bolt wasn't electricity, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You'll never guess how much Harrison Ford got paid to be in Star Wars.
I'll guess something small, like $100,000.
You're so wrong.  Think lower?
$50,000?  It couldn't have been much worse.
He was $10,000 and received no royalties?
What?  That's total madness.
Yeah, he only $1,000 a week for filming and did it for ten weeks.
He got totally ripped off.
He made up for it with the other movies and got millions for them though.
I'd be bitter that I got stiffed so much the first time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
i want to build a Star Wars model.
Which once?
The Lego Death Star.
What would you do with it?
Put it in my basement with all my other Star Wars memorabilia.
Do you have a lot?
Yes, some helmets, masks, etc.
What about a light saber?
A few of those too.
Green or Blue or Red?  Or purple?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Who is your favorite star wars person?
Like character?
Yeah.
I really like Princess Leia.
Oh interesting.
What about you?
I like Luke.
Gotcha.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star War movies?
Yes! I love them, I have a DVD collection.
Who is your favorite character? R2D2
Did you see the episode "Revenge of the Sith?
Yes! it was shocking to see Anakin Skywalker  fighting Obi-Wan.
I like the part in the movie when Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader.
Me too, did you see "Return of the Jedi?"
Yes! it was a good movie too.
I like all of the Star War movies, I went to the movies to see  them all it was great.
The Star War movies will go down in history as one of the greatest movie sagas of all time in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did George Lucas really want Spielberg to direct Return of the Jedi?
I heard he did. I heard he also wanted David Lynch to do it.
Were either of them interested?
I think so
Who directed it anyways?
Richard Marquand
I've never heard of him
He is a lesser known filmmaker
Did you enjoy that third film?
Yes. Return of the Jedi was great
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.
It's mine too! What's your favorite part?
When Han gets frozen and Leia tells him she loves him.
That part's great. My favorite is when Han is looking for Luke on Hoth.
Why is that your favorite part?
I really like how loyal Han is to Luke. It makes me happy.
Han is very loyal.
Lando isn't loyal though. He betrayed Han and his friends.
That's true, but if he didn't Leia would never had said she loved him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Star Wars fan
Oh my god, yes!
Really, do you like ALL the movies?
Well, we won't talk about those two prequels...
Those were horrible.
Weren't they?  That guy the got to play the young Darth Vadar...
Can you say "overacting"
And what about Jar-Jar Binks
Perhaps the most annoying character in Star Wars history.
Even more annoying than the cloying little Ewoks and their Christmas specials!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any favorite side antagonists in the Star Wars movies?
I think that I really like the sand people.
Oh man, they were scary.
Yes they were!
Especially their yelling.
It creeps me out to hear them make that noise.
Their outfits were so cool though.
Yes I really like the things on their heads.
I am not even sure if that is there face or a mask.
Me either! I wonder if there is something under it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the new Star Wars?
The Last Jedi?
Yes, I can not wait.
I hope Luke has a bigger part in this one.
I think he will.
He only spoke like two words in the last one.
But, it still felt like he was part of the movie.
They did talk about him a lot.
I was excited when Ray found him.
I think that was one of the best parts of the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the first Star Wars movie?
From the prequel trilogy?
Yeah, the Phantom Menace.
I did see that one, I liked the actor they chose for young Anakin.
Me too, he did a good job.
I was not a big fan of the animation though.
I kind of liked it, it would've been hard to do those racing scenes without animation.
That's true, I can't think of how they would've done it with older effects.
I think that movie was the best out of all the prequel movies.
I agree, that once was my favorite out of those three.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Obi-Wan?
In the prequels or in general?
In general.
Aside from the issues with the costume, I think he's a good character.
Cosume issues?
Why would he still be wearing Jedi robes twenty years later? Those are nomad robes. The Jedi outfit should have been different.
Oh, that's hillarious. I never noticed.  I think he did a bad job of keeping an eye on Luke.
I always thought he was just watching to make sure he didn't go nuts.
Well, in that case he did a good job.
But, he could have done more to train him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Luke Skywalker?
Kind of nerd, but ultimately turned into a pretty bad a** dude.
Yeah, he got ripped in Empire
Well I wouldn't say exactly ripped.
Well he showed of his guns while carrying Yoda in Dagoba
Yeah, that's true. Had that back pack thing to carry him.
Then he had that cool black outfit in Jedi
Oh yeah, with the black glove.
Yeah because his hand was shot in battle.
Yeah, Jabba's sand cruiser thing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Return of the Jedi.
Which version did you see?
The 1997 version.
Did you notice any differences?
The song in Jabba's palace was changed.
Wow.  What else?
Nine new members were added to the band!
It's a blur.  What else?
They got rid of Ewok Celebration at the end.
No way!  That was my favorite song in the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Bob Anderson was the Darth Vader stunt double?
Wow - his sword work was great.  Was he in the original?
Bob Anderson was in Empire and Return of the Jedi.
I really liked the lightsaber dual in The Empire Strikes Back.
It must have been hot operating the Jabba the Hut giant puppet.
Yeah, that was a lot of work, but it was great practical effects.
I read that the set was raised for Yoda on Empire so that Frank Oz could fit underneath.
And then I guess Luke Skywalker had a puppet on his back during the running sequences.
Do you know where they filmed in the original Star Wars?
I think they filmed it in Tunisia and England.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Star Wars movies?
No, I have seen the first three. How about you?
Me too. Only the first three. I tried to watch the fourth one but it just wasn't the same without Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker
Oh I know, althought Nathalie Portman as her mother looked pretty as the Queen.
Yeah from the previews she did. I can't even watch them when they come on TV. My husband likes them though.
He likes the all day marathons they have been having I bet, huh?
I'll say. I can't get him away from the TV when they come on. He sets there and watches them one after the other. I have to get up and do something else.
Not into all that sci-fi I guess.
No I think its become too computerized for me. I much prefer the older ones.
I know what you mean. But there is something to be said for a good space fight between star jets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the gender equality that the Star Wars movies promote.
Exactly, Leia gets a turn at being a heroine alongside Luke and Han Solo.
Then in the Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and The Revenge of the Sith, Padme is a female driving force.
Padme is a force to be reckoned with!
Agreed. And I loved Natalie Portman cast in that role.
She did a great job.
I look forward to the new Star Wars movie coming out in December 2017.
I'm sure there will be some powerful female characters that are featured.
I know Rey will resume her role and portray a strong female character.
As only George Lucas can do it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do like star wars movies?
I do, but the originals are my favorite by far.
I love the originals, george lucas is great. I did like the newest ones too. Did you not like them?
I did enjoy them, just not as much as the originals. I liked how forward the females were in the last two.
Ya , it is an interesting thing to see how differently the females are being portrayed now. I liked having the female hero.
Me too, but I worry now that it seems to be repeating itself. anything done too much gets boring.
I suppose I agree, it could get played out . But then again look how long males have been typically the lead. Decades with luke, han, darth...
True, perhaps this is just where all movies must go now to change up what has become played out. I wonder what george think of this, do you ?
I do wonder sometimes if he approves of these new disney versions. I honestly think they are much better than the ones he did in between.
Agreed, the cgi was not a good choice, and jar jar was so annoying. I am glad the star wars franchise has redeemed itself. Looking forward to the next one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard that the original movies didn't have stunt doubles.
That's probably not correct.
They may have had some, but not many due to lack of money.
What scenes did the actors have to do?
You remember the one where Luke and Leia swing across the gap?
Sure, I remember it.
That was really the actors doing it.
But I'm sure the gap wasn't bottomless.
Of course not, was only 30 feet or so, but interesting nonetheless.
I do my own stunts in real life!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Mine is Master Yoda.
What do you think of Star Wars since Disney took over?
I think they actually did a great job.
Did you like the movie Rogue One?
I like how it's explained how the plans to the Death Star were obtained.
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I would have to say the Empire Strikes back.
I would have to agree, although I can't wait for the latest movie.
Me too, I hope it's explained if Rey is Luke's daughter or not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what it would be like in them movies if they did not use light sabers
I honestly did not know
It would be quite different
I do not think it would be good
It prolly would not be good
It would prolly be awful
Definitely would not have gotten popular like it is
It would have prolly flopped
And then as we know it it would not be the same
Exactly man
XXXXXXXXXXX
I cannot stand some characters in star wars
Why
Because they are just bad
How are they bad
Well they are annoying and bad
How so
Well Greedo is so generic looking and the whole scene is just annoying
Why though
Because the answer to it is obvious
How is it obvious
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do you think the Star Wars movies are going?
I think Disney has added something to them
It seems like they will be going for a while
It is very entertaining
I'm sure they'll make some spinoffs
The Star Wars Universe is big, there's room for it
I wonder if they will go into the future in the next series or go further back
I think they would go further forward if they do a third trilogy
Maybe they will just keep changing the cast and have new Jedi
The original cast might be too old to be in those
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think the problem with Star Wars now is its getting too expansive
No way, people see those and remember every detail
I think Rey will not be able to hold up as a main character
And she might not be around for well long.
I think they need to develop and protagonist and antagonist.
And thats what she offers at the time
Is having a female lead good?
I think its progressive
So it would fit Disneys liberal agenda?
Lets not bring politics in to this.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
Of course, who does not like Star Wars?
I think it does not get enough credit for how funny it is?
Purposely or due to the fact it is sometimes silly?
The Jokes, it had great jokes in the first one.
How so?
Well, the way Luke interacts with his aunt and uncle.
The moody teen thing.
Yes, I think they play that humor well.
I like when Yoda makes jokes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think wookies have flea and lice problems?
I would definitely say so. I mean with all that fur who knows what could set up shop in there.
Do you think they use soap and shampoo to bathe, or just shampoo?
Well they are like 90% fur so I would think that soap would be somewhat useless.
What about a wookie with severe alopecia?
You mean a bald wookie or mostly bald wookie?
Exactly, they would need soap don't you think?
I'd say so but I bet their skin is sensitive so it would be like aloe vera based, very gentle and soothing soap.
Do wookies ever suffer from male pattern baldness?
Beats me. Have you ever seen a bald wookie? I haven't.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Clone Wars?
Episode two of Star Wars, yes I did.
Did you like they way they made Padme and Anakin fall in love.
I think they were already in love, at least he was, when they first met on Tatooine.
But she was so much older than him.
Not really, he was an adult by then, twenty, she was twenty four.
Wow, she did a lot by then in the movies.
She was a queen at sixteen and a senator by twenty, so yes she did.
I think she was too smart for him, all the things she did.
She was, but there was also the force at play, the danger of the dark side and the light side pushing them to one another.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the new Star Wars movie?
No I hated it
Why
I don't like the new characters at all
The original characters were in it too though
No enough. The new characters are just a play for the diversity vote
So it was not worth the wait?
No I was really disappointed.
That's a shame
Yeah I'll keep re watching the originals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is the strongest sith?
I would go with darth vader. He is the ultimate sith.
I suppose that is true.
I think darth maul is cool and pretty great but nothing compares to vader.
What about the emperor?
He is more of a figure head with great powers but vader is the stronger weapon.
Interesting take Vader as a weapon.
Well did the emperor just use him more or less?
I suppose that is a good point.
A very true fact if you ask me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your top scene with Darth Vader in all of the Star Wars movies?
I really liked his appearance in Rouge One. That was incredible.
He barely had any dialogue in that movie.
Yes but we kept hearing about what a powerful user of the dark side of The Force Darth Vader and I feel like his scene in Rogue One finally showed that off.
How about your favorite Darth Vader scene from the original trilogy?
You definitely have to go with the icon scene in Empire Strikes Back where he reveals himself to be Luke Skywalker's father. Nothing tops that scene.
That was such a good scene. On top of that, it was also right after an emotional lightsaber duel between Vader and Skywalker.
Don't forget that Luke also loses his hand in that scene.
Did you like anything about Darth Vader in the prequal movies?
Well technically he wasn't Darth Vader then, he was still Anakin Skywalker. He didn't become Darth Vader until near the end of Revenge of the Sith.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do light sabres work?
I've given this some thought, and I have not a clue!
It seems like it could be a lazer.
But then why wouldn't it go on for ever.
There must be some kind of lense the bends the light.
But then how does it come to a point.
That is a valid "point".
Ha! It seems like it would be a circle if that were the case.
True.
I guess we'll have to write Lucas a letter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Force Awakens yet?
Yea my dad and I went to see it in the theatres.
I just bought it on DVD and can't wait to see it.
What did you think when Snook was introduced?
I was confused be cause I did not know who he was.
The movie didn't explain who he was but it should be revealed in the next movie.
I think he might be a version of Darth Vader.
I thought the same thing, hopefully he will get revenge on the Jedi.
I hope not, the Jedi are good people.
I belong with the dark side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really don't think there has been a good Star Wars movie since The Empire Strikes Back.
Well, the franchise certainly peaked with the first two movies, but do not discount the impact of the 6 movies.
I suppose Rogue One was ok, but it was only ok because it was such a  departure from the Lucas Films format.
Rogue One was a departure in that the themes and structure were different, but it stayed true to the universe and source material.
But all the characters in Rogue One, like Jyn Erso, K-2SO, and Cassian Andor were some much more multi-faceted and believable that what had been churned out since Return of the Jedi.
Darth Vader was in Rogue One. He is what made Return of the Jedi and all three of the Prequels enjoyable.
I would argue with you that The Phantom Menace (1999) II,  Attack of the Clones (2002) III, and Revenge of the Sith (2005) IV were not enjoyable at all.
Matter of opinion, my friend. Yes, the actors playing Anakin were all wooden and lame, but we were able to see the Jedi council and learn about the birth of the Empire.
Honestly, I preferred the now non-cannon novels and comicbooks' explanations of those things. The CGI Yodi and Liam Nessen and Sam Jackson mailing it in did nothing for me.
Let's agree to disagree on the Prequels than. But we can both agree that A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back were amazing!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you enjoy Star Wars the Force Awakens?
I loved it.
What was your favorite part?
It had to be the battle at the end where Kylo and Rey battle.
That was a good scene, do you think they nailed it?
I do, I loved the interaction of the characters and how the ground was constantly shifting it made it exciting.
Plus it fleshed out their characters a bit more and made us feel more connected with them.
They did a great job at making people we don't know part of us quickly.
That was something I worried about was why should I care about these people.
They did a good job.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Star Wars episode 1 on TV last night, I can not believe the first episode came out in the 1970"s.
Yeah, that is a long time ago.
I like all the episode, the special effects is great.
Yeah,when Star Wars first came out, I thought the characters were funny looking.
That is part of "Star Wars" charm,the funny and weird looking characters.
I like Empire Strike Back, when Darth Vader VS Luke Skywalker.
Yeah, that was cool, Luke Skywalker almost lost the fight.
Luke Skywalker was trying to get Darth Vader back to his good self in that episode.
Yeah,Darth Vader end up dying in "Return of the Jedi",how sad.
Yeah, but Darth Vader came to realize he was on the wrong side in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, what do you like about Star Wars?
I like the aspect of some magic being thrown in with a bit of science.
Yeah, that's pretty neat, I've never really thought of the force as magic.
I can't imagine how else to think of it. Space Wizards, really, with their own ideas.
True. That could explain force sensitive people, they can feel the magic, but can't use it.
Yeah, like Princess Leia. She could always feel it, but wasn't exactly like her brother.
You know, that makes me curious, what if she could but was never really trained?
Well, she was a Princess so that makes sense. She was still pretty badass.
I do like the female characters being strong on their own.
They don't need anyone to save them, they aren't going to give in. Real role models.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, in Episode one of Star Wars, they said Anakin does not have a dad right.
Yes, that the force made him, with his mom.
So, he is more than half metaclhorins?
Yep, weird but yes.
And, they still had to question if he was the chosen one?
I always thought that part was odd.
Would they not have been a bit afraid of him?
I would think it was odd, him being so powerful.
I think that is why he went bad.
Why, due to people fearing him?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just Saw the new Star Wars movie Rogue One.
How did you like it?
I loved it and was glad to buy it on DVD.
I saw it when it came out at the movie theater.
I think it's great that they are spinning off of the original for new story lines.
I think so too. It will make the series so much richer.
It will also allow for endless possibilities.
The characters were memorable.
I think so too and I like how they did the back story to Leia and the ships map.
It makes the original make more sense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the best casting done on STAR WARS?
James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. I think that was genius!
It does add so much to the film. His voice is so deep and the tone was perfect for the role.
Darth Vader is such a pivotal character, they had to make sure to get it right.
I heard he thought of Orson Wells for it.
No one compares to Jones for me.
Wells does also have that baritone voice.
Fine they have the same range but james is my pick still.
You and George! ... And me ,I am a huge fan as well!
Well I am glad we all can share the love of james earl jones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite character?
You're going to have to be more specific...there are a lot!
fine, your favorite hero then?
easy! han solo
is he even a real hero?
he is in my eyes!
alright alright.
who's yours, then?
princess leia
not a bad choice
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favoite light saber?
I'd have to go with Darth Sidious'.
That doesn't count. There were two of them.
Ha! I just like how they were curved.
That was pretty awesome.
Yours?
Kylo Ren's.
What?!
I liked the hand guards.
Good for nothing but cutting your fingers off!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Your favorite star wars character?
Definetely yoda
Yea, I love that guy
How old is he?
I'm not sure, but he is filled with wisdom
I like that he can also fight
That fight scene with him using the lightsaber was awesome
Who is the actor for him?
Frank Oz I believe
What an amazing voice he has.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What were your favorite Star Wars Ships?
I like the fighters
I like seeing the dog fights
It is cool to see the x wings take on the tie fighters
Do you like the Death Star?
It is a big target, but pretty cool
I like the Naboo ships, the silver ones
The Naboo fighters look cool too
The Mellinnium Falcon is pretty cool
It is
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were there three different directors on all Star Wars movies?
Yes, they all had different ones
Who did the ogirinal?
George Lucas
He didn't do any of the other?
No, he went on as a producer
Who did the second one?
The Empire Strikes Back?
Yes
Irvin Kershner
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the scene after the credits in The Force Awakens?
Of course I did!
I can't believe Luke Skywalker is just hiding on an island.
Me either! It's so funny!
It's funny that they went through all the trouble to find the map piece.
It made for a fun movie though.
Yes it did!
Luke Skywalker's and Rey's stand off was everything to me!
I loved that part!
I can only hope that they are somehow related.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the worst Star Wars movie?
The worst Star Wars movie, in my opinion, was Revenge of the Sith.
I would have to agree. Although that whole set of three Star Wars movies from that time was bad too.
Yea, I wasn't a fan of who they cast as the young Annakin and the teenage Annakin.
Yes! Hayden Christensen's acting was so bad, it was unbearable to watch sometimes.
And Jar Jar Binks...I mean come on. Seriously?
Such a stupid character right?!
I don't understand what they were thinking when they decided to create that character.
Probably wanted him as comedic relief...but that didn't really work.
Fail on their part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which part of the Star Wars movies left you in complete disbelief?
Oh man, it was something that happened in The Force Awakens.
What happened in the movie that left you in disbelief?
It was when the Imperial Fleet fired up their weapon.
Oh man, that scene gave me goosebumps.
I got them too!
It was sad when they did closeups of the people on the planets getting destroyed.
It was! I can't even imagine what those people felt.
It sucks that they weren't able to do anything to stop it.
The Imperial Fleet are very ruthless and merciless!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Wookies ever shave?
I never thought of that.
Wouldnt that look weird? I wonder what they look like under all that fur.
I dont like the picture in my head at all.
Do you think they are just big people?
Well I mean, chewie has fangs, so, no.
Are they monkey related at all?
I have no idea, George Lucas just liked to make alot of things up for sure.
Yeah, but thats the best part of star wars, right?
Sure, whatever you say bud.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wonder how lucas came up with this
What
The whole idea for star wars
Prolly out of drugs
Nah he does not seem the type
You sure
yeah he was a nerdy one
I guess
Nah i am sure
Okay
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Rogue One movie?
Yeah, I thought it was pretty good, nothing spectacular.
Really?  I liked the main character.  I thought she was pretty cool.
I liked Rey better.
I'm really excited for the new one coming out this December.
I wonder if they're going to say who Rey is related to. Or if she's really just kind of a stand alone.
I think she's related to Obi Wan.
Yeah, I could see that.  It would be pretty cool.  I think Luke is kind of an obvious choice.
I'm pretty excited about the Han Solo movie I heard they are making.
Me too!  Han is one of my favorite characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was that Star Wars movie called with the Ewoks in it? It was an off-shoot of the Empires Strike Back I think.
That's an old one. It was called Ewoks, the Battle for Endor. Is that even part of the Star Wars Franchise?
I'm not sure, I know that Wicket, the first Ewok that befriended Princess Leia, was portrayed in it. But, I watched it for the first time a few days back and it seemed interesting.
It is, it does have some action in it, limited only to the planet Endor. No space battles or Jedi with their light sabers fighting one another. Kind of reminded me of a kids movie, like Dark Crystal or  Labyrinth.
I can attest to that. It was interesting though to see the Ewok world portrayed and described in much deeper detail. We should watch it again together this weekend?
No, even though I am not impartial to that movie, I would still prefer not to watch it again. When it comes to Star Wars, I want to watch unlimited action and adventure.
So then what do you want to watch this weekend?
I say we rent the Star Wars New Hope Trilogy and splurge on those movies. Make it a whole day too, because I can never get enough of looking at Luke Skywalker.  What do you think about that?
I'm well ahead of you. I already have everything set up for the weekend. Star Wars movies and all. Can't wait to kick back in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon for the whole day! You  bring the popcorn?
Popcorn. Check. Movies. Check. A date with Star Wars, here we come!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Poe or Finn are force-sensitive?
No.
Finn, for sure, I don't think is. But Poe has to be.
Why?
He took down something like ten clone troopers in a super short time in the battle.
That was pretty sweet, but I don't think that a humanoid can survive the G-force of those turns.
That's why he's a force-sensitive. He CAN survive what others can't.
Maybe, but maybe he's just good.
He also survived in a desert and relocated his entire fleet somehow without detection and without dehydrating.
Maybe. Looks like he can survive some crazy things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why is C3PO so annoying?
You don't like him?
Of course not.  He's a whiny robot with little worth.
R2D2 can obviously do more than him, but he's not worthless.
Think about most of his scenes.  He basically just says they're always in danger and going to die.
He also can compute things and help out with strategy.
Look, we'll just agree to disagree on this.  What role do you see him playing in the next few movies?
Not quite sure.  I know he'll be in them though.
My guess is maybe he'll do some sort of self-sacrifice to move the plot forward.
I could see that happening.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to come over and watch "Rogue One" this weekend? I just got it on DVD.
Sure, that movie was awesome! I'd love to see it again.
What was your favorite scene?
Hmm, that's a tough one, there was so much to like in that movie. I'd have to go with the Darth Vader scene at the end of the movie though.
Oh yeah, that was something else. I don't think I even breathed during that scene, it was so intense!
Right? Darth Vader is such a great villain. His storyline throughout the series is one of my favorites!
Yeah, such a great character. I did like many of the new characters in "Rogue One" though too, even if they didn't make it past the end of the movie.
Yeah, Jynn and Cassian were great leads.
And who could forget K2-SO! Haha
Oh yeah, he was the best and really brought up some great dialogue between the main group of rebels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does the character of C3PO need to still exist?
Yeah and I think R2D2 and him make a good duo.
They seem like they are just around now for no reason.
They offer alot in terms of the story line though.
I just think they are old characters and Star Wars needs to depart them.
I think they will but they need a bridge
For what purpose?
To connect older fans to the new Star Wars
So Luke eventually gets killed off?
I just think hes older and he has to go away
XXXXXXXXXXX
The original trilogy is the only Star Wars canon, hands down!
No way, the new movies are just as canonical as the older stuff.
Are you saying Jar Jar Binks is canon?
He's not the greatest character, no, but he is canon.
"Not the greatest"? He was so annoying!
His people thought that, too.
They were right. I would've killed him off.
But he did have a part to play, and he became an ambassador later.
It didn't stop what happened.
He did what he could.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about how a Star Wars character caused a school lock down last month?
No, did some creep go to the school dressed like somebody from Star Wars?
It was a student dressed as a Star Wars Storm Trooper. A passerby saw him going into the school and called police, saying somebody was wearing a mask and body armor.
Why was the student dressed up like a storm trooper? It's not Halloween.
Apparently the school was celebrating Star Wars Day, May 4th, called :May The 4th Be With You.
Did the student get in trouble?
No, they said it was a "lapse of judgement."
Well I'm glad he didn't get punished.
The police said the bystander still did the right thing in calling in.
Better safe than sorry as they say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Jar Jar Binks?
No, he was annoying.
I agree. I liked 3PO way better.
Did you like the new film?
No, I thought it was very boring.
Yeah, it's kind of like they ripped off the old one and added a bunch of Star Trek ideas into it.
What was your favorite episode?
I liked the original the best.
That was a good one. Most people like Empire the best
That is also a great one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the chase scene in Return of the Jedi?
Yes
Did you think it was too long?
A bit
I liked the forest setting.
Yeah. That was pretty cool
Did you like the end star battle?
Yes
What about the saber battle?
I loved it
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first see a Star Wars film?
I saw it in the theater back in the Summer of 1977.
Wow, I didn't think you looked that old.  What did you think of it?
I thought it was a cool movie that got right down to business. It starts with a battle scene, unlike other movies that seem to take forever to get going.
So the first movie is still your favorite?
I'd say so, but I remember that I'd learned in kindergarten a few months before that if you put an s after a word it makes it plural, and there was only one war in that movie.
I guess George Lucas sort of fixed that as he went along.
I guess so, but I think it was a big mistake to make Luke Darth Vader's son.
But that's essential to the entire series.  Why do you think that?
In the first movie Luke and Han were everyman heroes.  Making Luke Vader's son turns him into a chosen-one superhero who comes by his by by his genetics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars or Star Trek?
I'm definitely more of a Star Wars guy.
Really? Why do you like it so much. I love the tech, and the futuristic points in Star Trek.
They are really different shows. I like both, but the fantasy in Star Wars gets me.
Yeah I see that.
Especially since I've really grown with the characters through the Universe.
The Star Wars characters are really unique, and all have interesting, wacky storylines.
Star trek has more tragedy, more of an alien, sci-fi component to it.
But aren't all the Star Wars characters weird enough to be aliens.
Aren't we all aliens?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite Star Wars movie director?
JJ Abrams.
Why did you like him?
Because I think the movies he directs are very well done.
What did you think of George Lucas?
He was okay, but I'm not a fan of the prequels.
I agree.  I hated the actor that played the young Anakin Skywalker.
Yeah, I think everyone did.  It's interesting that Anakin became Darth Vader.
Yes.  Darth Vader is one of my favorite characters.
So dark.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the Star Wars prequels?
They had some good moments, but overall I felt they were pretty disappointing.
What were some of the things you liked about the movies?
I really enjoyed the pod racing in the first film. I also enjoyed seeing lots of Jedi throughout all the films.
I thought having that many Jedi was overkill. It seemed lame to just flood the films with Jedi.
That's a fair point, but I felt that the Jedi were never properly explained or explored in the original trilogy.
I thought that made them more mysterious and interesting. We don't need to have everything fully explained in order to enjoy what's going on.
I think that was one of the big problems with the prequels, George Lucas tried to overexplain everything.
Yeah, that's how we ended up getting the "midi-chlorians" explaination of the force.
Right, Star Wars is science fiction, but it should be a lot more focused on the fiction than the science.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars Movie?
I like the third episode the best.
The third episode of the originals or the prequels?
The prequels, Revenge of the Sith.
What makes that movie so special to you?
I really enjoy watching Anakin Skywalker transform into Darth Vader.
Did you know he would eventually become Darth Vader?
As a kid I liked Anakin because I could relate to him as a kid, I never realized he would become Darth Vader though.
Does watching the prequels before the original movies make you feel any different about the originals?
No, I really the whole series, the new ones however are a little less interesting to me. They seem to lack a strong theme.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever wonder if R2D2 would be jealous of BB8?
Why would he be?
BB8 has greater mobility and way more spunk.
Yeah there's no way R2D2 could have navigated those sand hills in The Force Awakens.
I think R2D2 can hover though, so maybe he could have just hovered over them.
Nah, he would have gotten so much sand in his gears.
True, plus his hovering abilities are pretty substandard.
They came in  pretty handy when he was stuck in that swamp in Dagobah though.
BB8 is still superior I think.
Well he's the millennial's R2D2 so of course he's improved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
rey is my new favorite character
you think so? my favorite character is finn
he is a good character, but rey is a jedi
there are a lot of theories going on around her.
really? how so?
some people think that she is obi wans granddaughter.
really? that would be awesome!
kind of, but i would rather see her with other parents.
why do you think that?
people would freak out if the theory was true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
I like Jaba the Hut
Really?  He's so fat though!
I know, but he's funny looking!
True that!
Why do you ask
No real reason, just wondering
Oh, okay!  What's yours?
R2-D2
He's cool too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a star wars fan?
Yes I love all of those movies!
Which is your favorite?
I really liked the fourth one a lot.
I liked that one too because it was so classic.
What was your favorite part?
The ending when luke, leia and han solo walked down that isle to get the medals.
Oh yeah that was a cute moment.
I concur.
It was nice talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that Rey is underwritten as a character?
Yes. Her ability to access the Force was the biggest distraction in The Force Awakens.
Why do you think that?
Luke and Anakin had to train and still got beaten up in their trilogies.
Oh, right.
However, they could make her into a new Chosen One.
That would be too repetitive.
I agree, but these movies tend to recycle certain elements.
Yes, but only to a point. The Prequels didn't copy plots.
Ah, true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was three years old when Star Wars: A New Hope was released in 1977.
Did you get to see it in the theater?
No, but I got to see on good old VHS later. I had a huge crush on Mark Hamill!
I  can understand that. I saw the older trilogy later after the Phantom Menace was released. But Mark Hamill was handsome as Luke in A New Hope.
Who was your favorite actor from Phantom Menace?
Definitely Liam Neeson. He was so subtle and had a great acting style. He played Qui-Gon Jinn perfectly.
I read that George Lucas filmed the Star Wars movies in the order that he did, because of the lack of CGI technology in the late 1970's and 1980's.
I believe that's true. There is certainly more room to work in now regarding Sci-Fi movies.
Do you think that the current technology takes away from the human element in the Star Wars saga now?
Not at all. I think the actors shine ever more greatly and that is evident particularly in Rogue One when Cassius and Jyn embrace and die together, for the cause.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a star wars fan
Not really
Why not?
I just never got into them
You should watch them
Are they good?
They are really good
Ill look into them
You wont be disappointed
I hope not
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whatever happened to Hayden Christensen?
Oh, you mean young Darth Vader.
Well, he was Anakin Skywalker at the time, not Darth Vader.
He technically was Darth Vader at the end of the third film.
Fine, whatever.  My point is that he doesn't seem to have done much after Star Wars.
He probably made a boatload of money from portraying Anakin.
Speaking of which, how did Darth Vader even survive?  I mean, he was pretty beat up.
Guess they got him those new body parts just in time.
I wonder if his suit has good air conditioning.
You have way too much time on your hands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why does Luke call Obi Wan Kenobi, Ben?
Obi Wan cultivated that persona when he brought Luke to his Aunt and Uncle.
Why did he bring Luke to his Aunt and Uncle?
He needed to get him away from his father, Darth Vader.
Where did his sister end up at?
She ended up on the planet of Alderaan.
Who were her parents?
Her parents were the Organa's, General Organa took her immediately after birth.
Who named Leia and Luke?
Padme named them before she died.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Revenge of the Sith.
I saw it only once.
I think Padma Amidala was once again, hot.
Agreed.  What else did you like?
I liked when Anakin killed the kids.
Very disturbing,  Hard to think of him as a hero thereafter.
I liked how Obi-wan cut Anakin up, though.
Yes, that was gruesome.
The saddest part was when Padma Amidala died.
I loved the funeral scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you getting pumped for that New Star Wars movie this winter?
Yeah, I'll definitely go see it.
You don't sound super pumped.
The last two movies they've made were definite improvements over the prequels, but they were both movies that I found myself liking less the more I thought about them.
Oh, so you're a Star Wars hater.
No, I definitely have a soft spot in my heart for Star Wars!
Haha, OK. What's your favorite prequel?
Probably the third one. Revenge of the Sith or something?
Yeah, I think that was it.
It was the only one of the three that wasn't objectively bad, in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Hmm...my favorite Star Wars character would have to be Obi Wan Kenobi.
Why so?  There are plenty of other characters.  What makes him your favorite?
I feel like he is morally correct and thinks through his actions compared to others.  Plus, he uses a blue lightsaber.
Blue lightsaber?  What makes it better than the other colors?
It's not more powerful...I just prefer the color blue.
So, what about Rey?  She uses a blue lightsaber.
Rey is not my favorite.  She's a good character though.  Who is your favorite character?
I like Kylo Ren.  His cross-guard lightsaber is actually really cool.
I told you...lightsabers do have something to do with your favorite Star Wars characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about Star Wars. Some people are really invested in the series of movies.
I've seen a few of them, although the did get kind of boring after a bit. Very white, male fantasy focused.
Yes, giving time to women's voice in the series, might have been a nice change. I hear the newest one has a strong woman character?
Yes, that's been getting a lot of publicity. Although the demographic that fixates on Star Wars, is white, male, for sure, definitely that audience.
So much of media is saturated in with that perspective. It's hard not love some of the characters like Chewbacca, even if it is somewhat flawed.
Yes, although you wonder if it's aesthetic in appeal, more than written content.
Because Chewbacca looks like a big walking teddy bear?
Right. And the voices of R2-D2 and the droids, were very soft and kind of lovable.
Kind of going for the comic angle. Do you think the plot was too simplistic though, all that good and evil simplicity?
Maybe. Like chopping off Luke's hand, could definitely be Freudian. Emasculating, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a bigger fan of Star Wars or Star Trek?
I definitely liked Star Wars more growing up.
Who was your favorite character?
Han Solo was my favorite.
He's definitely the coolest character in the series.
They are supposed to be making some movies that he is the focus of in the future.
I've heard about that. Harrison Ford is still a great actor, so they should be very good.
I heard they just had to replace the directors for those movies.
I'm sure they will still be good anyway.
Rogue One was a very good movie. Episode I: The Phantom Menace was the only one that I didn't think lived up to the quality of the series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the theme is of Star Wars?
Its theme? I guess it would be a morality tale - you know, do the right thing.
But Anakin attempts to do the right thing, and it leads to his downfall.
He does it in a selfish way, and he gives in to anger.
So you're saying its theme is telling you how to be a good person?
I guess so. Yoda tells Luke, for example, not to give in to anger and hatred.
He says the same thing in the prequels. He says anger leads to hate, which leads to suffering.
The prequels weren't nearly as well written, though.
Do you think the new trilogy, starting with The Force Awakens, will follow up with that?
It might, but I think it might be better if it finds something new to say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which of the robots from Star Wars is your favorite?
Hands down, my favorite is R2-D2.
Why is R2-D2 your favorite?
He is able to do so many different things. He is so adaptable and can help out in any situation
Do you think that he actually has a personality?
Of course. He is such an old droid.
What did you think about him appearing in the newest movies again?
It's pretty awesome. I hope they will expand a bit on this story line, as he is one of the most iconic characters from the old movies.
What did you think of the newest robot introduced, the BB-8?
He's not as memorable as the older robot versions, but he has some of the similar capabilities to R2-D2.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Star Wars Episode I for the first time.
For the first time?  Did you like it?
The special effects are a bit outdated, but overall it was a good story.
I liked the story as well, especially learning about the Force.
I found the Chewbacca character to be most interesting.  It's not often you see talking animals outside of cartoons.
To be fair, he's an alien more than he's an animal.
I guess you're right.  I just think it's interesting that he speaks his own unique language that only one person can understand.
That is kind of funny.  It's the same way with the droids.
What do you mean?
Some characters seem to be able to understand the beeping sounds they make as communication.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are the furry, bear-like creatures in Return of the Jedi?
They are Ewoks.
Are they friendly?
No. They are pretty violent.
Why do they like Luke, Leia and Han?
Because they think C3PO is their god.
What planet do they live on?
They live on Endor.
Is it an Imperial planet?
No, they only use it as an out-post.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Star Wars movies?
You mean the brand new, the newer, and the old?
Yes. Have you seen them?
Yes I have. Have you?
I have. Who is your favorite character?
I like Han. He is such a complex character.
So do I. He is hard to figure out.
I know, you can't really tell where he stands for so long.
Of course I love his companion Chewie as well.
Oh, who wouldn't love that guy?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Star Wars movies had a seriousness about them.
Yes, they did.
Even though they were entertainment, they were serious.
George Lucas was a big part of conveying that.
Lucas really developed his characters.
I think the character development was one of the best things.
All of the movies had continuity.
Yes, they all flowed well.
The new installments aren't as good as the old.
Disney has kind of downgraded the franchise somewhat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rougue One yet?
Yes!  That was maybe in my top three Star Wars movies.
Yeah, it was terrifying to see what the Empire really could do.
I'm also glad they explained the whole part about why the Death Star was so vulnerable.
The best part of the movie though, when Vader cut down all those rebels.
Yes!  That was amazing, back to the roots of Vader being an unstoppable force.
The way he just threw them around, and deflected beams with this hand and force powers.  I've never seen anything like that.
Exactly what a villain should be.  Vader is just plane scary.
And it sounds morbid, but I like the fact everyone died.
No not at all, I know what you mean.  It added realism and depth to the entire franchise.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know they are doing a Han Solo movie?
I was unaware of that.
Yeah its supposedly just going to be focused on just him.
I think this ruins Star Wars.
Why?
Because the plot needs to be linear.
So you dont like spin off types of movies?
No I think it gets hard for a fan to keep up.
Well its not like a show where you need to keep up with the way the plot moves.
Yeah I mean I know you have time but I think its all a bit wrangling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
I like it.
Who is your favorite character?
Yoda
I hope they do a movie on him.
He was the best Jedi.
He took on the most powerful guy in the galaxy.
But he lost
He gave up
He would have been stopped by the guards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars ship?
I am a fan of the Emancipator
What Era is that from
It's from the Rise of the Empire era
Oh I think I remember that one
It was used during the Battle of Ylesia
Now I remember!
Yeah i loved the effects on the ship
Yeah thats when the graphics started getting good
It's one of the best ships of the new era
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rogue one is a good film?
I think Rogue one is the best film Since Empire Strikes Back. I loved K2SO.
He was a fun, intelligent robot. I cared about him.
I did too. I cried when he died.
I cried when everyone died.
Me too. I don't know how they could possibly make a sequel.
If they did one, it would have to be with a completely different group
When would it be set, do you think?
My guess it would be between Empire and Return of the Jedi, when the Rebellion is in shambles.
That could be very interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How excited are you for the upcoming Han Solo movie?
Cautiously excited.
Only cautiously?
I'm worried because both directors left.
They did? I didn't hear about that.
Yes, apparently there were creative differences.
That's not good.
No, it sounds worrying.
Oh well. At least we have the rest of them!
This is true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars movies are much better now that Disney has taken over.
What do you think is better?
The three made before were just bad.
Can you be more specific.
Sure: the actors were bad, the characters were awful, the plotlines were bad.
I see.  What is better about Disney's versions?
They went  back to the original characters and stories.
I suppose I can see your point. What else?
They are more true to the original three movies, as far as storylines.
I will have to go see the newer ones, as I haven't yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasn't it great to see Carrie Fischer and Harrison Ford in the Star Wars film, "The Force Awakens?"
Yes, but I liked the new characters, too.
The new characters were awesome. Kylo Ren had an inner struggle between the Force and the Dark Side.
Yes, and being the son of Leia and Han made him all the more interesting.
What did you think of the Oscar Isaac character?
Poe Dameron? He was great, too.  I love Oscar Isaac.
Were you upset when Han died?
Yes, but I figured Harrison Ford wouldn't do many more sequels.
It was really emotional when Rey found Luke at the end.
Yes, I had goose bumps during that scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did Finn turn on the stormtroopers in The Force Awakens?
Because of the atrocities he'd witnessed. He wanted to escape it.
But didn't he grow up with them? Why was he the only one who objected?
As a fluke, his training and conditioning didn't take.
I would've liked to see Finn express more remorse about it, though.
Why? Finn isn't an evil person.
But he turned on everyone he knew. He killed people he used to serve with.
He did it for the greater good, though.
That doesn't make it emotionally easy.
Perhaps he's just stoic. He's burying how he feels because there's work to do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of these days, I'd like to see a back story on what happened with the New Republic after Luke destroyed the Empire.
Me too, at least a short backstory on things going right, then taking a turn for the worst.
Like how Kilo Ren turned.
Or maybe the business as usual aspect.  While the Phantom Menace wasn't the best of movies, seeing the Senate was important to the whole of the Star Wars plot.
It was, it showed that at one time the world had hit's problems but was stable to say the least.
And that the Jedi Order was once well known, and were great peacekeepers.
I'd like to see how the Jedi worked under Luke as Grand Master.
Yes, was he the same as Yoda?  Or did he have a different approach.
Like about the vows of celibacy and poverty?
Exactly, was that something he did?  Or were there new rules allowing for families?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Star Wars fan?
Yeah, I love all the movies.
Even the prequels?
Well, those were okay. I guess I didn't love them.
Yeah, I doubt many people did.
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
I really like Return of the Jedi. I didn't mind the Ewoks like some people did.
What do you think about The Force Awakens and Rogue One?
I thought they were really good. Of the two I preferred Rogue One.
Yeah, I really liked how they integrated old footage of the X-Wing pilots.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the new take on the Star Wars universe presented in the Force Awakens?
It was done well, but it was a bit too similar to New hope in many ways.
How do you mean? How were they similar?
Rey is on a desert planet very similar to Tatooine and a lot of other things are very similar between the two movies.
I can see that. But I really enjoyed how they personified a storm trooper this time.
Yeah that was very unique. I didn't expect to see a storm trooper using their own will.
Do you think Finn has some Force sensitivity?
There haven't been special indications of it, but there is always a possibility.
Would you like to see his story line progress further?
It could be interesting but I'm always more interested in the mystical part of the Force and the characters most affected with it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite star wars character
I would have to say Darth Vader
Why? But he's the villain!
His complex story really interests me
What do you mean by complex
I mean think about it, we start from Episode 1 and see how young Anakin Skywalker grows up and develops as a character
I see
I just like seeing a character go from zero to villian because the story is interesting
Who is your least favorite then?
Jar Jar, no doubt
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi bro
Whats good man
Nothing much
Same so i got some questions about star wars stuff
Yeah what is up
Well i want to know what you think do you think Anakin is proud of his grandson?
Nah i think that he is let down by his actions for repeating them and following his footsteps
I kinda feel the same but wonder if he is really dead
Their is some possibility he is alive you never know
True enough it can be possible
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite scene in all of Star Wars is the Trench Run from Episode IV. What is yours?
My favorite is the Battle of Hoth.
Which part of the Battle of Hoth, because that's a pretty long battle?
Oh, it's definitely the AT-AT walkers showing up and laying waste to the Rebel Alliance defenses.
Not the Snow Speeders bringing down the AT-AT with tow cables?
No, watching the AT-AT just walking across the snow on the giant movie screen was amazing.
I feel the AT-AT portion of the battle was too contrived. The Empire had ships and air superiority, they didn't need the AT-AT.
Not true at all. It makes perfect sense for the Empire to employ walkers. The Rebels had a planetary shield protecting the base.
I refuse to believe that dinky shield generator could have held up against the combined firepower of those Star Destroyers.
It was initially only 2 Star Destroyers and don't forget the Rebels also had that massive Ion Cannon!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first see star wars?
I first remember watching bits and pieces of the Return of the Jedi when I was about six years old at a friends house.  How about you?
My dad would watch the original three movies with me when I was a kid.  I had to much of it memorized.
The scene I remember the clearest is when Luke gets away from the sand worm.
I always thought that part was pretty cool!
What scenes stood out to you the most when you first saw the movies?
I hated watching Leia as Jaba's slave.  That part disturbed me.
I didn't like when Luke took Darth Vader's mask off right before he died.
But I really liked the swamp planet where Luke first met Yoda.  I thought Yoda was awesome.
Luke impressed me when he used the force to get his plane out of the water.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Mine would have to be Darth Vader.
Why is that? What is good about him?
Well, it depends on your definition of good. Darth Vader did what he thought was right.
He killed so many innocent people though.
That is true, but his girlfriend was killed.
Interesting. I guess he is good at what he does.
Indeed. He is a very strong character who gets what he needs.
I might go back and re watch the series and pay more attention now.
I would. It is a good way to understand a character better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like the most recent Star Wars movie, the Force Awakens?
I thought it was more interesting than Jar Jar Binks.
You didn't like Jar Jar Binks?
No.  I thought it was a very poor attempt at reaching younger audiences.
Do you think Star Wars movies are ill suited for younger audiences?
No.  I think Star Wars is acceptable for all ages in general.
Is that the only reason you enjoyed the Force Awakens?
Mostly.  I think J.J. Abrams did a mediocre job, though he is better suited for Star Wars than Star Trek.
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I would say my favorite is Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did Luke's aunt and uncle do for a living?
They "farmed" water?
How do you "farm" water?
Moisture vaporators.
I guess that'd be pretty lucrative on a desert planet.
Indeed!
I guess that's why they needed C3-PO?
Huh?
Needed a translater to "talk" to the vaporators.
Too weird!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like return of the jedi?
Yes that is actually one of my favorites
Thats one of my favorites too
Cool
Luke skywalker was amazing in it
Yes he was
I love how hans solo and leia got back together
That part was great
It really was
Love the movie
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about the new Star Wars spin-off?
Which one?
The one that's all about Han Solo.
That scoundrel.  Cool.
Yeah.  It takes place before he met Luke and Leia in the original trilogy.
That should be interesting!  Is Chewbacca going to be in it?
Of course!  What is a Han Solo movie without Chewie?
Cool.  Who's directing the film?
I heard it was Ron Howard!
Oh my God!  He's a great director!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the new star wars movies?
I guess they are ok.
What's wrong with them?
There's nothing wrong with them, I just miss the old characters.
They have a lot of the old characters in them though.
Yea, I know, but only as nostalgia.
Well, they are too old to be action starts now.
That's true, but I hate that they killed Han Solo.
I heard that Harrison Ford told them to because he was tired of doing the movies.
Yea I heard that too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, who was your favorite Star Wars Alien?
Chewbacca, obivously!
Huh, I kind of liked Greedo a little.
What, why. The guy was a loser.
Yeah, but he did have the guts to talk tough to Han Solo.
Yeah, right until Han blasted him.
Yeah, that whole edit of having Greedo shoot first was just dumb.
Yeah, Han's a bit of rogue and Greedo was a slimebag, so why not shoot first?
Plus, the whole last minute shift by Solo looks lousy.
Yeah, but it's not like they could really reshoot the scene with him dodging the shot, now could they?
XXXXXXXXXXX
OK, so favorite Star Wars moment. Go!
OK. Wait, do you mean in the movie, or like, where we were at certain times?
Let's stick to movie moments.
Hmm, OK. I don't know if I have a favorite. There's so many. How about when Lando walks in on Darth and Darth says "I am altering the arrangement. Pray that I do not alter it further."
Ha, yeah, that's a great one. How about when Han and Leia are on Hoth, and she calls him a scruffy, no good nerfherder.
"Who's scruffy looking?" Ha, classic.
You know, I like to use the line "Seems like I'm going nowhere" when someone asks me where I'm going.
Ha, yeah, Luke on Tatooine. Nice. "But I was going to go to Tasha Station and pick up some power converters!"
The whole movie is just full of quotable moments.
Just one long string of them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Want to hear a fun fact about the third movie?
I imagine you're going to tell me anyway.
Indeed I am.  It was originally called Revenge of the Jedi.
Instead of Return of the Jedi?
Yeah.  They changed it weeks before opening the film.
I like return better anyway.
I guess they thought it didn't make sense because a Jedi shouldn't seek revenge.
Yeah, they don't seem vengeful to me.
You would have thought someone would have caught that earlier.
Guess they were busy getting the film finished, eh?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everyone knows that "The Empire Strikes Back" was the best "Star Wars" movie.
I disagree with that. It was the best.
What? You think the new movie was better than "Empire"?
Yes, I do. Absolutely.
You're nuts. They killed Han Solo.
Yes, they did. Which is, honestly, part of the reason I like it.
You like that they killed Han Solo?
Rules of the universe. Doesn't how far away you go, or how long ago it was. Everyone gets old. Everyone dies.
Not in the movies.
Yes, even in the movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What other Star Wars spinoffs do you think they should do?
Aside from Rogue One and the Han Solo movie.
Right.  What other ones should they do?
I would actually like to see a Yoda origin story.
That would be pretty cool.  Nobody knows where he came from.
It would obviously be heavily CGI, but the fans would dig it.
I don't think Disney has that on the roadmap though.  Think he'll come back in any of the next few movies?
As a spirit?  Doubtful, I think they've moved on from him.
He was so cool in the last prequel battling the emperor.
He does have some impressive moves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where do you think Star Wars goes from here?
I think Kylo Ren becomes the next Darth Vader.
For the rest of the series?
Well do we know how long its actually going to go?
No but I am presuming quickly.
I mean Kylo Ren could become Darth Ren
That would not sound right at all
Well he will be the next villain for countless movies
Yeah I think thats where he ends up
And Rey becomes the next Luke
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
My favorite is A New Hope, of course.
That's my favorite too.
It's definitely the best one.
Who is your favorite character?
Leia, of course.
Why is Leia your favorite?
She's beautiful, but poised in a world facing danger.
Did you see The Force Awakens yet?
Yes, we saw it in the theater opening night.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is better, Rey or Finn?
Finn is much more entertaining. He's funny.
But Rey seems like she's the main character.
Maybe that's the problem with her. She does everything too perfectly.
What do you mean?
She flies the Millenium Falcon better than Han Solo does!
Not really. She only repaired something Han didn't know about.
Repairing the Millenium Falcon is something Han Solo should be the expert in.
Han hadn't seen the ship in years, though. It was stolen from him.
I guess they wanted us to know Rey is an expert pilot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would win if Luke fough Darth Maul.
Is this legends canon or Disney?
It's Disney canon.
Maul would win then.
Maul, how would he win?
Luke really doesn't have any feats.  At best, he beat Vader, who didn't want to win and was taking a dive.
And Maul was killed by Obi-Wan, who Vader beat.
After killed Qui-Gon Jin, who was better than Obi-Wan.  Obi-Wan got lucky.
He also lost to Palpatine, Luke didn't.
Luke was being electrocuted to death. That's a loss.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Rogue One.
I thought it was a decent movie although I expected more out of it.
Yeah, what did you expected?
I wanted to see more Darth Vader scenes, they didnt take advantage of this element.
I know it would have been great to see more Vader scenes.
What character did you like the most?
I liked the new robot it was pretty funny.
Yeah it was I liked him too, and details of the movie?
I thought it was interesting to see the creation of the Death Star, what about you?
I also liked that detail it was pretty interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite character in Star Wars?
I'd have to say it was Luke.
I like Luke as well.
Yeah he was great in the Empire Strikes Back.
His acting was phenomenal.
Yes it was... there was definitely suspension of disbelief.
His interaction with R2D2 tugged at the heart-strings.
It sure did. That little robot was fantastic.
I was worried it was going to get destroyed during the fighter scenes.
Yeah, me too! It was scary!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many Star Wars movies are there?
I would have to say 8, including The Force Awakens and Rogue One.
I've seen two of them. Revenge of the Sith and Attack of the Clones.
So you've never seen any of the ones from the 70's?
No but I've been making it a point to watch them. What's your favorite of the originals?
I'd have to say Return of the Jedi. That's when things got real.
Oh yeah? Well is it necessary for me to watch them in chronological order?
I would say that's your best bet so that it flows seamlessly for you. The storyline I mean.
Oh ok. Is it true that James Earl Jones does the voice of Darth Vader?
Yes! He's such a great voice actor. One of the greatest of our time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you have any disappointments with The Force Awakens?
You mean besides Han Solo dying?
Yeah, besides that.
Well, I felt the whole Leia and Han's son going to the Dark Side was kind of unoriginal?
What do you mean? I didn't see that coming.
You remmber the now no longer canon Expanded Star Wars Universe.
Yeah, so what about it?
In that universe, Jacen Solo, the oldest son of Leia and Han, went all Dar Side as well.
Oh, so you mean that having a kid of Han and Leia go bad, had been done before.
Yes, just not in the movies, but the books.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you like better, R2-D2 or BB-8?
Man that's a tough one!
You have to chose one or the other!
I will always love R2-D2, but as of right now, I like BB-8 more.
Why do you like BB-8 more?
I guess BB-8 has more of a personality than R2-D2.
I agree with you!
BB-8's interactions with everyone was hilarious.
My favorite part when when BB-8 gave Finn a thumbs up.
That was so cute!

What was your favorite Star Wars movie?
I really cant name one specific one I liked the most.
Did you like the prequels?
I mean Natalie Portman was good in them
I think they were a little dull to be honest.
Not me, I appreciated their backstory
I think Lucas over shot his coverage with them
In what respect?
Well they didnt need to develop some of the plotlines
Sure they do the Star Wars universe is huge
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rogue One was as good as the other Star Wars movies?
Yes, but it was very different from them.
How was it different?
The other movies focus on a specific group of heroes - like Han, Luke, and Leia. But Rogue One focused on ordinary people.
The cast of Rogue One was just as heroic.
But they were normal. They were pilots and soldiers, not Jedi.
Han Solo was just a pilot, too.
He was a super pilot - he was the best pilot, not "just a pilot."
I guess that's true. He made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs, after all.
Whereas in Rogue One, all the characters were just ordinary. That gave it a lot different of a tone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched the Phantom Menace on TV last night.
Is that the first time that you had seen it?
No, I saw it on opening night back when it first came out.
Me too. I remember calling 1-800-moviephone to find the nearest locations!
I remember that service!
Yeah, time really flies.
What did you think of the movie on this go around?
It seemed more cute than realistic.
I agree. After seeing how realistic and gritty Rogue One was, the prequels seem like they were meant to be watched by kids.
I can see that. But seeing Darth Maul still makes me cringe every time I see the first prequel!
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what the new Star Wars movies need?
More actions? More drama?
A killer cyborg.
That took an unexpected turn.
In the original trilogy, you had Darth Vader. In the prequels you had General Grievous, but in the new movies, nothing.
Snoke could be a cyborg for all we know?
Even if he is, he hasn't killed anyone, so it hardly counts.
I see your point.
It's one of those classic Star Wars motifs. It needs to be brought back.
To be fair, Saw Gerrera was pretty mean, and he had a cybernetic leg. But I guess that doesn't really count for several reasons.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo what is good
Nothing much
That is cool i am in a debate
A debate with who
Some kid who thinks he knows what is the best movie
How is he wrong?
Well he is saying Episode 2 is a good movie
Aw man that movie
Yeah right?
It is the worst of all the movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the last time you watched Star Wars.
It was when I saw Revenge of the Sith.
The Sith got their revenge.
The movie was very politically charged.
No one could agree on anything.
You would think a civilization that advanced would have eliminated war.
Not everyone was civilized.
Some of them were ugly.
Jabba the Hut was really ugly.
Yeah
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Star Wars Movie?
Rogue One? Yes I have.
Don't you just love it?!
I do! I have to admit I cried a couple of times.
Me to. I cried when I thought Cassian had died.
Which one is Cassian again?
The actor was Diego Luna.
Yes! I remember.
I also cried when Chirrut Imwe, played by Donnie Yen, died as well.
That last battle scene on that planet was very sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which star wars movie is your favorite?
The first one definitely, its originality was awe inspiring.
The first one really? Mine was The Empire Strikes back.
Why did you like that one more than the others?
Well simply because Darth Vader is my favorite character in any of the movies.
That's funny because Qui Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi are my favorite characters.
Oh, so that's why you like the first movie so much, haha.
Yep, and Its crazy that Obi Wan was killed by Darth Vader.
Yeah that scene was pretty weird, it almost seemed like he just let himself get killed.
Well, I think what he was doing is transcending to a spiritual level like other jedi did when they died, I read something about how a jedi can do that if he is powerful enough. His body was missing when he was killed so I would think that is what happened.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the new Star Wars movie?
I liked The Force Awakens for the most part.
Were you surprised when Han Solo died?
I was. I couldn't believe he would die like that of all people. I feel like Princess Lea should of been the one to die.
Which character was your favorite? I really like Rey.
Rey is cool but so is the Storm Trooper guy named Finn.
Do you think Rey is Luke Skywalker's daughter or Han Solo's?
It's so hard to tell. On one hand I really feel like Luke was but there was that one line that implied Han could of been her dad.
I have one feeling that she is Kylo Ren's twin since in the book series Han Solo and Lea had twins.
That would be really freaky if she was Kylo Ren's long lost twin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which star wars movie did you like the best?
I still like A New Hope.
Oh really?
Yeah it is such a classic.
Who was your favorite actor in it?
I like James Earl Jones.
Me too, he does an amazing job as Vader.
I agree.
Don't you think the older movies are better than the newer ones?
Totally.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey tell me about some of your favorite movies?
Sure i can if you want
I most definitely want to know your favorites
I am not much of a movie person but my favorites are star wars
I am not to fond of them myself
Why not
Well i prefer Star trek?
i think the production values are bad by comparison
Well i guess
And the lore is much worse.
XXXXXXXXXXX
This Star Wars stuff, the movies, how do I watch them?
You mean in what order?
Yes, they are really confusing, the old ones, the new ones, the newer new ones.
Well, I would watch them how they were made to be watched, in order of release, the way the plot plays favors that order.
The plot, what is the plot, on a whole of all of them.
It is complex, but could be brought down to a fight between dark and light, good and evil. And lasers.
How so, I only know a little.
Well, the force is everything, in the movies, it is good, it is bad, it is all. All the films struggle with the aftermath of finding a balance of that.
Like the Luke guy trying to kill the Vader guy?
That, no that never happen, not really. He wanted to save Vader more than kill.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, do you think Watto could learn the ways of the force?
No, he's a toyderian. I don't know what that means, but he is one of those.
It's funny that there are so many classes of people.
Yeah, Tattoine seems to have lots of different races.
I thought that Watto was a good character.
Yeah, I liked how greedy he was.
I wonder what happened to him after episode 2.
He probably just stayed on Tattoine.
I preferred the Watto from Episode 1.
Me too. He had like two lines in the Episode 2. That us not enough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they will get around to making a movie based on the cartoon
What cartoon
The clone wars
I do not know if they will ever make a clone wars movie
It would be cool if they did though
I mean i guess
No i mean it
It does not look like that interesting of an era
Why not
just dont
XXXXXXXXXXX
Favorite Villian in Star Wars who is it?
The obvious would be Darth Vadar but I don't think that would be my favorite
So who is it?
Give me a minute this requires some deep thought
give me a break, its easily Boba Fett, he pretty much is the entire Clone army and he tries to kill Han and Obi Wan
Right but he's only in a few movies, I think that Emporer Palpatine might be the biggest Villian that I like
What?  Yoda almost kicked his butt
No he didn't he was so good he forced Yoda into hiding
That's right, I guess he is a pretty good villian
See I told you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
We need more Chewbacca backstory!
We need Chewbacca to be more in the stories period!
I agree, although people tend to feel that an over exposure of Chewie in the movies would ruin his mystery.
I don't agree with that at all. I think Chewbacca is a really interesting character. He's strong, brave, and so loyal!
Did you cry when he screamed in pain after Han died?
I knew exactly how Chewie felt. It was like he lost a brother not just a friend.
Han and Chewie were basically family. All the adventures they went through.
I know. Chewie is awesome. He's like the big protective uncle in every family.
The cool uncle you knew would have your back and help you out with things your own father wouldn't let you do.
That's a bit much, but yeah, Chewie needs his own story so us fans can really learn more about his background!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love to watch old school Star wars movies how about you?
Yes! The new ones are just not as good.
I did like the newest one because it had princess Leia and Han solo but it was missing Luke skywalker.
I agree and I just don't see Leia and Han's son turning evil.
I agree and  I like how it gave way to more sequels but then again 7 was enough.
8 if you count Rogue one.
Yes I haven't seen that one yet because it goes completely away from the main characters of Leia,Han,and Skywalker and their families.
Yes but I hear it is really good, better than Revenge of the Sith.
Yea I didn't care for the actor playing Anakin/ Darth Vader in that one.
Yes and I like that they explained Darth Vader's back story in those Pre-quels but it  wasn't a nearly as good as the original star wars trilogy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Rogue One?
I thought it was great. It fit really well into the over-arching Star Wars story.
I agree. I thought it shoehorned very cleanly into the existing narrative.
I really like that Disney and LucasFilms has been incorporating strong female leads.
Yeah, Jyn Erso was a great character in Rogue One and Rey was a great character in The Force Awakens.
I'm really interested to see where the story goes with Rey in the next saga movie.
Yeah, I'm super excited for The Last Jedi to be released.
There's so much speculation right now about what is going to happen in the next story.
Yeah, I don't get too wrapped up in that as I don't want to know too much of the storyline going into the next movie.
Yeah, I like to be surprised too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What character did you identify with more, Han or Luke?
Definitely Han
Yeah I feel the same way too
I think he was more of a man's man
And Luke was a pretty boy?
No i just dont think he was relatable
Yeah Han was a better person
I wish he was the star of the movies.
We would say the same thing I am sure
Like reverse our feelings? I agree, Luke was not a character we could fully embrace
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did anyone really think Luke was a little short to be a stormtrooper?
Yeah... I know!  No, he could have decently passed for a storm trooper!
In fact, he had!  Or so I thought.  He was traipsing around the Death Star with Han Solo in storm trooper gear for a while before they managed to make it--basically un-harrassed--to the detention level.  So I would say he DIDN'T draw attention to himself for being short.
Maybe the purpose of that line Princess Leia used, "Aren't you a little short for a stormtrooper?" was in there to draw attention to, or further emphasize, the fact that Luke was basically still a teenager...a kid.  Lots of references to this throughout the film.  For example, Han Solo regularly refers to Luke as "kid..."
You're probably right.  I just can't help but think Leia's line there could have been so much more dramatic--even humorous...
Well, the banter between Obi Wan Kenobi, too, could have used some serious tinkering, too
I guess, overall, at the end of the day--while the original Star Wars trilogy had it's "meh" dialogue moments and lackluster acting-- it STILL, by far, outshines the later prequels George Lucas decided to crank out
Still nauseated at the over-complicated, boring, political plots and sub-plots that just made most Star Wars' fans miserable...the original trilogy had light-saber-induced limb amputations and surprise familial twists, etc.  The prequels had...what..votes of no confidence in the freakin' senate, and toddler-Vader pod racing and yee-hawing in the desert?  It...there just is no....I mean...is NOTHING sacred?
Jar Jar action figures and lunch boxes...the HUMANITY!!
I know!  Let's hope that DIsney makes it stop....please no more Star Wars abominations and atrocities...!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
how many star wars movies are there?
There are 10 and I have watched every one, twice
you must be a huge fan, which is your favorite
I love the return of the jedi, the ewoks, love them
They were so cute, my mom bought me a stuffed ewok when I was a kid
I have toys still, light sabers, star wars lego sets, and action figures
who is your favorite character?
Han solo is my favorite
He is mine as well, Harrison ford is an amazing actor
lets go watch one of the movies
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the two new Star Wars movies?
Yes, I saw "The Force Awakens and Rogue One"
What did you think about them?
I thought they were great.  They finally got back to basics.
Yes, they were both better than the 3 prequels
I am excited about Luke Skywalker coming back.
Me to,  I hated we didn't see more of him in the first one.
I know, I am ready to see him kick some ass.
I just think it's weird that he just decided to tell all his friends "good luck" and disappeared.
Hopefully they were do a good job explaining that in the next one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Luke should have had a bigger role in The Force Awakens.
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense that he'd just stay out there on an island for decades.
Yeah. It's incredibly irresponsible, if you think about it.
Certainly.  Luke from Return of the Jedi wouldn't have just ran away, he would have gone there and grabbed Kylo by the ear and brought him back home.
It's not like he could have been scared of Snoke. Snoke is nothing compared to Palpatine, and Luke confronted him without hesitating.
They were probably trying to do the Yoda thing.
But Yoda had an excuse, he was really old, and on his last legs. He also lost when he fought Palpatine. And originally, he wasn't even supposed to be a fighter.
Luke doesn't have those excuses, does he? Maybe Snoke did beat him.
If that's the case, then they have to show it.  It's also implausibly. Luke was one of the best.
He wasn't that good. He was only half trained.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Star Wars has a lot of Japanese influences in it?
You mean the name Obi Wan Kenobi?
No, I mean how George Lucas was in love with films by director Akira Kurosawa, and seemed to outright copy parts of his films for Star Wars.
Oh, I didn't know that. I thought he had just made it all up himself.
Not only scenes and ideas, but also costumes that mimicked Japanese clothing.
Wow, so the credit for the ideas goes to a lot of other people.
There was one film people thought Star Wars copied, but it was the opposite- they had seen Star Wars and been influence by it, but their film came out first, making everyone think the opposite.
A lot of art- movies, music, painting, seems to have been influenced by things before it.
Star Wars was also influenced by Japanese anime and manga, but in turn also later influenced them.
So we have the Japanese to thank for Star Wars, huh? I bet a lot of people don't know that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm wondering, did Mace Windu really defeat Palpatine in Revenge of the Sith?
What do you mean?
Windu knocks Palpatine down before Anakin arrives. Was that a ruse, or did Windu really win?
I'd assume Palpatine faked defeat to help turn Anakin.
Yeah, but Palpatine wasn't a skilled lightsaber user. He was more powerful with the Force.
I thought the Force made you a better lightsaber duelist?
But, Windu was an incredible duelist, and had Palpatine cornered in a small room. He even blocked his Force lightning.
I'm not sure. Maybe Windu really won.
I think it's open to interpretation, but I think Palpatine really was screwed if Anakin hadn't arrived.
Maybe. It could go either way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think would win, a young Rey or a young Leai?
Well, that is hard. Leai was strong but raised a princess.
And Rey was raised to be tuff.
True, but Leia always ended up on top, in everything she did.
I think she would be more mature, I mean come on she was a leader on Alderan before Luke even knew he was a jedi.
She is smarter, has wisdom.
But Rey has street smarts, living alone in the desert.
Scouring for food in old ruins and so on.
I think it may be a hard fight.
I think they would not fight, instead become a two woman team and defeat all the dark side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the upcoming Han Solo film.
I am excited about it, but it is hard to imagine anyone but Harrison Ford playing Han.
Yeah, Alden Ehrenreich has big shoes to fill for sure. I will probably go see it though.
Me too. Did I just here that they fired the directors?
Yes, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were fired because the producers felt the plot was getting too comical and they didn't want to change it.
Wow, who is going to finish it?
They brought in Ron Howard to do re-shoots and oversee the editing.
He is pretty good, I think he can do it. Didn't he work with George Lucas.
Yes, he was in American Graffiti and he also Directed Willow for George Lucas.
Oh, yeah, I forgot about Willow. It was really good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited to see the New Star Wars?
I was not a fan of the last one.
The Force Awakens?
No, Rogue One.
Why?
I did not like the story.
Well, it showed how the good guys got the plans.
Right, but we already knew what happen to them.
You mean in the older movies when they say the brave people all died to protect the plans.
Right, it was pointless.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what do you think Luke will be like in the Last Jedi?
I think he'll be very Yoda like.  All serious and stuff.
Yeah, I wish I saw more of him the The Force Awakens.
That would have been great.
He has to be, other than Vader, the most dynamic character in the franchise.
Yes, from cry baby about power converters to Jedi Knight.
I know, a galaxy famous one who destroyed the first Death Star.
And finally vanquished Darth Vader.
Yes, all the Skywalker's power must be almost unstoppable.
I know, I'm hoping to see some crazy things from him in the next movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Want to talk about movies
Sure
Star Wars is my favorite
Star wars is one of my favorites too
They have great story lines
Yes they really do
I love all the actors
Yes they did great casting
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
You look like quite the star wars fan.
Thanks! I would definitely consider myself a superfan.
What did you think of rogue one?
Dude dont get me started, it was so good!
Who was was your favorite character?
Probably the robot, he had so much life for a machine.
I dont know, he felt fake to me.
Whatever. They totally used a real robot for him!
No way, I thought they just CGI everything in star wars these days.
Learning  something new today, young padawan is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about star wars
Those are classic
I love them
Me too
I even have a replica light saber
Really
Yes
Thats so cool
You can get them on amazon
Awesome
XXXXXXXXXXX
In The Empire Strikes back what's something you don't like?
Well it's such a good movie that it's hard to come up with something I don't like but there's something that bother me in that movie?
I agree, it's almost a perfect movie. What bother you about it though?
Well in the Battle of Hoth, when Luke and another pilot bring down an AT-AT by deploying harpoons from their ship causing the AT-TI to fall.
What about it? That was a classic scene that many people love.
Well I always wondered why do space fighters have harpoons? There's no reason to have harpoons like that so it just seems to convenient to the plot.
There's an easy answer to that question. They might use them in space to attach to something and tow it.
That could be it. However they have tractor beams in the Star Wars universe so there's no need to use things like harpoons to tow stuff.
Well a tractor beam could be very large so it wouldn't fit on a small ship like the T-47 airspeeders that were used in the Battle of Hoth.
That makes sense. Now I love Empire Strikes Back even more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
All right, name the most memorable droids in Star Wars. I'll start with R2D2
C3PO, of course.
Ah, I see you C3PO, and raise you BB-8.
Okay, how about the Imperial Probe Droid.
That's memorable alirght, but GONK is more memorable.
Who?
The square droid from the sandcrawler in a New Hope, say's Gonk followed by some more gibberish
Oh, now I remember, but what about EV-9D9?
You lost me there, which one is that?
The droid in charge of Jabba's droids, the one that is having all those other droids tortured?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you like most about the Star Wars movies?
I like the technology like the droids and stuff.
Yes the AI in star wars takes it to the next level.
I wonder if it will ever be like that in real life.
When robots have real personalities like CP3O and R2D2.
It might some day you never know.
When they get like that they are almost human.
In Star Wars they still treat them as disposable despite the intelligence.
It will be an ethical dilemma to think about.
Sure will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite character in the Star Wars movie series?
Han Solo always seemed to be a very heroic, funny character.
There was chemistry between Han Solo and Princess Leia.
You think so? They were so far apart in age.
I always loved the deep voice of Darth Vader in the first movies.
I believe that voice is spoken by James Earl Jones. Do you know him?
James Earl Jones is a great actor. The later Darth Vader actors were not as convincing.
The outfit too was pretty wild for the times. Very scary and dark. What did you think of Yoda?
I thought the special effects could have been better with Yoda. Do you believe in The Force?
I think there is something beyond science that we cannot explain. That's one reason I love Star Wars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi there.
Do you like Star Wars.
Yes I would say so.
Do you have a favorite one?
I really enjoyed Empire Strikes Back.
Why that one in particular?
It is a little heavier than the first one.
I see.
Plus you get to see more of darth vader and the dark side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Princess Lea for sure.
As a person, she is hot, as a character, I'm not a fan.
Well who is yours then?
Jar Jar Binks.
Haha, you picked the most annoying character as your favorite?
Yea, that's exactly why I like him.
At least I chose a major character.
Who all she has going for her is her body!
And the fact she's been in the rebellion since she was born.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Ewoks are miniture versions of Wookies?
How do you mean?
In Return of the Jedi, Endor was originally supposed to be a Wookie planet.
Probably saved a ton on costumes.
Probably so! That would have been cool though.
True, but they did kind of do that in the prequels.
Yeah, I thought they did a pretty good job on that.
Yeah, if you like a lot of CGI!
I wonder if they'll introduce more Wookies in the new trilogy.
Maybe a Wookie spin off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Qui Con Jin?
Obi Wan Kanobi's mentor?
Yes, the one that Liam Neesin plays.
I do not  think they explored him as well as they should have.
I think he was a real strong guy, really intense.
He was the last of the old Jedi. I liked when he fought the SIth.
In the moving doors, yes, so much patience in his fighting.
It was more like a dance. I think it was foreshadowing.
Of what?
Of what would happen to the Jedi if they lost their patience, how they would be killed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hated Episode 1!!
Ware you nuts?  The huge battle on Naboo with he Trade Federation was amazing!
But Jar Jar ruined the movie.
But Queen Padma Amidala saved it, for sure!
Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn was pretty cool too.
If you are into dudes, I guess so.  Bet you liked Anakin Skywalker, too.
He is the bot that becomes Darth Vader, how can you not?
I'm not fan of the Dark Side, so I am on team Luke.
That means you get Yoda, too.  That is a good play.
But also Jar Jar.  So maybe Droids and TIE Fighters are the right path
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
Probably Han Solo or Boba Fett, what about you?
I like the Jedi characters like Obi Wan and Rey.
Did you like the prequel movies at all?
They were OK but not nearly as good as the original.
Did you like any of the Jedi in those movies?
I liked Liam Neeson's character but that's about it.
Yeah, I didn't like Anakin Skywalker at all.
I'm really excited for episode 8!
Yes me too, I can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hello
you busy
not really
What are you doing then
Just reading
What are you reading
I am reading some books based on star wars movies
Are they good
I am enjoying them
XXXXXXXXXXX
princess leia is a modern feminist icon
you're so right!
the only thing that makes her better is that she was played by a real woman
what do you mean?
carrie was real, authentic, messed up...and she was still famous! still an icon
i guess that is pretty inspirational for young, mentally ill women
you bet it is!
she was a great actress, too. i can't imagine anyone else pulling off the princess leia sass
that's because no one else could do it!
thanks, carrie
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Are you a fan of the Star Wars series?
Yeah absolutely.
Do you have a favorite?
I am really looking forward to the new Lando movie.
I didn't know they were making a Lando movie.
Yeah it's supposed to be great.
Who plays Lando?
Donald Glover.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What year did the first Star Wars come out?
It came out in theaters in 1977.
Do you know what the year the second one came out in?
It was released in theaters in 1980. Are you a fan of the originals?
I am I love the first and second one the best. Which one of the originals is your favorite?
I like Return of the Jedi the best.
That's the third one right?
Yes I don't know when that one came out but I was old enough to see it in theaters.
That would have been cool. I have only seen the Force Awakens in theaters
It was very cool. I have seen everyone since Return of the Jedi in the theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I always liked Han Solo.
Yes, he and Chewie make a great pair of characters.
It's too bad he died in The Force Awakens, but that is probably what Harrison Ford wanted.
True - it moved the story along and made Kylo an even more evil character.
Do you think that Kylo will be redeemed by the end of the trilogy?
I don't know - perhaps he and Luke will destroy each other and Rey will be a middle Grey Jedi?
It is possible that they will go that route - I wonder if Rey will make her own lightsaber.
I think that she will continue to use Luke's - maybe she is Luke's daughter!
I hope that John Williams write the music for Episode IX.
Me too - he needs to write some epic music for the final movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think Star Wars never has a solid family unit?
Well, Luke had one in the beginning of Epsiode 6.
Yes, but his family was quickly killed. So was Leia's.
It does seem like parents are always dying, doesn't it?
I can't think of a single family unit that stays together.
They continued the trend in the new movies as well. Anakin leaves his mom and she later dies.
Yes, and Rey doesn't have parents either.
I wonder if maybe its just too hard to let the protagonist run off to adventures if there is someone keeping tabs on them.
That is a valid point, but you would think at least one character would at least have both parents until adulthood.
Technically, Han and Leia both survive until their child is an adult, not that it turns out particularly well for them...
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what I never understood about Star Wars.
What's that?
Why those storm troopers were such horrible shots
Yeah, that's true, they missed a lot.
Yeah, they were supposed to be these highly trained soldiers
Yet they were always missing their targets.
Well except for when they shot Leia at the end of Jedi
I don't remember that one
It was the scene where they were at the shield generator door
Oh yeah, but Han took care of him later.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Rogue One.
Cool.  I've lost count.  Where is this in the chronology?
Just after Star Wars 3.
What happens?
A young woman tries to save her dad, a Death Star designer.
Neat.  Does she succeed?
No, he gets killed.
Too bad.  What else happens?
She gets the schematics to Princess Leia before getting killed.
Tragic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rogue One is my favorite Star Wars film.
Whoa really, even over the original trilogy?
Yeah it manages to capture two themes really well.
What themes are those?
Bleakness and hopefulness, the movie is full of them both.
Oh good thinking, I agree on that.
The fact that they had the courage to actually end the film the way they did, was nothing short of impeccable.
Indeed, a very dark but hopeful ending that paved the way for our heroes in the original trilogy.
I can only hope the next Star Wars spin offs are that good.
Honestly with Disney at the helm, I can't see that being anything but the case.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the name of the first Star Wars movie?
The first movie in the series or the first movie that was made?
What was the first movie that they made?
Episode IV: A New Hope.
What was the name of the first movie in the series?
Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Why do you think they start at Episode IV?
I read that the director, George Lucas, felt that the script worked better starting from Episode IV.
That's an odd choice to make.
Yeah, but it worked so well!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite part of Star Wars?
Well I guess I could say that the prequel movies aren't as good as the original trilogy, but that's a bit obvious.
Well yeah
I don't know. Maybe the Ewoks?
The Ewoks? Why?
Just felt like they never really fit. Like George Lucas just injected some teddy bears into the series to sell more toys, or something.
Now I kinda liked them. I wasn't obsessed with them or anything, but I liked some of their antics.
Well you were a lot younger when that movie came out than I was.
I guess. I suppose they definitely have a different feel than the rest of the series up to that point.
Yeah I never bothered checking out any of those Ewok spinoff movies. I had enough of them the first time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which character in the recent Star Wars movies did you like better? Rey or Jyn Erso?
That's a tough question. I really like both Daisy Ridley and Felicity Jones and both characters Rey and Jyn went through so much as children.
I think Jyn went through more. She basically was broken and angry, where I think Rey accepted her life and made the most out of it.
That's kind of true. I can see Rey less broken and just along for the ride and then learning about herself, while Jyn basically had her parents taken away from her and was battling a cause that was beyond her skills.
Don't forget Rey has the Force, she just doesn't know it yet. So in essence she has a guiding power that is watching over her. Jyn is a pretty normal human. Her courage and her bravery is what sets her apart from everyone else.
You make a compelling argument for Jyn there, so I'm guessing you like Jyn from Rogue One better than Rey from Force Awakens.
I like them both! They've been my favorite modern Star Wars characters to date.
Sad we won't get more Jyn.
Well we have Rey to look forward to, but I think Jyn definitely solidifies my ranking for her as my favorite character between those too but Rey still has a series to go to catch up for me!
I can't wait for the follow up to Force Awakens. The reveal with Luke Skywalker at the end of Force Awakens was so exciting and surprising!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite original Star Wars movie?
Personally, mine is Empire Strikes Back.
Is there any reason why?
To me, it has the strongest story and script of all the movies. It's paced extremely well, it expands so well on what the original set up
That does make a lot of sense
Also  it has the strongest opening and closing to a Star Wars film,
Yeah not to mention that be revelation at the end
Yeah nobody even saw that coming!
It really is a great part of the original series
I would say its one of the best of the whole series.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, it's impressive how real the space fights looked in the original Star Wars, considering the time.
Yeah, it is. How did they even do them?
I think they used model figurines and really tricky photography.
Surely they don't still.
No, I'm sure they use plenty of CGI now.
CGI would make that a lot easier.
Yeah. The Millennium Falcon looks a lot more realistic now in The Force Awakens.
It really does, but it feels like something's missing.
Something's missing?
Yeah. I might be alone, but I miss the campiness of the first movies!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in Star Wars?
Luke Skywalker.
How come he is your favorite?
Because he is a Jedi Master.
But aren't there other Jedi Masters in the prequels?
Yes, but in the original movies, we got to see Luke grow in the force.
Do you think Rey can also become a Jedi Master?
Of course because the force is strong in her.
Do you think she is related to Luke?
I sure hope so because that would make the next sequels very interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to Han Solo: A Star Wars Story next year?
I'm so excited about it! They just announced Ron Howard will direct it!
I'm looking forward to seeing how Alden Ehrenreich will do as Han! Emilia Clarke is also going to be in there along with Woody Harrelson and Donny Glover although their characters haven't been revealed yet!
Alden's really good! I saw him in Hail, Caeser with George Clooney and he's really talented. I can't wait to see what he does as Han Solo!
I'm really interested to see what direction they take this. I'm not sure where I understand the timeline.
I think I recall that it's going to be set before he gets frozen in the carbonite.
So that's probably setting place in the time before he meets Jabba the Hut.
I believe so! But you know, they always change things up. So for now that's what I'm going with.
We'll have Chewbacca! You also know the Millennium Falcon will be there! So, I'll be excited for all of this!
We have to wait until next May the 25th of 2018 for it, but it should come around quick!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars droid?
C3-PO for sure.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, I really like his back story.
How do you mean?
The actor inside the suit also voiced the character.
So?
They were going to have a voice actor do it.
Huh....
But Lucas like the actor's voice so much, he just had him do it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read somewhere that the first Star Wars movie was based on classic mythology.
Yeah, Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth details the elements of classic myth, and Star Wars (I don't call it A New Hope, that's for youngsters) hits all of them.
I think the classic myth elements are what made it such a strong story. You can't beat story structure that's been used for 3000 years, right?
Read Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces and the parallels become really obvious. A young hero called to adventure, training with a Mentor, going on a journey.
This is great stuff. And Lucas modernized the hero myth in order to reach a 20th century audience in a visual medium.
Exactly. I remember when the film first came out. It was such a sensation - it played in theaters for over a year, which in this day and age would be amazing, unbelievable.
Yeah, that was back in the days when there weren't DVDs and Netflix rentals.
I must have seen the movie in a theater over a dozen times, because it was so entertaining. Heck, I saw it two times in a row the first time I saw it - I hid in the bathroom between showings and went right back in for the second go round.
I think it really changed the way science fiction was presented in movies. Everybody wanted to do a Star Wars type film.
Even the second trilogy wanted to be the first trilogy, in the sense of setting a precedent, awe and wonder. But Lucas tried to do it with special effects instead of a good solid story, which is why the prequel trilogy sucked so hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite moment where someone uses The Force?
I love in Episode III when Yoda throws his lightsaber into a clone trooper.
Yeah, we've never seen that before--their hands had to always be on the button.
Yours?
Probably when Kylo Ren stops a blaster bullet in mid-air.
More than Vader stopping them in Empire?
Far more.
Why?
Well, Vader let them hit his hand. Kylo caught it, had a conversation, kept it steady, and released it when he wanted to.
That was pretty sweet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder how much more of Supreme Leader Snoke's back story we'll get.
Yeah, no explination in the first.
There's gotta be some history there.
I wonder if he now the Emperor.
I'd imaging there is some connection.
Has to be.
At any rate, they have a lot of explaining to do.
Ha! They don't have to do anything.
Well, we'll find out soon.
Not soon enough!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if they'll do anymore Star Wars spin offs.
Me too. I hope so.
Yeah, that'd be good.
There were a few before Rogue One.
There were?
Well, maybe just one.
Which one?
I remeber a movie based on Ewoks.
Really?
Yeah. I can't remeber the name. I saw it when I was a kid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about what happened with the Han Solo movie?
No what happened with the Han Solo movie?
Kathleen Kennedy fired the directors working on the Han Solo movie?
Really? Why? They were already shooting the film!
The directors were removed due to creative differences.
Wow! So who is the director now?
The new director is Ron Howard, it was just announced today.
Ron Howard, I would not have expected that at all.
Its not a complete surprise. Prior to filming Episode I, he was one of three directors that George Lucas asked to help direct Episode 1.
Neat, I never expected Ron Howard to be a Star Wars fan. Hopefully, this won't affect the release date for the movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You've seen the Star Wars movies right?
Of course I have, who hasn't?
Who is your favorite character of the original three?
I would have to say Lea.
Interesting, why is that?
To this day I still remember seeing that hologram say "Help me, Obi-Won Kanobi.  You're my only hope.
That was an exciting moment in the series.
Who was your favorite.
Yoda, when he said "Do or do not, there is no try".  Was my favorite moment.
People still use that today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many of the Star Wars movies have you seen so far?
I have seen all of them!
Even the cartoon ones?
No.  I guess I have only seen all of the blockbuster ones.
Which one was your favorite?
I loved Empire Strikes Back!  It was so intense.
I kind of liked Rogue One, Just because it was a break from the old story a little bit.
I loved that story too!  Especially the romance parts.
Diego Luna is definitely a good looking guy, his accent is fabulous.
Felicity Jones was awesome as well in that movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would a Palpatine backstory be a good stand alone movie?
Yes it would, I'd like to see how he trained, and how he manipulated the Senate from his perspective.
He did a masterful job of destroying the Jedi from within.  He deserves more screen time.
I agree, he was the most powerful character, except maybe Yoda in the whole story.
Yeah, I wish they had more battles.  That was a clash of titan in Revenge of the Sith.
I'd also like to see more Darth Maul.
Yes, he needed more screen time.  He was one of the few high points from Episode One.
Him and the improved fight scenes.
I agree on that, even though the original movies were far better made the fight scenes took a huge leap forward in the prequels.
That and the continuity, they were more consistent in the prequels.  Just not as well written.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How great of a character was Yoda
He was inspirational for many people.
I think that he should not have died.
Well some of the story would not make sense then.
He was wise but I think that it would keep going.
Do you think a Yoda reprise is in the works?
I think they will come out with a similar character but not actually name it Yoda.
You would think it could exist in some manner.
I think eventually you will see flashbacks.
With today's technology it should not be a problem.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I always thought Carrie Fisher was beautiful, but I really loved seeing her blossom as the original trilogy progressed.
Yes, she had a young fresh beauty - and a lot of sass, of course - in Star Wars, and then she just got better.
Of course she had better hair after Star Wars, ha. The double bun is iconic and distinctive, but the braids wound around her head were a lot more attractive.
As you watch, you keep being reminded how tiny she was. She was small next to Harrison Ford, and she was just dwarfed next to Peter Mayhew, who played Chewie.
Everyone was dwarfed next to Peter Mayhew.
The scenes between her and Darth Vader, black vs white, good vs evil, tall vs tiny, were very dramatic.
I thought she was her most beautiful in Return of the Jedi. Great costuming.
Are you talking about the slave outfit Leia wore when she was with Jabba the Hutt?
Well sure, she looked amazing in that. But even the workday uniform she wore on the Ewok planet was really nice. And the scenes with her long, long hair all loose, just beautiful.
I'm so sorry she's gone, but it's great that we have these films to remember her by.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the Jedi?
They were great in Attack of the Clones
They were the central part of the movies
I wouldn't mind the movies being just about them
There was some politics and a bunch of fighting
Did you like the lightsaber duels?
Some of them were cool.
I felt bad for the Jedi in episode 3
they didn't rebuild what they had after that
That was sad
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm so excited about the next Star Wars movie!
Oh yeah! What's this one called again?
It's episode 8 and it's called The Last Jedi!
Is Luke Skywalker supposed to be in it more this time?
Oh yeah. He's is shown in the trailer training and teaching Rey.
Are all the other characters from The Force Awakens supposed to be back?
Poe, Finn, BB-8, Phasma, Kylo, and so more are all in the trailer plus some new faces.
I wonder if we will find out why Luke was on that island.
I bet we will. The teaser trailer shows Rey exploring some ancient Jedi texts.
It sounds like they are going in to the unexplored history of the Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is George Lucas involved in the next Star Wars movies?
You mean writing the script?
I mean anything at all.  Does he have say over what's going on?
Not really.  I'm sure they tell him what they're doing, but since he sold the property, he probably lacks some oversight.
Which is probably okay since he kind of butchered the prequels.
No kind of about it, he did butcher them.
I wonder how much he makes from these films.
Enough to build a large bank vault that he can swim in.
Like Scrooge McDuck, right?
Exactly.  George Lucas doesn't strike me as a swimmer though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
What's Star Wars?
WHAT'S STARWARS!?  SERIOUSLY!?
ummm...
YOUVE REALLY NEVER SEEN STAR WARS!?
Nah, I'm just playing!
Oh, you so had me! So what's your fav character?
Yoda
Niiiiiiice!
Thanks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I thought Liam Neeson was in Star Wars, but I guess not.
No, he was in some of the movies.
Which one or ones?
I know he was in the Phantom Menace for sure.
He was Obi-Wan, right?
Oh no, Anakin hadn't befriended him at the time.
Then what was his name?
Qui-Gon Jinn I think.
Man, I remember nothing about his character to be honest.
He was kind of a boring Jedi honestly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Harrison Ford originally wasn't going to be in the series?
You mean he wasn't first choice for Han Solo?
Apparently, they wanted Burt Reynolds to be the guy.
That's just crazy to think about.  Who else was under consideration?
Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson, even Christopher Walken.
Now that would have been something to seen Walken do it.
It's hard to imagine anyone being Han except Ford.
Arguably his most iconic screen character.
He made a wise financial decision, that's for sure.
Does he get royalties?  If so, my goodness, he must be loaded.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like yoda?
what type of question is that?
a basic question
everybody likes yoda
did you like him in the old films or the newer one
the graphics are much better now
they really are
technology is crazy
and the new one is all digital too
no actors needed
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a good or bad guy in most cases?
Well depends on what my choices of side are
Okay lets make this interesting
How shall we do that
Okay what if it is sith or jedi?
Well then i would pick sith
Why is that
Because red is so much a cooler color
That is such a lame and simple reason.
But it is my reason man
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?
Yes I've seen them all.  Who do you think Rey's father is?
I'm not sure? Maybe she is Kylo Ren's twin?
Wouldn't that be a great twist!
Yes, but I also saw an interview where they had her name listed as Rey Kenobi.
Well, that could have been someone's wishful thinking.
True.  We will know more when the next movie comes out.
It's fun to speculate though.
Yes, it is.  Maybe she is Luke's daughter?
Possibly, that would be too obvious though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
I like Luke Skywalker
Oh, so typical!
You think?
Yea, everyone says Luke!
Oh, then what's yours?
R2-D2
Why, he's boring!
He's underrated
I see now
XXXXXXXXXXX
When was the last time you watched the original Star Wars trilogy?
I watched it a few weeks ago with my daughter.
Which was her favorite movie?
She liked Return of the Jedi best.
I bet she thought the Ewoks were cute.
She loved the Ewoks, and the big celebration at the end of the movie.
I never liked Return of the Jedi. My favorite was always A New Hope.
Why did you like that one?
I just liked how it brought me into this brand new universe.
I know what you mean. I loved it when Darth Vader first walks on-screen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Darth Maull's saber was the best.
It was pretty wicked looking!
He was a wicked looking dude!
Too true.
I wonder how he was recruited.
How do the Sith recruit?
Probably issue a draft.
You are such a nerd.
Maybe they can sense the Dark Side.
Most definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest start wars movie?
Was that Rogue One?
I think so, yeah.`
No. I actually have only seen one of the movies.
Which one was that?
I'm not actually sure. But it had those cute little fuzzy animals in it!
Oh! You mean the Ewoks!
Yeah!
I think that was Episode IV, but it might have been Episode III.
I'm not really a huge star wars fan, but I did like that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the cheesiest part of the old Star Wars movies?
I think its funny when they go to that jazz club
Oh yeah the music was really weird
do you remember one alien playing the saxophone? What the heck!
That was a funny scene. Another funny thing was when they are getting squished in the trash compactor
And they try to stop the machine with a long pole?
yeah that's the scene!
On top of getting squished there was a huge snake in ther too!
Yeah that was so random!
makes me feel grateful for the newer movies! Better acting and better plots!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember seeing Star Wars when it first came out.
I was only 3.
The lines were huge.
I heard it was a big success.
It was groundbreaking.
Now the special effects seem cheesy.
The musical score was a big part of the success.
Scored by Williams?
Of course C3PO and R2D2 stole the show!
I do love Droids!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember the first time I saw Star Wars. It blew my mind!
Me, too. I thought the light saber fight was great.
I think my favorite in the franchise is the Empire Strikes Back.
Yea, that is good, but I liked Return of the Jedi best.
It is not all great, though. Remember Jar Jar Binks?
Oh, what a terrible character! What were they thinking?
My favorite character is Han Solo. Ford did a great job.
Yeah, I liked Han, but I really liked Yoda. That little guy could be tough.
It was amazing what they could do with puppets!
Even when the puppets were goofy looking aliens, they still were entertaining.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you heard the theory about Rey?
You're going to have to be more specific; pretty much everyone has a theory about Rey.
I mean the one where Obiwan is Rey's father.
What? How would that work?
The idea is that Obiwan got married on Tatooine and then had Rey really close to the end of his time.
I don't know if that timeline works out.
Well, she could be his grandchild then!
Why do you want it to be Obiwan?
The series has always been about a Kenobi and a Skywalker, imo. It'd be so much better to keep it that way than to make it about one family.
And just have it be about friendship instead? I can see the merit in that, I guess.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever seen Return of the Jeti?
Is that a Star Wars movie?
Yeah, it's one of the older ones.
When did it come out?
I'm not sure, before I was born.
I think I might have seen it.
Which ones have you seen then?
I saw the one where Luke fights DarthVader.
You mean when he gets his hand cut off?
Yeah, that's the one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why were Luke and Leia sent to different families on different planets after Padme's death?
To make it more difficult for Darth Vader to find them.
But Darth Vader, or Anakin was their father.
Yes, but remember Aaikin killed all the Jedi children when he turned to the dark side.
So you think he would have killed his own children?
Yes.  He had turned completely to the dark side.
But Vader rejected the dark side at the end of "Return of the Jedi".
Yes, but when Luke and Leia were born, he would have killed them if he could find them.
Probably so.
Defiantly so.  That is why Kenobi hid them from him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Chewie was a Wooki, right?
Yes he was .
The why are all the wookies on Return of the Jedi so small?
Those were ewoks, unrelated to wookies I think.
So in one of the prequel, was Chewie in one of them
Yes, I do believe he was mentioned by name, or at least refered to.
So was he on screen and did he have lines, ha,ha!
I think we was on screen.
Did have that sash around his shoulder yet?
Yes, it looked the same as always.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you see the Force Awakens?
Yeah, I did.
Cool, did you have any problems with it?
Well, I thought the whole Solo's son goes bad was a little unoriginal, I mean the old Expanded Universe did the same thing with Jacen Solo.
True, true. I always thought that was kind of hokey and unnessecary.
Yea, I mean what is Solo-Skywalker clan cursed or something, every generation someone seems to go to the dark side., whether owned by DIsney or not.
That's about the size of it, any other issues?
Well, I didn't like them killing off Han Solo, but at least they did it well.
That's true and think about it, Harrison Ford is a really big name in movies, so he's probably pretty expensive to have.
True, his career took off after Star Wars, but Mark Hamil didn't do nearly as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What Star Wars movies do you think are the best not counting the first three that came out in the series?
Of the newer movies made in 1999 to present you mean?
Yes, not those in the original trilogy.
I thought Episode III: Return of the Sith was the best one.
It did have the best story line.
And it really put together in understanding a lot in the original trilogy.
Like where Darth Vadar came from.
And why he was in that black suit.
I liked The Force Awakens as well.
I think that one is up there too in the newer movies I like the new characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a favorite Star Wars scene?
Oh my, I have many. The first one that comes to mind is from The Empire Strikes Back.
Hmm, the Luke storyline with Yoda, or the Leia/Han storyline?
Leia and Han. That scene in the cockpit when Han corners Leia and makes her all uncomfortable.
That was a great scene. I loved it when she called him a scoundrel, and he took it as a compliment.
Isn't that just like a charming scoundrel?
And right when things were getting interesting, here comes Threepio to interrupt.
After Han realized Leia had slipped away, I thought Han was going to strangle "Goldenrod" right then and there.
Threepio has such a way of...getting in the way.
Anthony Daniels played him perfectly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Leia is a Jedi?
Doesn't she have to be?
Well, being Force sensitive doesn't automatically make you a Jedi.
Force Awakens was the only movie in which Leia doesn't use a weapon.
But, that's because she didn't need to.
What if it's because her weapon is now a lightsaber, and that's the big reveal for Last Jedi?
That would be amazing, and would explain why Carrie had to get into shape.
And, Luke had plenty of time to train her if Force Awakens is 30 years later, and her son is in his 20s.
Do you think they will kill her character in Last Jedi?
If they do, it better be in an amazing lightsaber battle.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you know they're working on more star wars movies?
Oh yeah, I'm excited.
Yeah me too.
Ever since Disney got the franchise they have been kicking them out.
Wait disney owns star wars now?
Yeah that's right.
What happened to george lucas?
He sold it to disney for a few billion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think they'll do in The Last Jedi?
I think Kylo and Rey will have to team up to stop Luke.
Are you kidding, then who is the bad guy?
Luke turns bad and they try to turn him good, Snope is also a bad guy.
That makes no sense, Luke would never turn bad.
Well bad is relative, I'm sure he thinks he's doing good by ridding the world of Jedi.
Regardless, he's training Rey and Kylo and Ren wouldn't be powerful enough to stop Luke.
That might be a flaw in my idea, but flaws haven't stopped them before.
I think Kylo goes full dark-side and it's an epic battle between him and Rey, who ditches her teacher like and goes to fight too early.
Maybe, they copied Star Wars, might as well copy Empire Strikes Back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Han Solo?
In the old movies or in the newer ones?
What's the difference?
Well he is a lot older when he fights with Rey, he was young before
I guess I like him more in the older movies
Why do you say that?
He was funnier and cuter!
My mom thinks he is still cute! That's so funny!
I think he was sassier and more sarcastic in the older ones
Oh, I dont really like that, personally!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite Star Wars movie?
Episode I.  That was awful.
Oh come on.  I agree it was the weakest but awful?
Ok it had it's high points.
Yeah like seeing the start of Darth Vader as an innocent kid.
Yeah, or revealing he has more raw power than anyone.
We also learned a lot about Jedi, even if it wasn't perfect.
Yeah, you're right about that.
Plus Darth Maul had the best fight scene.
Yeah, that was amazing.  Too bad they killed him off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your least favorite Star Wars movie?
That would have to be The Phantom Menace, as it just failed to deliver an interesting story line.
Yeah, I agree and it was just ridiculous when they introduced Jar-Jar. I mean who likes that character?
Jar-Jar was such an unnecessary character, but I liked how they introduced the concept of a Grey Jedi.
Qui-Gon Jinn was perhaps the only redeeming character in that movie.
That and the epic fight scene between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul.
I really enjoyed that fight scene and the music that accompanied it was awesome.
Do you ever wish that they would make a movie more dedicated to the Sith and their origins?
It would be interesting for sure, as there is so much mystery surrounding the Sith.
Hopefully we will get to see something in the future.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the first set of Star Wars movies, or the recent ones best?
The first set, because they had better story lines.
Yes, me too.  I think there was a lot better development of the characters.
The element of using "The Force" was way cool, too.
It was almost kind of like what passes for religious beliefs these days.
Yeah, in the older movies they treated it that way, but in the newer movies they treat it more like they are a police force rather than a religion.
There were better action scenes, even without the improved special effects they have today.
There was nothing like it back then, they were way ahead of their time.
Well, I guess it's true, can't beat old school storytelling.
Yeah, these days it's like all they can come up with is remakes, nothing original any more like the original Star Wars!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So did you see Rogue One?
Oh, no, let's not talk about that movie.
You didn't like it?
It was just so sad, everyone died at the end!
Well, yeah, but they completed their mission!
Lots of people complete their missions without dying!
That's true, but they never showed up in the other films so they had to die.
I guess so, but couldn't just one of them had lived? Ride off into the sunset and never return?
I don't know, I think the sacrifice was more powerful this way. And Leia didn't die!
The tie in to the next movie was pretty cool, but I still think it was too sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which do you like more, the Star Wars original trilogy or the prequel trilogy?
Of course my choice is the original trilogy!
I also like the original trilogy more!
I can't believe they even released the prequel in the first place!
I know, it was so bad!
I think the only thing good about the prequel was Obi Wan Kenobi.
I agree with you!
I was also not a fan of Anakin Skywalker.
The only good thing about Anakin Skywalker was when he turned to the dark side.
My favorite scene was when Anakin got rid of the younglings.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about the Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope movie?
I loved that movie when i was a kid.
I know i must have watched it over 50 times growing up.
Seeing a young Mark Hamill develop into the Luke Skywalker character was great.
Yeah they found the right face for the job.
I gotta say though Harrison Ford playing Solo is my favorite character in the movie.
I always thought they should have gave Han Solo a stand alone movie.
That would be cool, like an origin movie on how he met Chewy.
I would pay to see that in the theater for sure.
They just need to find the right person to stand in for Harrison Ford.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a question about Star Wars that has been bugging me for a while.
What is it?
Why didn't Chewbacca get a medal at the end of the first movie?
Wow, that's an excellent question.
He should have gotten one for helping blow up the Death Star.
Especially because both Han and Luke got medals.
Chewie played just a big a role as the other two.
Does this imply that they consider Chewie as second class?
I think there are a few Wookiees on Kashyyyk that would take offense.
Also by that logic, I think the droids should have received medals too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think they should release the original unaltered version of Star Wars?
Yes, because all you can see now are the special editions.
Yeah, I want to see it when it was just Star Wars and not A New Hope.
I doubt people know that it was originally released not as Episode 4.
The original is much different than the new updated ones.
Yes, there is the werewolf in the space port scene and so many other things.
Also, there was no Jabba.
Yes, the movie works much better without him.
What is your favorite scene in the first movie?
The R2-D2 scene where he gets captured.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw "Star Wars" episode I thru 111 with a friend.
Wow, that is cool, did you like it?
Yes!  I am a fan of all the Star Wars episodes.
Yeah! me too,I like "Revenge of the Sith", Empire Strikes Back"and all the other great episodes.
Did you know Carrie Fisher was only 21 when she played in the first Star Wars?
No!, I did not know she was so young.
I like princess Leia, she was a very tough lady in Star Wars?
Yeah, she was not afraid of anything.
Harrison Ford is great in the Star Wars movies too.
The best part of the "Star Wars movies is the great special effects.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was General Grievous a Sith warrior?
Not quite.  He was just trained in certain Sith aspects, but he wasn't a Sith.
But he was trained by Count Dooku, wasn't he?
He was, but as mentioned in the previous movie, there can only be two Sith.
Oh, a master and apprentice, right?
That's correct.
Even if he wasn't Sith, I think Grievous was pretty interesting.
He had biologic parts, which is probably why he was Force sensitive.
Do you think he was a better villain than Count Dooku?
With that, I'd disagree.  Christopher Lee did such a terrific job portraying the Count.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new Story episode.
I actually really liked it.  It was better than I was expecting.
I loved K2SO.  I thought he was great!
He had the most memorable lines in the movie.
He was funnier than C3P0 but still had that robotness about him.
I liked Jyn as well.  I have liked the new female leads that have been in the new movies.
In a weird way I liked the fact that all of them died at the end.  The good guys don't always have to survive.
I knew that's what was going to happen since none of those characters are in episode 4.
They threw in some connections to episode 4 like when they bumped into the ugly guys from the cantina.
I thought the overall connection between episode 3 and 4 was done pretty well.  Though CGI Leia was a little weird at the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into the star wars movies at all?
Oh yeah totally!
That is great, what is your favorite character?
I love Chewy because he is so adorable.
Yeah he is adorable and funny as well.
I also like Yoda.
Yoda is very wise.
I hate the emperor.
I think everyone hates the emperor, he is completely evil.
He is worse than Vader.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you like the Star Wars world?
Yeah I love it.
Oh cool  You a big fan?
Yeah I really do love Star Wars.
What would you say to somebody that said Star Trek was better.
Well first I would laugh.
and then.
I don't know, probably just keep laughing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who are Rey's parents?
If it's a character we've already met, there are only so many options.
Yeah, so who do you think it is?
Well, we know she's not Han's or Leia's daughter. I think they would have known.
She could be Luke's.
Yeah, I suppose she could be. But again, wouldn't Leia know if Luke had gone off and had a kid?
Maybe Luke didn't even know.
That seems very Un-Star Wars like.
Granted. So who's Rey daddy?
Based solely on her English Accent, Ben Kenobi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Rogue One?
Yeah, it was awesome.
I think it may have been in my top 3 favorite Star Wars movies.
Me too!
It fills in one of the biggest plot holes of the series.
Oh yeah?  And what is the biggest plot hole?
That you would build the ultimate space station, capable of easily destroying a planet that can be blown up so easily.
You know, I never thought about that but its true.
It just doesn't make sense.
You're right, man.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which side would you be on in the Star Wars movies?
I would be with the Rebel Alliance of course.  You?
I would too and not only that, I would have jedi skills.
I would fly the Millenium Falcon.
With Han Solo!  Hey, what do you think about the new movie about him they are making?
I hope it will be done right.  They need to use old school Star Wars stuff and not this new movie ideas.
InIIn that Star Wars Movie where he died I watched the lead girl and she,without any training at all, could fly ships and fight with light sabers.
I know! That made no sense at all!
Luke had to be trained and in real life anyone would need training.
That's why I say they need to use old school Star Wars movies ideas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When I was twelve I was in love with Luke Skywalker. You know, Mark Hamill.
You're kidding! I mean, look how old her is now!
Ahem....how old am I? Please I'm talking about the year 1977!
Okay, you were in love with Mark (scoff) Hamill. Tell me more about that.
He was so young, and cute, and had heaps of pretty straight blonde hair, a forked chin, dimples, and the bluest eyes ever....
What about Harrison Ford? Don't tell me he's chopped liver.
No, by no means, but when I was 13, he seemed just a little too mature for me. As I grew up, though...he started looking much more appetizing.
So did you ever meet him? What about conventions and stuff?
I never had the gall to go to cons when he was starring,nor did I have the money. I did see him in Penn Station once, when he was directing a Broadway Play, and I was too scared to speak with him.
Wow, talk about being star-crossed. Maybe Chewbacca is a little more approachable.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your theory has to who Rey is?
Perosnally, I think she's the daughter of two Jedi that broken the rules.
Yeah, the whole " No attachments thing".
Yeah, so they were expelled from the Order, so they missed being caught in the Purge.
So, why did they have Rey and then leave her on Jakku?
Because, even after the fall of the Empire, they were in danger.
From who?
Snoke and the early First Order, I think he was hunting for Rey because of her strength, so her parent left her in the most out of the way place they could find and disappeared.
Oh, so that's how Kylo Ren seemed to know something about her?
Yes, Snoke told him about her, so that he'd recognize her if he ever ran into her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
All but the latest one.
I haven't seen that one either, I was going to ask if you thought it was good.
I heard it was really good and I want to see it.
Do you want to watch Star Wars The Force Awakens together?
Yes, I would like that.
What do you think it's about?
I'm not sure I heard it's quite a few years in the future after Luke and Vader.
I wonder if any notable characters will be in it?
I'm sure some will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember when the first Star Wars movie came out?
I think it was in 1977.
Was it really that long, I feel old now.
Don't feel bad we all do.
George Lucas made the films, correct?
Yes he did and he did a great job, I believe he was young when he made them too.
Do you think he thought they would become as popular as they did?
I doubt it, who could imagine creating the greatest franchise in all of entertainment.
Do you think he dreamed up this world when he was a kid?
I do, imagine a kid around 10 their imagination is at it's peak.  Anything is possible at that age.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, do you think Disney will drive our love for SW into the ground?
I'm not excited about all these spin-offs
On paper, it seems cool to have things divert from the story/rules of the franchise
Right. But Rogue One was basically a prequel
That was so disappointing. Shades of Dirty Dozen but overwhelmed by tying in it
That is the problem, Disney. All those reshoots rumors
Yeah, they probably just used the reshoots to tie it into the franchise
I don't care to see young Han Solo. I'd love for complete stand-alone stories
Like?
A Mace Windu story would be awesome. Or, I mean, Vader's hunt of the Jedi. We got a tiny taste in Rogue One
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
Return of the Jedi for sure!
Mine too! There are so many cool parts in that one.
What is your favorite part?
Of course it's when Princess Leia is held captive by Jabba the Hutt.
Whew! That is good, but I like when Luke gets trained by Yoda.
Train you, I will!
I love that little green creature. He can fight too!
Do you think they'll ever finish that saga?
I sure hope not.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who would make really cool jedi knights?
Jay and Silent Bob?
Exactly, they would be the coolest dudes in the galaxy. Cooler than Han.
You got that idea from their movie.
Oh shucks, you're right. Forgot about that.
It is a good idea though.
Yeah, Silent Bob would look really cool all cloaked up with a light saber.
Sure, I mean the dude already wears a trenchcoat all the time.
Now Jay would have to be the jedi stricken between the light and the dark side of the force.
Most definitely, he'd play that fringe type of character, unpredictable and exciting yet torn with a good heart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your take on the music in Star Wars?
I like a lot of it.
What's your favorite?
Darth Vader's theme.  Suits him.
A little heavy handed for sure.
And then I'm pretty sure there's a theme for Luke. Its a little dramatic but I like it.
I think I know the one you mean.
Then in the Force Awakens, I like Rey's theme.
I vividly remember that. Kind of striking and pretty.
It was intended to demonstrate some aspects of her personality.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bet you can't guess who voiced BB-8?
A sound board....
Bill Hader!
From SNL?
One and the same.
I can't belive it. Why did they need a voice?
Couldn't tell you, but that's pretty cool, huh?
Very!
They had so many cameos in that movie.
That's what I heard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey did you catch The Force Awakens?
The new Star Wars movie? Yeah I saw it in the theater
What did you think about them killing off Han Solo?
I mean he was pretty old, so it wasn't as big of a deal. I really like Han, and I'm upset that he died, but it made for a good story
Yeah it did. And how great was Adam Driver as Kylo Ren?
He's fantastic, and I totally didn't see that twist coming
Do you think Rey will convinve him to come to the light side?
I don't know. I think he might have a better chance of getting her to join the Dark Side.
Really? What makes you think she'd do that?
Rey seemed really angry, and resentful about her parents abandoning her. We still don't know who her parents are, so they could be related for all we know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the funniest line from any of the Star Wars movies?
I'll go with "Let the Wookiee Win".
That's a great one!
I also think Darth Vader had some good lines in Rogue One.
For sure! "Be careful not to choke on your aspirations."
Its up there with the classic "I find your lack of faith disturbing".
And "You have failed me for the last time".
I like the humor and sarcasm/sass, I think it fits the character well.
It was great to see Vader at the end of the movie, attacking and going all out.
Definitely. A moment long time fans wanted for years and they delivered!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am excited for the next Star Wars movie. Do you think Luke is the last Jedi from the title?
Jedi could also be plural and could be referring to several characters.
True, I hadn't thought of that. I hope we will find out who Snoke is.
I think it would be funny if it turned out Snoke was really tiny in real life and his giant hologram was just him compensating for that.
Yeah, we'll see. I do have a lot of faith in the director Rian Johnson that he made a good movie.
I liked The Force Awakens but I felt it stuck a little too close to the old Star Wars formulas. I hope the next one has more surprises and fewer Death Stars.
It will also be sad to see Carrie Fisher on screen after her death.
Apparently she wanted Princess Leia to be featured in the 9th movie so it's a shame she didn't get to see that happen.
It is amazing we will be getting new Star Wars movies each year for the foreseeable future.
You said it. I never would have imagined this a few years ago when George Lucas was in charge.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you seen The original release of Star Wars Episode 4?
Which version?
The one where Han shot first.
Oh you mean the original release before George Lucas Added all the extra computer graphics?
Yes.  I really miss the original version.  I feel it made the star wars universe more believable.
Yeah I really love that part where Luke gets a kiss from Leia on the cheek for luck.
I always thought that was weird because they were brother and sister.
What's really weird is when ObiWan denies ever owning a R2 unit.
Yeah once you watch the prequels, you realize what a liar ObiWan was.  He doesn't seem like the most moral Jedi.
The jedi were never really about morality.  If they were moral they wouldn't use the Jedi Mind tricks to lie and manipulate people to get what they want.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's all about carrying a story though, and the prequels do it superbly.
That's an arguable point. Some may say the premise is boring and executed poorly
What?!?! Where do you even... I don't even kniow what that means. Excuted poorly? How?
Where did Darth Maul come from? Where was he born? How was he trained?
From that planet. With those demon witch women. Whatever they are.
But that's the story line from the TV animation series. We're not told this in the prequel.
No. This is true, but that doesn't mean it's executed poorly.
That's what it means exactly. The character development is a very impoirtant part of making a movie.
I guess I do agree with that point.
Yes. And Darth Maul just appears out of nowhere, and ttey start fighting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the new digital remastered versions of Star Wars?
They were pretty good, some of the stuff wasn't though.
Like what?
I didn't like that extended Cantina scene on Tattooine, they had an entire new musical number thrown in.
So?  What's wrong with that?
It was just cheesy, you have this 80's quality movie then suddenly you just threw in this high quality dance number with aliens.
I thought it was pretty funny.
You would, you also loved Jar Jar.
Hey man, Jar Jar was a very well developed character.
My point exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, do I hate Ewoks.
Everybody hates Ewoks, you're not alone.
That was an example of where George Lucas led fans astray.
He started getting into the merchandising game with that strategy.
Which I get, movies can make a ton from merchandising.
That being said, he made them too darn cute.
It kind of ruined part of Return of the Jedi to me.
I wouldn't say ruined it, but it could have been so much better.
Probably a good thing he's staying away from the new ones.
Agreed.  He's already gotten his share of creative license.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Bobba Fett the greatest Star Wars character of all time?
Quite possibly. He was really cool looking
Yeah, what was his back story?
Well, they tried to address it in the prequels, but I didn't follow it too much
His dad was the clone for the stormtroopers
Something like that
His death was a little underwhelming
Yeah, I heard some people are trying to say he survived the sarlaac pit
How could he survive that?
Who knows. Maybe he blasted out with his rocket pack.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know what the total box office earnings for all nine of the Star Wars movies has been?
Oh my gosh, it must be a fortune...
OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS. $6,342,000,000.
Wow. And is that just the box office and not all the toys and other products added in there?
Exactly- digital sales, dvd sales and rentals, and VHS sales equalled 5, almost 6 billiion dollars.
Oh my, if only the government had started the Star Wars franchise, they would have been able to pay off all the debt.
Then there's toys, published titles, games, licensing, tv, and merchandise- another 23 almost 24 billion.
That is some insane amounts of money.
You're right though, just think if the government had thought up the Star Wars franchise- the country wouldn't have all this debt.
Maybe not- if they were like my girlfriend, they would spend it as fast as they made it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you seen the new Star Wars movies?
I just did, actually.
What did you think of them?
I really liked them. I feel like they are getting more back to the feel of the originals.
I like them too. I really like the new characters they are developing.
Which is your favorite?
Well I am very interested in Rey's storyline.
Me too, I want to see what happens with her and Luke.
Oh I think that will be a great part of the next movie.
I am so excited to see more of Luke.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi.
Would you consider yourself a fan of Star Wars?
Yeah I would say so.
What is it about them that you like?
I like the sci fi setting and jedis.
That's a good answer.
What about you, what do you like about star wars?
I like the action and the huge scope of the movies.
Yeah I know what you mean.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tell me about some star wars movies you like.
I really like the third one.
Oh really? That is a movie that not a lot of people actually like.
Well I like it.
Why do you like it?
Because it shows the development of Anakin to the dark side.
Wasn't it sad when Padme died?
Oh yeah that was so sad.
Well it was nice talking to you!
Same to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
R2-D2 or BB-8?
That's a hard one.
They are both pretty coo.
I'm going to have to say R2?
Because he's the original?
Probably.
I'm gonna say BB.
Why?
He just added a lot more comic releife.
That's hard to argue with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just binge watched the original three Star Wars movies yesterday.
Really? I think the best of the original three is Empire Strikes back.
No way! Return of the Jedi is the best.
I like parts of Jedi but I think the Ewoks are just dumb.
But they're so cute, I had the whole Ewok village playset when I was a kid.
That's just it, if you saw the movie for the first time when you were an adult the Ewoks just seem so lame.  Suddenly they're on a planet hanging out with teddy bears, it just doesn't make sense.
Oh OK, a giant Wookie is totally fine with you but smaller, cuter ones are stupid?
Well, you are able to get past the weirdness of Chewbacca because he's huge and really tough.
The Ewoks have a complete culture and language, Chewie only ever howls like a dog with his foot caught in a trap.
Yeah, but the bowcaster and the fact that he can rip your arms off if he gets mad totally make up for all that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite Star Wars movie?
I really don't like Star Wars episodes one, two, and three.
Those are the ones I dislike the most as well. They are just too cheesy and gimmicky compared to all the others.
I agree. They are a prequel to the originals, but besides somewhat fitting with the storyline, they're not much like the other movies.
Yeah, I feel the same way! Plus, you know, there are characters like Jar Jar Binks.
Ugh. Yeah, exactly.
Have you seen the newest Star Wars films? What do you think about those?
Yeah, I saw The Force Awakens and Rogue One in theaters. I really liked those!
Me too! I thought those movies were well written and really good! They reminded me a lot more of the original films.
Yeah, it's great that they have awesome female leads in the series again. Plus, Rey, Finn, and Jyn are pretty awesome characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi there.
Do you like Star Wars?
I'm more of a Star Trek guy.
Have you seen all of the Star Wars films?
Yeah I have seen them all.
What is it about Star Wars that you don't like as much as Star Trek?
The story lines are pretty weak in Star Wars?
Really?
Yeah that's what I think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever wondered how many species there are in the entire star wars series?
Yes I have, I'm guessing there's probably over 10,000.
I agree, even in the bar scene in A New Hope shows like 50 different species.
Its really incredible the level of detail they put into that scene with making all those different costumes.
Yeah you don't see that anymore in movies. Now a days they just use editing and visual graphics.
I wish they would make star wars movies like they used to. It was so much more engaging.
Yes it was. Especially how the light sabers looked. I always thought the old light saber fights were cooler than the new ones like in the Clone Wars.
I like the old light sabers too, but I really liked seeing Mace Windu's light saber for the first time. I had never known a jedi could have a purple one.
Yeah his purple light saber was really cool. Its a shame he died later.
Mace Windu will always be remembered though. Especially because he was played by Samuel Jackson.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think would win in a fight between Darth Maul and Darth Vader?
Oh Maul all the way.  He's a far better swordsman than Vader ever was.
No way, Vader would have destroyed Maul with his superior knowledge of the force.  Look at the closing scene of Rogue One.
Maul had plenty understanding of the force.  He was extremely skilled and more aggressive.
Vader destroyed half the Jedi on his own.  He was the strongest bad in the Star Wars saga.
No way, look at the way Darth Maul nearly defeated both Qui Gon and Obi Wan at the same time.
Yeah when Obi Wan was a beginner.  Old Obi Wan would have stomped him in seconds.
I don't know about that.  His double sides light saber was something else.
But I do agree, they were both absolutely awesome.
Yeah, I wish they would have kept Maul for at least one more movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Can i ask something
Sure if you want
Well i want to
Go ahead
Okay well who shot first in star wars
Easy
Who?
Han solo
So you agree with me good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey there.
Hi.
Do you like Star Wars at all?
Yeah sure.
What's the last one you saw?
I saw the force unleashed.
Didn't see rogue one?
No not yet.
You should check it out, it's quite good.
Yeah it's on my to watch list.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Star Wars movies?
Yeah man I love the Revenge of the Sith.
That one isn't so bad, but I hate the rest so badly. Well, aside from the original trilogy.
What the heck, why?
I feel like they ruined then prequels, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi were all masterpieces, from Luke finding out he's force sensitive to him pretending to go with Darth Vader, his father, to the dark side, they were phenomenal.
You're looking at them thru rose-tinted glasses, they were good but the recent ones are much better.
Just because they used more computer doesn't mean they're better.
Well no, but the new characters are great and the stories are more complex and better.
Well, Jar Jar Binks is the worst creation in all of film history, so there's that.
You're just a hater of new things man :(
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think will happen to Kylo Ren in this movie?
Hard to say.  I get the feeling he might not be as bad of a guy as we think.
He might have some qualities that are redeeming, I guess
It will be interesting to get more of his backstory.
On why Leia and Han abandoned him?
Well, the didn't abandon him, but he obviously didn't grow up how they anticipated.
My guess is they start talking about that in this movie and the next one fully comes out with the why.
I'm interested myself.  It's one of the character narratives we don't understand quite yet.
Only another six months or so to find out!
Yep, can't wait!
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you ever done a star wars marathon?
in one day?! no man, that's too much!
it's pretty hard core, i can't lie. you have to basically not eat and sleep
but is it worth it?
oh yeah! watching in the proper order is always worth it
what's the best movie, though?
the force awakens, honestly
wow, poser
hey! it was good. you can't blame me for liking something more modern
i guess, but c'mon. what bout revenge?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Rey being a feminist hero?
I love her but they went overboard.
Don't be misogynist. Why?
Well, I love strong women. But they force-fed it and it wasn't natural.
Example?
"Stop taking my hand!" while letting him take her hand and not letting go.
Hmm, go on.
"Get off!" when he climbs on her. Why did Finn climb on her to get a view in a plane?
That was a bit forced, I'll admit.
Told you. I'm right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hope they give Snoke a good backstory and motivation, Star Wars movies aren't always good at that.
What about Darth Vader? He's a villain with a good backstory.
Yeah, that's one, and you know what, I'll even throw in Emperor Palpatine, but that's it.
There's gotta be more than that? Tarkin?
He's just a guy who is Vader's superior and runs the Death Star according to the movies.
What about the expanded universe?
Then he's a guy who rose through the ranks of the Republic Military during the Clone Wars, and eventually became governor of the Outer Rim. Not particularly deep.
What about Count Dooku? He was a Jedi idealist who left the Order and went rogue to fight against the corruption in the Republic.
Yeah, and outside of that little tidbit of backstory he's basically just the evil leader of the Separatists. His buddy Grievous is no better.
Okay, I'll give you that. Star Wars is good at making cool villains, but they don't have a lot of depth.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've recently noticed something about the Star Wars films.
What's that?
It seems like they're releasing a new film each year towards the end of the year.
I've noticed that too. It started in 2015 with The Force Awakens, right?
Yeah. Then in 2016 with Rogue One.
What's this years film again?
This year's film is going to be The Last Jedi.
What's it supposed to be about?
It's supposed to revolve more around Luke and Leia, I believe.
Oh, that sounds pretty good so far.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which was the the superior set of Star Wars movies, the original or the requel trilogies?
That's a hard question to answer.
What do you mean?
On one hand, the original movies are groundbreaking and innovative, while the prequels were fairly strong, but not too suprising.
I don't follow you.
I mean, when the original trilogy movies came out, each was fresh and you didn't know what was going next.
Okay, but not the same with the prequels?
Yes, because we knew where everything was going, how we got was put for grabs, but the destination "Darth Vader, the Empire, Death Star" was known.
okay, I see where you're coming from.
Plus, the Phantom, Mence was a little underwhelming.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the original Star War Trilogy, the prequels, or the new films coming out?
I think they all have their bright spots.  I really enjoyed The Rogue One film for example.
What did you like about it?
I enjoyed how the movie went more in depth about the events that happened prior to the first Star Wars film.
It did add a lot of good backstory to things.
Yep.  For example, one of the last scenes where the rebels are trying to escape with the Deathstar plans was amazing.
Watching Darth Vader attempting to get the Deathstar plans while cutting through Rebel soldiers was scary.
I know!  That was probably the most fearsome version of Darth Vader we have seen on screen.
Rogue One ended with a pretty cool nod to A New Hope with the hologram of Princess Leia.
Yep.  It is sad that we won't see more of her in the movies due to Carrie Fischer's passing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the Force Awakens?
It was pretty good.
Did you realize that it is basically the same story as A New Hope?
Yeah it follows the same basic story.
I think that's what made it so good.
It was okay.
Did you atleast like Kylo Ren?
They did that character really well.
I thought it was cool they had Mark Hamill at the end.
I think the next movie in the series is going to be the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
who is stronger than yoda?
i dont know. vader?
vader would beat him...but maybe not, if yoda was in his prime.
yoda would have beaten anakin before he turned  vader.
palpatine kinda beat yoda and left.
i thought it was more of a tie.
he just left yoda literally hanging so i'd think he won.
i wonder what young yoda would have been like.
i wonder if there are actual pictures.
we can check
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars hero from those movies?
Let's see, Jar Jar Binks.
You're kidding right?  How is Jar Jar a hero?
Bear with me. He's a great kid's hero!
Okay, how so?
Despite his fumbling and bumbling misadventures, he kept at it.
He made a lot of mistakes.
True, but he didn't let that stop him.
I remember the way he talked to himself for encouragement.
He did okay!  In the end he got his rewards.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the worst thing about the Star Wars prequels?
I think it was Jar Jar Binks. He was too goofy.
Really? I thought the problems were much deeper than that.
What do you mean?
The characters were all terrible. Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Queen Amidala were flat and had no personality.
Oh, that makes sense. I hadn't thought about it like that.
And furthermore, the plots were boring. There was so much talk about trade routes and the Galactic Senate and other dull things.
Yes, I suppose you're right. The original movies were a classic "hero's journey" arc, but these were a mess.
I think the new sequel trilogy is off to a better start.
I think so, too. I hope they continue to evoke the spirit of the original trilogy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happent to the Bothan spies in Rogue One?
What do you mean.
"Many Bothan spies died, to bring us these plans."
That was Return of the Jedi.
Huh?
Roge One was a prequel to A New Hope.
Oh. That's right.
Yeah. The Bothan spies brought the plans for the second Death Star.
How did I get that mixed up.
I did the same thing, at first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do Han and Leia ever have a child?
Well they cant now
Right but in the time between the 6th and 7th do you think theyll write in they had a child?
Sort of like how Luke found out he was Vader's child?
Exactly, can you see that happening?
It would be too easy of a plot line.
I think Rey would serve as a good one.
I dont think they would pick that low hanging fruit.
Could you see them having a child on the dark side?
That would be more of a probability for this film series
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never understood why Anakin got so upset.
It was a bad part of the first prequels.
It was just silly how bipolar he was.
Yeah.  One moment, he gets mad at the queen, next moment says he can't live without her.
It really hurt the movies how he went back and forth.
And killed any momentum of him being emotionally battered.
Right.  The fact that he killed her still rubs me the wrong way.
They did not film it very well.  It's probably why the prequels are kind of not talked about much.
They'll never remake them, but I wish they did.
Me too.  Can't erase the past though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In Phantom Menace, what did you think about Darth Maul?
He was a good villain but but died too easily. That was a little disappointing.
Yes I thought he was going to be the main villain for the whole trilogy so it was a little surprising that he was killed in the first movie.
They build him up to be this ultimate fighter and extremely powerful but in the end he wasn't so much.
Well to be fair he was fighting against two Jedi knights. That's pretty impressive so I'd say he was extremely powerful.
He even killed Qui-Gon Jinn who was a Jedi master.
He made dumb mistake when he had Obi Wan Kenobi hanging over the pit. He stood there to gloat instead of finishing him off.
Yeah it's hard to believe this skilled warrior would do something so stupid, thus allowing Obi Wan to best him.
Maybe Darth Maul didn't die.
He was cut in half so I think it's safe to say that Darth Maul is dead.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate how the books deviate from the movies so much
I know they do not handle it well it goes from the source material so much
It is like they got the general idea but failed to follow through
Exactly
Their is so much needless exposition too
It just retreads stuff from the movies
It is sort of boring
Pretty much the movies covers the info too
I know i wish that they put the good parts into a movie though
What good parts?
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what else is weird?
No. I give up. i don't want to know what's weird.
See, in the Force Awakens, how long has passed since the fall of the galatic empire?
30 years.
So how old is Snoke?
He's a force sensitive alien. His age doesn't matter.
Who trained Snoke to use the dark side?
I don't know, one master, one aprentice is not a set rule among the siths. It's just tradition. It's possible Darth Sidious trained Snoke as well as Darth Vader
Then how come there aren't many Knights of Ren? Why would Snoke only train Kylo ren, when the First Order clearly is an elite group of
There are supposed to at least 6 others. Rey sees them in a force vision when she first touched Luke's light saber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the new Star War movies?
I  liked them but I think that they can be a lot better.
Yeah, I know I think the previous movies are way better.
Yes, I hate that there arent many jedais in the latests movies.
I think thats one of the biggest flaws as well.
So whats your favorite movie?
I loved the Phantom Menace, I thought it was pretty cool.
I liked that movie as well, I thought it was really good.
And your favorite movie?
Mine was Episode 3 I just loved watching how Lord Vader was created.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which star wars movie is your favorite?
I liked the one with Darth Maul in it.
Oh wow, that one is old.
Yea but it had the best fight scenes.
Yea it was pretty good, but the new one is better in my opinion.
You think so?
Definitely, Rey is the coolest character so far.
I'll admit, she is pretty awesome.
The next one is going to be even better.
We'll have to wait and see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen return of the jedi
Yes its great
Its a classic movie
I love carrie fisher and Harrison Ford together
They have great chemistry
And it makes the movie even better
Yes it really does
The director does a great job
They are great movies
With a great director
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the better mentor to Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi or Yoda?
Of course Yoda is the better mentor!
Why is Yoda the better mentor?
It's because Obi Wan Kenobi got killed by Darth Vader in the first movie.
Ah, that's true.
Right! Obi Wan Kenobi did not really teach Luke Skywalker anything before he died.
I think he told him about the force.
He did, but Yoda was the one who helped train Luke Skywalker.
It would of been better if he was trained by the both of them at the same time.
Yes! He would have better skills.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what did you think of Rogue One?
Weeel... I liked parts of it.  It had a lot of great action scenes and it was really neat to visit the Star Wars universe from the perspective of non-Force powered characters.
Yeah, I'm with you on that.  I thought Felicity Jones did a great job playing Jyn.  And I liked Donnie Yen's character.
He was the blind guy, right?
Yeah, that was him.  Dude is nearly fifty years old and still kicking butt in Hollywood movies!
Yeah, he was pretty cool.
One the less positive side though, I thought the CGI scenes with Tarkin and Princess Leia weren't quite there as far as completely realistic.  It fell squarely in the Uncanny Valley section of things.
Yeah, especially with Tarkin.  They had the guy look waaay more cadaverous than I remember him being in the first film.
Yeah, I know, I heard one critic even saying something like, "Was that CGI, or did they find some way to revive the actor's corpse?"
Oh, that's terrible!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is prettier, Padme or Leia?
I'd say Padme was prettier, but Leia had a better personality.
Leia definitely had some energy to her. She was the coolest.
It kind of weirds me out when I think about her kiss with Luke.
That was no big deal. She was just trying to get Han's attention.
He definitely got jealous.
Yeah, and Luke just gloated. That was funny.
I'm glad that Han and Leia got together.
Me too, but Ben didn't turn out too cool.
He must have had a dark side nanny or babysitter when he was a kid, or maybe just too much of his grandfather in him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Harrison Ford was awesome in Star Wars!
I know, I am so sad that he was killed in the newest one.
He must have made a ton of money from those movies, he could have stopped acting!
Did you know that in A New Hope he only made $10,000?
That is insane! Was he very famous at that point?
Not completely. But still, it wasn't very much money.
Well it definitely made him more famous so it was worth it!
He had so much chemistry with Carrie Fisher as princess Leia.
I always kind of thought that they didn't have any chemistry at all.  It was always fighting.
That was kind of the appeal though, they weren't perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder what it means by the last jedi
I think the jedi will try to unify themselves and not worry about light side and dark
In Rogue One there was the force user, should have been trained
There was no one to train him
It looks like Luke is in charge of them now
The Jedi don't get as much training as they used to
Maybe the Jedi and the Sith will join together to fight a common enemy
I feel like Luke will have a son or daughter, they have to continue the family theme
Who do you think the last jedi is, maybe Rey?
Maybe it just means Luke, since Rey and Finn aren't Jedi yet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi
Hey there
Do you like star wars
They sre my fsvorite movies
Mine too
Ive even played lego star wars on playstation
Is it fun
So much fun
You should get it
I will
XXXXXXXXXXX
When you watch the original trilogy now, what do you think of the antiquated special effects?
I would call them "classic" rather than "antiquated."
Why sugar-coat it? They're obsolete now, with CGI doing all the effects that anyone could imagine.
But look at the CGI in the second trilogy. It's soulless.
Some people would say it's beautiful, perfect.
That's part of why I like classic animation like matte paintings and stop-motion better. It's not perfect.
I don't get you. Isn't its perfection a distraction from the story?
No, it reminds me, even on a subliminal level, that human beings sweated blood and worked a zillion hours to make it happen.
I guess I see your point. More hands-on makes it meaningful to you.
Exactly. I admire the special effects teams who worked on the original trilogy, because of the hard hands-on work they did to make those films effective.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of the great things about Star Wars is that they manage so many fantastical aliens.
I know! Like Jaba the Hutt.
I'm really surprised that the special effects were good enough to create him.
Or yoda, for that matter.
Yeah! I mean, at least Chewbacca was a tall guy in a suit.
It's different when you can just put on a suit.
Were there any others that you found particularly impressive?
I always thought Bib Fortuna was cool looking.
Who was that again?
The alien who advises Jabba the Hutt!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Kylo Ren and the Knights of Ren are Siths, right?
No, no, no. They can't be.
Well, why not? They use the Dark Side, right?
Using the Dark Side doesn't make one a Sith. The Sith were wiped out, anyway.
So there couldn't be more?
Well, the Sith followed the Rule of Two, meaning that there could only be two Sith at one time.
Yeah, well, maybe Darth Vader had a secret apprentice or something, so there were actually more than two?
That's unlikely, and even if go ahead and say Snoke was Vader's apprentice even then he probably wasn't a fully trained Sith.
So, he wouldn't be considered a Sith, and so Kylo Ren wouldn't either, even Snoke had some Sith training?
Yeah, even being trained by a Sith Lord isn't enough to be considered one. It's a whole thing, really.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your least favorite part of the new Star Wars?
Probably the bad guys.
Yeah, Kylo Ren is pretty bad.
Just a little to whiny for my taste.
I know! He's like a teen ager on a tantrum.
I'm not sure I like the Emperor type guy either.
I'm not real keen on him either.
Too much CGI.
That's how I feel too.
I wonder what they'll do in the next one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We gotta talk favorite villains.
Well, mine was definitely Boba Fett.  I mean, despite his silly name.
I don't really get the hype behind that guy.. he had like.. what, three lines?
Dude, he had a FREAKING JET PACK!  As they say on the internet, you're argument is invalid!
Ahhh.. I think Darth Vader is cooler.  Boba can't block laser blasts with his fist.
Yeah, but he also has all that cool gadgetry. Wrist mounted rope for the win!
Ahhh.. he's alright.  Still going with Vader
All right?  He's got Wookie scalps for trophies!
Wookie scalps?  Where did you see that?
Well, they don't explicitly show it in the film, but they detail it on the toy and stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Darth Vader the ultimate villain?
I think James Earl Jones played him perfectly.
It was tough because you cannot see the emotion on his face.
Yes I agree with you on that one.
So do you think Darth Maul was better?
No he wasnt even around long enough to say that.
I think they were in the same amount of movies.
Not being able to see Vader's face was a different persona.
Yeah thats true.
Kylo Ren could be the next ultimate villain
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best planet in star wars for you
I like the snow one what was it called
Their is more than snow one
Well the most popular one
I think i know which one you mean
Yeah what was it called
It was called hoth i think
Yeah that was it it was in Video games too
I think it is pretty cool because ATs
They are designed excellently
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
Well, I watched a bunch of the older ones over and over again on VHS when I was a kid, so those tend to be the ones I'm most familiar with.
But you're not old enough you saw them come out in the theaters originally, are you?
Nope, but I think these tapes might even have been taped off of television!
So of the older ones, which one do you like the best?
Return of the Jedi.
Ah, the culmination. What do you like about that one in particular?
Well, first of all, the acting gets a lot better in this one than in the first two movies!
What do you mean?
Oh come on, the story is wonderful but the acting is so bad in the first film. Harrison Ford is by far the best, and he's not great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many films are there in the star wars series?
Well I guess there are the first three from the seventies and eighties then the prequel three in the two thousands and now they are making the newer series
Plus was there not also a cartoon?
I think there was but it wasn't very popular among adults but I think they took the cartoon story line and made that a part of the video game
Wow I remember playing the pod racer game on the nintendo back in the day but that was a part of the franchise for episode one
I would have to say that episode one is my least favorite. I just hate jar jar binks.
For sure that was the most useless racist character.
Plus the fact that he was completely computer generated so the actual on screen time looked so cheesey
I feel like that was something unnecessary for them to do, they could have had a more real feeling from the use of a real actor.
In all the movies I hated no character more than jar jar binks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best Star Wars movie?
It's the original Star Wars, from 1977.
The series never improved since then?
The series did fine, of course - but the original is a classic!
They're all classics, to be honest.
A New Hope is the most classic, though.
It does have many great sequences, like the Death Star trench run.
And it introduced us to all the great characters.
Still, though, The Empire Strikes Back told us so much more about them.
But it only built on what A New Hope started.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
Definitely the Empire Strikes Back.
Oh, why's that?
I loved the twists and turns. My favorite scene was when Han saw Vader and was about to shoot.
That's definitely a great moment. My favorite would have to be the original Star Wars though.
It's a classic; you can't go wrong.
The storyline is so well done. Plus, I loved "Ben" Kenobi. He's my favorite.
Ah, if I had to pick I would go for the Han/Chewbacca duo.
They have an amazing rapport, that's for sure. Poor Chewie, he never got his medal.
We can only hope someone gave it to him later!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the Force Awakens?
I think it is a shameless rip off of A New Hope.
I completely agree. Even down to Kylo Ren killing Hans Solo.
And blowing up the Death Star by doing a jump shot.
Hey, at least they made Rougue One to explain why there is a flaw
Yeah, that was a really good movie.
And since everyone dies, we won't have any sequels.
Or ill-concieved prequels.
The Revenge of the Sith was ok.
It was seriously the only one they needed to make.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best fighter in all of the Star Wars galaxy?
Yoda of course!
Would he beat Vader in a fight?
I'd love to see that! I dont know who would win
I think yoda would win, but after a long right
Why do you say that?
Vader is stronger but Yoda is more agile
True, Vader would be better at first but then get tired
Yeah that's why Yoda can only win in a long battle
I wish I could see a fight like that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate Star Wars.
Why? What's wrong with it.
I just don't think it's a good show. It's too childish.
Well, lots of kids grew up with Star Wars in the 80's and 90's.
Don't you think the plots are too basic?
Star Wars was one of the first shows to do good vs. evil. It's a classic
Classically bad.
Well don't discount other people's tastes. Don't go to the dark side.
The dark side. Really? Do I get to use the force in the dark side.
Not if I use the force on you first.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Star Wars?
Yes I have.
Who is your favorite character?
That has to be Darth Vader.
Why the villain?
I've always had a thing for villains and Vader  is one of those bad guys that's not such a bad guy deep down.
Why do you say he's not such a bad guy?
Well at the end he comes out of his big mean shell you could say.
Well that's true.
That  is why I like Vader.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are a lot of crappy deaths in Star Wars.
Totally, some unimaginably awful.
What's the one that bugs you the most?
EASY. Aayla Secura, my love, being distracted by a freakin' bird and then shot about 100 times in the back.
Yeah, that seemed overkill.
Yours?
Padma. Died of a broken heart. What a load of waffles.
That's possible, you know.
Yeah, but it was lamely done. Plus, the robots are awful doctors.
Yeah, didn't they have anesthetics? Couldn't Obi-Wan use the force to calm her?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about the star wars movies
Great i love them
Me too
I want to see rougue one
That came out last year?
Yes in 2016
I havent seen it yet either
Do you want to
Yes
I might get it soon
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
Princess Lea
Go figure!
Why!?
You're a girl!
SO!
So all girls pick the girl characters
And all guys pick Luke Skywalker!
...
See!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is you favorite Star Wars movie?
I liked the War of the Clons the most.
I thought that movie was interesting, I liked it as well.
Did you like the new Star Wars movie?
I didnt like them that much I think that a lot elements from previous movies are missing.
Yeah I miss the Jedi fights.
Exactly, theres no more jedi action any more, or too little jedi action.
Yeah and thats what made Star War movies special to me.
I hope that the movies that come out in the future improve.
Yeah I hope so too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was looking online at those top ten lists I love so much, and I saw one for Star Wars characters.
So who was the number one favorite? Yoda? Chewbacca? Luke Skywalker?
Nope, none of those. You know how movie-goers love a good villian.
It was Darth Vadar?
Yep, Darth was the number one favorite character.
So where did Yoda, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker land on the list?
Yoda was 5, Chewbacca was 7, and Luke Skywalker was 3.
None of them even made second? So who was second?
Second-Obi Wan Kenobi, fourth Han Solo, sixth R2D2, eighth Boba Fett, ninth Princess Leia, and tenth Darth Maul.
Wow, Princess Leia only ninth? I would have guessed that whole list differently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What language does R2D2 speak?
I don't know, some kind of binary jargon I guess.
How is it that every Star Wars character is multilingual?
They must have gone to really good schools.
And with C3PO, that dude speaks thousands of languages.
I know, how many languages are there in the Star Wars universe?
Beats me, but there are a lot.
I was disappointed when Ben took off the mask in the middle of The Force Awakens.
Me too, you're the bad guy, you're supposed to keep the mask on and keep the mystique going.
Yeah I know, it kind of ruined the whole movie for me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your least favorite Star Wars movie?
I would say Episode one.
Yes, it was a little too political.
It had it's good points though, the light saber battle was amazing.
It was, and to see the Jedi order and full working of the Galactic Senate was impressive.
Liam Neeson as Qui con Gin also brought a new image of the Jedi order.
Seeing a young Obi Wan was also fun.
But we can't let it slide, Jar Jar was a bit of a mistake.
And the age gap between Pademe and Anikan was a little odd.
But overall it was a good movie, I just with they would have kept Darth Maul.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Star Wars: Rogue One ?
Yes! It was really good!
It was way better than i expected it to be.
For sure. i like how it shows how everything started to fall once the Empire took control.
Yeah, cause in the originals they talk about how people died getting the plans to the Death Star but nothing else is said about them.
Right, this gave you so much more and bridged the gap on what happened and how the Rebels were able to start really fighting.
Did you see how detailed the CGI was?
Yes! it looked like it was really Grand Moff Tarkin really there and a young Leia.
Plus that last scene with Darth Vader, that made it worth it.
Oh yes! He was the Darth Vader we needed, not being sensitive Anakin Skywalker. He was Darth Vader, and showed why he was so feared across the galaxy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wanna come over
Sure we can
Well i want to write some stuff
Want my help?
Yeah
What are you writing
Well i want to watch star wars and make my own story of it
Sounds fun
It will be
I am on my way
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best Star Wars movie
I think it is Episode 1
why so
I love Episode 1 because it was the 1st star wars to come out in 20 years
that does not make it the best
well the information in it that sewed together the other 3 movies was brilliant
like how
learning about darth vander as a child
oh yea that was good
learning how Obie Won first started out
XXXXXXXXXXX
I could talk about Star Wars all day.
Bring it on - I'm ready!
Actually, I don't know that much about Star Wars.
What?  Have you at least seen the older trilogy?
Yes, but it was a long time ago.  Sometimes I forget everything.
Well, you should clear your weekend schedule and see them all.
What did you think about the new one, Rogue One.
It's more of an offshoot rather than following the original story.
I think it's time for some spin-offs.
I'll stick with Darth, Luke and Han Solo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Stars Wars movie?
I did! I can't believe they got everybody to come back for it.
It's amazing to see Harrison Ford a part of the franchise again.
I know, and Mark Hamill.
But what do you think they're going to know with Carrie Fisher gone?
I know, it's so tragic.
I don't think George Lucas would ever replace her.
I don't think so either. She was so integral to the series.
Maybe they'll have some sort of flashback sequences with lost footage.
That would be a nice way to pay tribute to her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you like Star Wars?
Well, I liked the movies okay, but I'm not like a die hard fan.  I mean, I don't buy the toys or memorize the lines or anything.
Well, hey, no one's perfect.
Haha.  Although I have to admit, some things were a bit confusing to me with the new one.
You mean Rogue One or The Force Awakens?
Uh.. the one with the girl and that one black guy and the rolling ball droid.
That was Force Awakens.  So, what confused you?
Well, I mean, why did that one bad guy had a cross guard on his lightsaber?  Seems like that be rather worthless.
Well, it's not explained in the film but actually, it's because the crystal he used to make his lightsaber was cracked and that caused a flaw in it's design.  Guessing he just kind of "made it work" rather than trying it again.
Ahhh... if you're too lazy to fix it, just cover it up.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There are some more things about Jabba the Hutt I remember.
Me too. I think that was the RETURN OF THE JEDI movie.
There was that creature standing next to him.
That creature had a head that wrapped around his neck.
And Jabba had a puppet creature on his tail.
It would laugh crazy like.
And Jabba had that dungeon.
They dropped Luke into it.
And Luke killed the big monster.
And the monster's keeper cried.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars Character?
Luke Skywalker of course.  He is the hero and the strongest.
I like Yoda because I thought he was the strongest.
Well, I guess at u til he died, he was.
I hope Luke is the strongest ever with the force in the next movie
Me to, I hope he just kicks butt.
I also like Chewbacca.
You can't forget Chewy!  He is the man.
What about Jar Jar Binks?
I know your kidding on that one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them?
I have to say that 'The Empire Strikes Back' holds a special place in my heart.
Really, why do you like that one so much?
I just really love the snow in the beginning, and I always love winter moments in movies.
Oh, that's kind of a silly reason.
I know, but it just makes me feel like I am there, or that I am really immersed in that world.
Okay, I can understand that justification.
I also like when Luke is in the swamps with Yoda.
Now that is a classic scene!
It's cool to see Yoda in his element, and to see Luke starting out as a Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How can you not have seen the start wars prequels? How is that even possible?
I'm not a fan of sci fi.
But, but these are not sci fi movies. They're an integral part of the Americana.
I'm every bit American as you, and I haven't seen it
That's what I'm asking. How is that possible?
Ok, Fine I'll bite. What ar they like?
What are they like? They're only the greatest movie trilogies ever made. We didn't even have the term prequel befoer this series
prequel is so stupid. It's a made up word. Even the prequels are, in fact, sequels.
Now that's just semantics, and neoligsm is a common thing in arts.
But stupid neologism is stupid.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that the new main three of the Star Wars sequel trilogy fits into the main three of the Star Wars original trilogies roles?
Yes and no.
Please explain!
Rey is obviously fitting into Luke Skywalker's roll, since she is going to be a jedi.
Yes, that's true!
I think Poe Dameron will fit into Han Solo's roll since they both pilot aircrafts.
What about Finn?
Well the only person left is Princess Leia's role.
They don't seem similar at all.
I know, but I think Finn is also going to use the force.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just thought of something funny that could have happened in Episode VII.
I was doing work, but okay. Let's hear it.
Know how Kylo says "Grandfather...I'll finish what you started."
Yes, when looking at the helmet, right?
Yup. Imagine if he was from a different region.
How would that matter?
"Dad-dad. Papa. Gramps. I'll finish what you started."
So?
Same meaning, but hilarious
I get it, but the tone would be too affected. It would be distracting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first see Star Wars?
When I was 10.  I saw it at the theatres with my parents.
What did you think of it?
I thought it was the greatest thing i had ever seen!
It was so different and innovative.
I had dreams about it for a week after.
What kind of dreams?
About flying a tie fighter and trying to kill darth vader.
But if you are flying a tie fighter you would be on the dark side right?
Yes but i turned rebel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Han Solo would be a fan of his solo movie?
I think he would think it was silly.
Why is that?
He was just sort of boring before the original trilogy.
Maybe it will show him and Jabba the Hut.
Maybe why he was in trouble with him.
What did you think when Vader put Solo in the Carbonite?
That was actual not originally part of the plot.
What do you mean?
They did that because Harrison Ford was not sure he wanted to do another movie, so they needed an easy out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen "Rouge One"?
I wanted to see it but I was so busy last December when it was released.
Oh, well it was a good movie.  You should see it.
I will.  I understand it is now available on pay per view.
I believe so.  Check with your cable provider.
I have heard that Darth Vader was a prominent character in the film.
Yes he was.
Makes since, based on the trailers.  Were there any other characters from "A New Hope"?
I don't want to give too much away.  Watch the movie for yourself.
I plan to.  Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was hotter, Leia or Padme Amidala?
Wasn't Padme Leia's mom?
Yes, but who was hotter.
I don't know, I guess Padme
I think Leia was hotter for her time.
Well Padme had better outfits.
Yeah, I'll give you that. Especially in Episode I
Oh yeah, that first outfit was insane
A lot of big hair
And a lot of white make-up
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could be in the Star Wars movies, what side would you be on?
I'd be on the Light Side of course!
Are you sure? The Dark Side has some cool vehicles and lightsabers!
None of that matters, we need to take down the Empire and bring justice to the galaxy
That sounds so cheesy. We need to have fun and obey the Empire!
I will never bow down to the dark side! Ever!
Why do you want to be on the Light Side?
I can fight side by side with Luke and Yoda!
I can take them down and prove I am a better fighter!
Pride like yours would be well accepted on the Dark Side!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about 'Rogue One?'
I absolutely loved it.  It was so much more serious in tone and plot than the other movies.
It was a refreshing new take on the whole franchise.  Are you excited about the other anthology movies?
What is coming up next in terms of Star Wars anthology?
Well, the next anthology standalone movie is the young Han Solo film.
I did not know that was happening!
Yup.  It is set to come out in 2018.
I don't think I can wait that long.  Who will be in the cast?
Well for starters, Donald Glover will play young Lando.  Also, the movie will star Emilia Clarke, Woody Harrelson, and Thandie Newton.
That is a star-studded cast.  I love all of those actors, so I'm really excited !
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know about how Star Wars is divided into Trilogies?
Yeah. Like A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, right?
Which trilogy series is your favorite, the original or the prequel?
Hmmmm.... I liked the Empire Strikes Back, but I also really liked Revenge of the Sith. I'll say the prequel series.
I liked Revenge of the Sith, too. I liked the idea of Obi Wan and Annakin Skywalker working together to rescue the Chancellor and their adventures.
For me, I liked the story behind the movie. Apparently, George Lucas reworked the entire story-line to change how Annakin fell to the dark side.
I heard a little about that. So, what happened?
Chancellor Palpatine convinced Annakin that the key to his rescue was in Annakin's turning to the dark side, which he did and then changed his name to Darth Vader.
That's part of the original plot though, no?
Ok, but what Lucas changed was having Count Dooku kidnapped along with Palpatine during the opening scene and then having Annakin murder Dooku as part of his turn towards the dark side.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Don't you feel something special about the Star Wars films?
I can think of a lot of special things about that series.
I know, but there's something in particular that I've been thinking of lately.
What's that?
I feel like each film gives a better look at a certain character than the other. Don't you.
I can see that for some, but not all of them.
I feel like it's there for all of them.
I see it in Revenge of the Sith for Vader, and in A New Hope for Luke, but not much else.
I definitely feel like it's there for more.
Maybe it is, and I'm the one who doesn't see it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think the Phantom Menace movie?
I thought it was really bad and really good at the same time?
How was it bad?
Jar Jar Binks is a joke of a character and the special effects seemed like they were really trying too hard to make everything use CGI.
That's a fair point, what did you like about them?
Darth Maul was awesome, and the new double sided lightsaber was really cool as well.
Yea I liked that too.
I hated that they killed Maul off though.
Yea he was one of the more interesting characters.
I hope in the future they bring back that race of characters.  I'd like to know more about them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Attack of the Clones yesterday.
Cool.  Was Liam Neeson in that one?
No, he was in The Phantom Menace.
Who played Anakin?
Hayden Christensen
Did Natalie reprise her role as Padme?
Yes.
Was Jar Jar Binks there?
A small role.
I heard he was computer generated.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite battle in Star Wars?
The Battle of Hoth, for sure, in Empire Strikes Back.
Mine was the battle on the forest moon of Endor from Return of the Jedi.
On Hoth, they had the snowspeeders and AT-ATs. It felt very tense and exciting.
The Battle of Endor was the conclusion to the trilogy. And it was very well-acted.
That battle was complicated, though. Hoth was very straightforward.
It wasn't that complicated. Alliance commandos were fighting stormtroopers.
On Hoth, stormtroopers were taking over the Alliance base on Hoth, while the Rebels evacuated.
The snowspeeder fight was interesting to watch, for sure.
My favorite part is using tow cables to destroy the AT-ATs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen tge original Star Ward trilogy?
Ueah but I think I only remember Star Wars.
It had the nar scene wuth all those creatures.
Yeah what was in the other two?
Empire Strikes Back had an ice world.
Oh yeah called Hoth.
Yeah that one eas my favorite.
What about Return pf the Jedi?
That was the one with the Ewoks in the forest.
Those Ewoks were cute.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched Star Wars?
The old ones, or the new ones?
The new ones.
No, I hate the new ones.
Oh, so you watched the old ones then?
Yes, I've seen all the old ones.
What's so great about the old ones?
Their characters were cooler.
Which characters?
Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, were all amazing characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
What was the last star wars movie you saw?
I saw rogue one not to long ago.
Cool, where did you see that?
I saw it in the theater with some friends.
I really liked it.
Yeah me too.
The ending was a bit sad.
Yeah I thought so too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know what else is weird?
No i don't know. And I don't want to know.
You know how in the end of Rogue One, they make a copy of the schematics?
Yes. What about it?
The screen was intentionally made to look like the screen from the 70s.
So what's wrong with that? it's good for the continuity of the films
Well, that's the whole point. Why is it necessary to have that continuity?
Because watching the original will be ruined if they had more advanced screens and technologies in Roguie One
ok Fine, even then why would they still use a little diskette to store the info? It's so anachronistic.
Again, continuity too the original films. These are important details that influence our enjoyment of the originals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best Star Wars villain? This includes people that are not siths
Peter Cushing's character in the original
You liked him?
He was very scary
I liked him too. He was the true leader of that movie
I agree
He has a very intense look
Yeah. He is scarier than Darth Sidious
I would not go that far.
The bottom line is he is a great villain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite weapon in star wars?
The lightsaber of course!
What color would your be if you had one?
I want a green one, like Yoda.
I wonder if that is allowed! I wish I had a red one
Are you from the dark side?
No, but I just like the color!
Well you better kill Darth Maul or someone on the Dark Side and take theirs then
I dont think I can do that, but I can hope!
If you can't get Maul's then try getting Vader's!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Return of the Jedi?
Yeah I liked it a lot. It was probably the weakest of the original trilogy but it was still good and a classic Star Wars movie.
Why do you say it's the weakest? What's wrong with it.
Well that's just in comparison to the other two. There's a lot of great thing about it but the weaker parts are probably the Ewoks and the retread of having another Death Star.
You didn't like the Ewoks? I thought they were really cute.
That's the problem, they're there just to have some cuddly cute creatures and sell toys and not to add anything to the plot. At least that's my opinion.
The battle scene near the end of Return of the Jedi was pretty great though, right?
Yeah that and the final lightsabre duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is amazing. That's why I will never say it's a bad movie.
Did you think that the final battle went on for too long? Some people say that it did.
I don't think so. At the time it was the end of the Star Wars  series so there should have been this massive epic fight to end a hugely popular series of movies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who shot first?
What do you mean?
Han Solo or Greedo?
Still confused?
Did you ever see A New Hope?
Star Wars?
Yeah.
Yes...
Remeber in the cantina?
Oh, yeah! Greedo for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe the Star Wars movies didn't follow a sequence but went backwards in time.
It is kind of weird and interesting at the same time.
I saw the last Star Wars movie and I wasn't disappointed.
Same here, is it possible that they may even gotten better?
This last Star Wars movie was much better than Revenge of the Sith.
Yeah it was.  It was also better than The Clone Wars.
What is your favorite Star Wars movie.
I'd have to say the first one, the one that surprised me so much and started it all.
Does it seem to you that Lucas seems more distant now in the production of Star Wars movies?
Not really, he's there.  He's not going to let anything happen to his crown jewel.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars movies?
Yes. What is your favorite one?
I think Rogue One was my favorite.
That one was good. I liked The Force Awakens.
I saw the first one in the movie theater when I was in the movie theater.
I did too. I'm pretty sure it was the first movie I ever went to at the theater.
I like the old ones and I like the new ones but I didn't really like the three in the middle.
Really? The ones with Annakin Skywalker?
I knew that he was inevitably going to become Darth Vader, and that bothered me.
Really? I thought it was interesting to see what his origins were.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you planning to see the new Stars Wars movie?
Very much so.  I've seen all the trailers.
Do you think they will have all the old characters?
I know it will have Luke Skywalker, Finn and Rey.
Who are they fighting?
I don't know.  There's not a lot of information about it.
The island where they shot some of the scenes are amazing.
Yes, I think they are in Ireland.
This should really boost their tourism.
Yes, they can call it Star Wars Tours.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Have you seen all the star wars films?
Yes I have.
Do you have a favorite part in one of them?
I love in Rogue One when they are getting the plans at the end.
That is a really action packed scene.
Yeah the actors do such a great job in that movie.
I agree.
Felicity Jones was incredible.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are all the novelizations they talk about?
They're novels based on the movies. George lucas commissioned them to be written.
And they're part of the whole Star Wars expanded universe?
Yes, for those who are not too familiar with them, it's kinda hard to follow because of the gaps in the stories.
Then there's the comics too
Yep, and tv series etc. They all contributed to the formation of the universe.
Then what's the Star Wars canon?
Like I said the Epxnded universe took 4 decades to evolve. And Lucas wanted to consolidate the whole thing.
So, that's why he rebranded most of them as Star Wars Legend in 2014?
yes. And he declared them mostly non-canon. So now the canon is the original trilogy, prequels, and the clone war animation series. All storiy lines must align with that canon set.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm really excited to see how they handle the Han Solo spin off.
Me too, he's a very beloved character, it might be tough to do it justice.
Agreed, Rogue One was handling a cast of unknowns so it was easy to win people over.
Yeah, we've already seen a young Han Solo in the original trilogy so it's going to be weird to see somebody that isn't Harrison Ford.
I have to imagine they know what they're doing though.
Oh definitely, the casting is pretty great, it'll just be weird since we already have that young frame of reference in mind.
For sure, I'm interested to see Donald Glover take up the Lando role.
He is mega talented so I know he's going to knock it out of the park.
Lots of Star Wars to look forward to this and next year.
I am glad to be along on the journey with you my friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you think luke skywalker will be in the new star wars movie?
I hope a lot. I love seeing the original characters back.
He was looking pretty rough and old.
I wonder how much that is the character choice and how much is due to mark hamil not aging well.
Probably a mix. But it makes sense for the character to look haggard.
I suppose it would make sense. Do you think the last jedi refers to rae or him being the last?
I have been pondering the same question. It really could be either of them.
I am looking forward to finding out. I also wonder what they will do about carrie fischer.
Ya her passing away was so sad. Too young for sure.
Yes too young, the world still needed princess lea but at least we had her at all. No other actress would have done it so well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
There's something odd about the Star Wars universe.
There's a trillion odd things. What bugs you now?
Lightsabers.
Yes, we know they're not possible and if they were real you'd melt your own body off.
No, not that--that's the science fantasy portion.
Then, when is it?
That they have to press a button to activate the lightsaber.
Why's that weird?
The technology should be able to recognize who is using it, and that shouldn't be necessary.
Maybe it gives them a better grip and more concentration.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the most memorable star wars movie for you?
I would say it is  the 1999 episode 1 because it was the first one I saw in theaters.
I see,that was an exciting time. I remember waiting in line for tickets. So much buzz.
There really was a ton of hype. What was your most memorable?
I have to go old school original Star Wars movie 1977. It was so meaningful to me  and watched it so many times,
It is the classic Star Wars. I liked how you had no idea of luke's father in the first one.
Ya it was so smart of george lucas to present them in the order he did.
Agreed, it would not have had the same impact if the plot in the  episode 1, 2 and 3 in the 200's had already been known.
Yes, the reveal of luke's father was such a shocker. Probably had a lot to do with the popularity of the originals.
Ya I still think they would have been groundbreaking but much less of a plot twist surprise ending if the movies had come out in order.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you looking forward to "The Last Jedi"?
Yes, it's going to be great!
Do you know the director?
Rian Johnson, right?
Yes! Did you know he used to work on Breaking Bad?
No way, really?
He did. He is famous for directing one of the highest rated episodes of the show, Ozymandias.
Neat! That means he's used to making things with a more dark and serious tone.
Definitely. I hope Last Jedi turns out like Empire Strikes Back; its my favorite.
Should be fun to see how it turns out. Can't wait until December!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any of the star wars movies?
Yeah I like some of them.
Which are your least favorites?
I actually do not like the older ones that much.
Really? Normally people say the opposite to be honest.
Well I really enjoy the first three.
Why is that?
Because they have better special effects.
Oh I see.
Well it was nice to talk to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey bro
Yo man
So what is good
Not much just reading some books
What sort of books
A book based on the star wars movies
What is the point of that
Well the books cover many things never mentioned in the book
That seems intersting
It is as if they are different stories
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you watch the Star Wars Rogue One movie?
Yes I did. Sad ending but the story was well very well written. Do you think they'll do another movie with the same characters?
I doubt it. I think they will want to continue the story from there. They've already given us the backstory for Jyn and Cassian.
Yes. I thought the story about how her father Galen Erso fought the Empire by working with them was really good.
It would be cool if they gave us more of a background for her parents though, like how they met and how he ended up fleeing the Empire in the first place. They didn't give us a lot of those details in Rogue one.
That's true. Also I'd like to see more about Saw Gerrera. I feel like his character was really interesting in Rogue One but they didn't elaborate much on him. I couldn't tell if he was a good guy or a bad guy, just that he helped raise Jyn Erso.
I also felt that the ending was expected but I kept hoping they'd find a way NOT to kill the two main characters off in the end.
Me too. I think the whole point of it was to have everyone root for them despite the knowledge of their impending death.
do you remember how in Star Wars when they talked about the how they obtained the blueprints for the death Star they said "many people died to obtain this information"?
Yes. That's pretty much what made me know they'd die in the end of Rogue One even though I kept hoping they wouldn't. Still it was a well told story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just rewatched all the old Star Wars movies this weekend.
It's been a while since I've seen those, what'd you think.
It's funny how obvious the new digital effects are.
You mean having a random Bantha in full digital randomly roaming outside the cantina on Tattooine wasn't normally there?
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.  Some of it was pretty cool though.
Like what?
The part with Han talking to Jaba before he take Luke and Obi Wan away from Tattooine.
Yea that part was really cool, but remember, Han shot first.
Yea, I hate that they changed the confrontation scene in the Cantina.   I hate that Lucas changed it to make it a self-defense thing.
Yea, Han was supposed to be a marauder type.  Making him not shoot first was a bad idea.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was Chewbacca an Ewok?
No, he was a Wookiee.
Oh, so then Ewok is what those little bears were called in 'Return of the Jedi,' right?
Yup.  I never understood by the way, how a bunch of Ewoks defeated the Imperial Stormtroopers.
Apparently it was mainly a ploy for merchandizing to children.
I suppose children would love Ewok toys since they're basically teddy bears.
Speaking of Ewoks, which do you think is the scariest creature in all of the Star Wars movies?
I think that the Sarlacc that killed Boba was the scariest.
That is a good one.  Though I think the Rancor is easily scarier.
Well it was definitely bigger, and it almost killed Luke!
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey what do you think about star wars boot up?
what do you mean by star wars boot up?
I mean they have sort of rebooted star wars series with new movies like rogue one.
I thought rogue one was individual solo star wars movie rather than series reboot.
Yes, it was suppose to be solo but then there is already new star wars movie in production
But I am sure that upcoming movie is not going to be sequel of rogue one.
are you sure about that?
yes I am pretty sure.
Oh okay I guess I trust you on that.
I am glad to hear that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When they re-released A New Hope, they edited the Greedo scene.
How so?
They made it look like Greedo shot first.
So Han did fire first.
Of course!
Cut throat pirate!
Smuggler. And what did you expect him to do.
Be a stand up guy!
And go face his lumps with Jaba?
I guess not....
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you like about Rogue One?
I liked that it was a different tone. Everything was really consequential.
Yeah, everyone died.
It was one of the few times Star Wars felt like an actual war.
You mean that scene on the mining planet?
Yeah. That ambush wouldn't have looked out of place in a World War II movie.
The end was reminicent of the D-Day landing.
In a way. It definitely felt like a do-or-die situation.
It had tension even though we knew how it was going to end.
And I thought it dovetailed into A New Hope nicely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if light sabers are real
What do you mean
Like from star wars
I am sure it does not actually exist
But what if someone tried
I do not know if it is possible
Have some faith
I am just being honest
Well you never know they might be able to be made
Well that is true i do not know
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in Star Wars?
oh, that would be Luke Skywalker.
Yeah, hes good, but who else do you like?
I think I really like the guy from the new movie. Do you know his name?
Are you talking about Kylo Ren?
Yeah!  That's him, I like him because hes kind of dark.
Yeah, I would agree with that.  What do you think is going to happen in the next movie?
I think he is going to become good.
Oh really?
Yeah, it seemed like he has that part inside of him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Episode 6 of the Star Wars saga?
Yes I did, I thought it had pretty cool scenes and its my favorite movie from the series.
Yeah it does have great visuals for the time and a nice story plot.
What part did you like the most.
I liked the final part, when Luke kills Darth Vader what about you?
When I found out that Darth Vader was Luke's father.
Looking back to the other movies its weird how Anakin became all darkside.
I know! and he could have had a different life with hes children.
I liked the costume and the voice of Darth Vader.
Yeah the voice creeped me out but I liked it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Would you call yourself a fan of Star Wars?
Yeah I would say so.
Cool.  Do you have a favorite character?
Yep, Darth Vader.
Oh the dark side nice.
What about you?
I like Han Solo.
He's the best mix of good and bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I like Return of the Jedi best.
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
My favorite character is Chewbacca.
How do you feel about the Star Wars prequels?
The prequels are my least favorite.  I don't think they are as bad as most people seem to.
How do you feel about the new Star Wars movies that have recently come out?
I think they have been good so far.
How do you feel about the original special effects compared to the newer, digital special effects?
I prefer a mix of both.  I sometimes feel that there is too much of a reliance on digital effects, in general, anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new star wars movie?
The force awakens?
Yeah.
No I did not. Did you?
Yes I did. It was great.
How was it to see carrie fisher and harrison ford back?
It was amazing! I loved seeing them back.
How were the new actors?
They were alright.
Yeah I figured.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do they ever show Darth Vader's face?
Yes
When?
At the end of Return of the Jedi
Cool. What does he look like?
He is old and bald
Interesting. Is it true that they replaced him?
Yes. The ghost scene in one of the new versions took him out and replaced him with another actor.
That is kind of mean.
I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish I had a light saber.
Like the one in the STAR WARS movies?
Yes. They could cut through anything.
They were like swords.
It was like they were in a duel at the end of the original movie.
They got in those duels in several if not all of the movies.
When they hit each other it sounded strange.
It sounded like electricity hitting each other.
It went right through Ben Kenobie.
That was a sad scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the prequel trilogy or the old trilogy?
I prefer the old trilogy it, they were my favorite movies to watch as a kid
I prefer the prequels myself but i do enjoy the old trilogy aswell
The prequels were alright but i thought they kinda focused on the wrong aspects of star wars and the tone wasnt the same
I know what you mean in some ways the prequels dont really feel like star wars but i still enjoy them, what do you like about the old trilogy
I watched it as a kid and thought it was so magical and i instantly fell in love with it, the sotry and characters are very well done
Whose your favorite character overall?
Out of everyone id have to say luke of course even though i know thats obvious. What about you?
I really like Obi wan in the prequels he is very well done in my opinion
Yes i quite like him in the prequels as well. One of the things they did right, i like Ewan Mcregor  for that role.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite character in star wars?
I am big fan of yoda in every movie he is in
Why yoda?
I just love his used of philosophy
Yeah he is very philosophical every time he is on screen
Yeah I think he is very cute too, so I like him
My favorite character is Luke skywalker
Yeah he is a good main character
I was surprised to learn who his father was
Yeah, it was a legendary scene
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think Snoke is?  Someone new or someone from the past?
I think he's someone new.  There are a lot of people he could be but I think they all have plot holes.
One person I hope he is not is Palpatine.  He was a great bad guy, and powerful, but he's gone.
I agree, if they did bring someone from the past maybe someone supremely powerful like Darth Plagous.
That seems to be the prevailing wisdom.  Or maybe the guy who trained Yoda whomever that may be.
Have not even given thought to that theory yet.  I have heard some theories about a return of Samuel L Jackson's character.
That was one I hear too.  But I wouldn't be big on that as a plot device.  Even though you never saw him actually die.
Yeah, and as we know in the Star Wars universe with Jedi, unless you see a body.
He isn't dead.
I just hope they don't do something lame.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think Rey's father is?
Definitely Palpatine.
Why is that?
Her fighting style, her aggressiveness, her Britishness.
I have a better theory.
You're demented, so this should be good.
She's Luke and Leia's daughter.
Wait...WHAT???
Well, they could have had sex during episodes IV-V, before Leia got with Han. Gotta do something for those long hyperspace flights. They didn't know yet either. Explains why she was dropped off: shamed the Jedi and the Senator.
You're a horrible person. But that's good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Star Wars is pretty awesome.
I know right! what's your favorite one?
I like Episode one.
Really? Why episode one of all things?
Jar Jar was so cool!
HAHAHA! You had me going for a second. For real though. What's your favorite?
I'm serious dude. Jar jar should have been Killed so many times, he was so annoying, but he lived through all that stuff
Yeah, I guess I see your point kind of.
What about you dude? What's your favorite?
The original. Yoda in the swamp can't go wrong.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Daniel Craig was in The Force Awakens?
I didn't see him.
That's 'cause he was a storm trooper.
Too cool.
You remember when Rey uses the Jedi Mind Trick?
And gets that trooper to release her?
Yup, that was him.
I never would have guessed.
That he was in it?
That he was a geek deep down!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the force?
It is an energy field that binds all living things together.
Cool.
Yeah. It was a really cool thing introduced in Star Wars
Who introduced it?
Ben Kenobi
Who plays him?
Alec Guiness
He is a great actor
I agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the Sand People from Star Wars?
Oh yeah, they were in the first one
Right at the desert planet of Tatooine
Yeah, they tried to steal Luke's speeder and the droids
But Obi Wan Kenobi scared them off
Remember they rode those big elephant looking things?
Those were called Bantas
Right, bantas. They were big creatures
And they had those crazy eye things
Yeah, they were kind of creepy looking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, who do you thing we'll see in The Last Jedi, what new or old faces?
Well, we may see the kids of Wedge Antillies, provided he had any?
Who knows, maybe will see Lando again?
I don't think so, Billy Dee Williams doesn't do much acting anymore.
True,true, so any other theories.
Well, Finn might return since he's in the trailer, and his injuries didn't seem irreparable.
Yeah, what about Luke, how do you think Mark will play him.
I think he'll be part Obi-wan, part Yoda, part an old hermit who doesn't want to get involved, but feels he has too.
Well, I loking forward to the The Last Jedi.
Same here.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think there is a chance for Kylo Ren to turn back to the light side like Darth Vader in his final moments?
I don't know. I mean I wish he did, but we all know what he did to Han Solo.
Yeah, that was brutal coming from his own son.
His facial expressions during the last fight with Rey were interesting.
It looked like he was questioning himself.
There's also the fact that his mentor is some powerful being.
Yeah, he sounds more powerful than the Sith Lord from the original trilogy.
I wonder if Rey or Luke Skywalker will be able to get through to Kylo Ren.
I would love to see that happen!
I can't wait for the next movie to come out, I want to know what happens!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of The Force Awakens?
I really liked it, but it was a little of a let down.
How so?  I loved it.
I was very similar in plot to A new Hope... The first one.
I understand where your coming from, but that didn't detract from my overall enjoyment.
I did make me anxious and excited to see the next one....
Me too; I think Rey is going to get some serious training from Luke.
I hope so.  That new soccer ball robot is so cute as well.
Gotta' love the advent of quality CGI that makes it possible; total eye candy.
For sure... Rey is cute too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
In all the Star Wars movies, who is your favorite character?
I would probably have to say either Han Solo or Obi Wan Kenobi.
Oh, Han Solo is one of my favorites too.
He's such a good character and Harrison Ford plays him so well, especially in the first trilogy.
Yea, he's good at playing kind of like the rascally, space pirate type of character.
Yea, him and Chewbacca are such an unlikely pair, but someone how it works so well.
He definitely brought a lot of comic relief to the movies.
Yea and his own individual storyline was really interesting too.
Yea, I heard they're making a separate movie that is just all about Han Solo.
Really?! That would be awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who played Obi-Wan Kenobi?
That was Alec Guiness.
British actors are so much better than American ones.
I agree. Alec really gave the first movie a grounded presence.
He is a good actor.
Did he send Luke to find Yoda?
Yes, I believe he did in the second movie.
Which one was that?
That was in The Empire Strikes Back.
That one was even better than the first movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you going to see the new star wars movie?
Probably not.
Why not?
I haven't seen the last one, so I would be lost.
Well go see the last one then, they are cool.
I don't like the new characters.
You would like them if you saw the movie, Luke Skywalker has a daughter.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Yea the new girl is his daughter, and Luke will probably start to play a really big role.
Oh, that is pretty cool. I'll go watch it then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How cool were the pod racers in The Phantom Menace?
They were definitely pretty cool, but really dangerous looking.
I think all of the vehicles in Star Wars look pretty dangerous.
Yeah but I wouldn't mind having an AT AT to drive around.
I loved them in the Hoth scenes, even though they fell apart.
That was one of my favorite scenes out of all of the Star Wars movies!
I loved the Ewoks in that movie too! They were so cute and cuddly.
Did you know that they rank as one of the most hated characters in the franchise?
No way!  They were super cute and helpful.
They were a little bit corny.  But they werent bad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens?
I liked it a lot, but I think the plot was so similar to A New Hope that it felt more like an homage than a new movie.
Yeah, I thought that too a little bit, but I liked how they added so much more diversity to the cast.
Yeah, that was great, but I hated seeing all the internet trolls complaining about reverse racism and reverse sexism.
Ugh, for sure. What is it about the internet that seems to bring out the worst in people?
I think the combination of the Star Wars Universe and the internet can be a bad combination sometimes.
How so?
So many people have loved these movies for so long that they have a hard time accepting changes to their favorite childhood impressions about them.
Like the huge controversy over whether Han shot first, right?
Exactly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the saddest part of Star Wars?
I thought it was really sad when Padme died
Yeah, she had a huge funeral though and that made me happy
She looked at peace and was pretty
Yeah it was a sad scene.
I really liked her character in the first few Episodes
Natalie Portman did so great. I could tell she loved Anakin
She never knew she gave birth to really important Jedi
That is pretty sad. She is in Heaven and is proud of Luke and Leah
She wasn't a bad fighter herself, she did what she needed and helped the Light Side
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see any of the star wars movies?
Yes I saw the sixth one.
That is it? That is strange.
Yeah but I liked it a lot though.
What was your favorite part.
I loved when darth vader had the mask taken off.
Oh that part was awesome.
It was sad though.
You should see the other ones!
I will make a point to!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How long have you been watching Star Wars?
I have been watching star wars since i was eight and i was born in 1970.
Are you all caught up on the movies?
I haven't seen all of them, but i have seen most.
Who is your favorite character?
I have many, but if i had to say i would say Yoda.
Do you go to the theatre to catch the movie there?
Sometimes, but usually i see it at home.
Will you go see the new one?
Yes. i look forward to seeing the new star wars movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know a lot about the Star Wars movies?
I know some things because I like watching the movies.
Okay, what was the name of the third movie which was released?
The third movie released was "Return of the Jedi" which is actually Episode VI.
What year was it released?
"Return of the Jedi" was released in 1983.
Who directed "Return of the Jedi"?
It was directed by Richard Marquand.
Did George Lucas have anything to do with the movie?
Yes, he was the executive producer and also a co-writer of the screen play which was based on a story that was written by George Lucas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite female character out of all of the Star Wars movies?
I kind of have a soft spot for Leia, she is just a classic.
She does have all of the iconic costumes and her tough girl attitude.
She has so many good one liners too during the movie.  Carrie Fisher was great in the role.
I do love the original cast, but I also love Gin Erso.  Plus her romance story was great.
The ending of Rogue One was so sad though, but I kind of loved how it led into the beginning of a New Hope.
That's true, I do love that they made a movie that wasn't about the Skywalker family and was about what was happening other places in the galaxy.
I loved all of the movies, but Rogue One was definitely something different.
I agree. Plus Diego Luna was pretty good looking too. I loved his character.
I'm so sad that both of them died in the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope?
It was amazing when it came out. I think audiences were looking for something different in the movie sector.
You're right. The characters and the story were so different than anything that had been done.
I know. Who would think that robots talking to each other would make a good part of the story!
Yeah, and what about Chewie's character? It's a good thing that Luke and everyone always translated for him.
It was different to cast Mark Hamill as the hero. He certainly didn't look the part of a glalactic warrior!
I know, but that made it more interesting. Luke's character was so anxious to get into the war with all his friends, though.
Casting Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor was a good move. He played the part of Obi Wan great!
And what about the light saber? That was an unusual weapon to have.
Yeah, and it was interesting that only certain people could use it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite droid?
Oh I know what mine is, but yours better not be Threepio.
It's not. It's the super sarcastic sassy droid in Rogue One.
Ha, he was funny, but raises a lot of ethical questions.
Yours?
R2D2. He's super functional and is sort of an deus-ex-machina.
So what's the ethical issue?
If you create a robot with personality, it's alive and conscious.
So?
That's artificial intelligence, and it's being used as slave labor, despite being self-aware.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which battle do you think is best in all the Star Wars movies?
It is a toss up between Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back and the second Death Star attack in Return of the Jedi.
Yeah, snow speeders in Empire were pretty cool.
I like the AT-AT walkers - the stop motion effects were awesome.
I think that the Imperial officers reactions to Vader made him seem that much more evil.
Also, the mystery surrounding the Emperor and his holograph appearance.
The line, "I am your father..." has to be the greatest Star Wars line ever.
In addition to "I love you...I know" - Empire has the best lines.
Very true - and they leave us in suspense as to what will happen next after Luke is rescued.
Right, at that point we didn't know what would happen to Han Solo.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is better an X-Wing, Y-Wing or the Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars movies?
How could you even ask this? Of course it's the Millennium Falcon.
Sorry, I was just curious. I also like the Millennium falcon.
It's okay! Yes, the Millennium Falcon is basically the main ship of the movies.
I'm surprised how big it is from the outside since they only really showed two areas.
Yeah I think the rest of ship is only for cargo stuff.
I wish we could of seen the rest of the ship.
That would of been awesome!
I hope there are more closeups of the cockpit in the future.
Yeah a view from the back would be good!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear they're going to some how keep Princess Leia in the next Star Wars film?
I did read some articles about it. I think it's going to be really fascinating especially after the passing of Carrie Fisher.
I know I was so saddened that day. I'm really interested to see how Lucasfilms will include her. Do you think she'll get a reunion with Kylo Ren?
I think if they somehow manage to use Princess Leia, there has to be some moment with her son Kylo Ren.
It's such a fascinating story line they're creating if you think about it.
I know, we still don't know about Rey, we're not sure if Kylo is going to turn, we have no clue where Finn's character is heading. Then there's Poe the ace pilot, he still needs more story.
There's so much to look forward to. I hope the next one we get more of a backstory on Poe too. The chemistry between him and Finn was great. I was sad when Han Solo died though.
That was tragic! He gave himself to his son and Kylo ended him.
Such a powerful moment, I felt such anger. I rooted for Rey when she took down Kylo Ren.
I know! We haven't even mentioned Luke's role yet!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the Empire in the Star Wars movies ever learns anything?
Not sure what you mean by that.    Please explain.
Well, they have built two Death Stars, and a third in The Force Awakens.
That was a Star Killer, not a Death Star.
Well, aren't the two weapons functionally similar?
Yes, I guess so, with the latter just being bigger.
So they build them, but there is always some minor flaw that can be found in the plans.
Exactly!    You would think they would have some better encryption.
Maybe not even that complicated.     Just add a virus into any set of digital plans.
That would be evil.      Automatically disable any droid's operating system!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Star Wars movie comes out this year.
Yeah I'm looking forward to that.
Me too. I hope Luke is in the movie more this time.
I think he will be. I just hope they don't kill him off like they did with Han.
That would suck. I don't want to see Luke get killed.
Same. I want to see how strong he is now. Hope he gets a have a lightsaber battle.
Oh I'm sure he will have at least one saber battle in the movie.
Maybe Luke and Rey will team up to fight Snoke.
I don't think we'll see Snoke fight until the 3rd movie.
Yeah you're probably right..
XXXXXXXXXXX
I read an obituary last August about Kenny Baker, who played R2D2 in the Star War movies and had passed away. He seemed like he had a good life.
He must have been really small to get into that R2D2 machine!
He was, he was about three foot eight inches tall. He was sick for a long time at the end, but his family said he had a long successful life.
How many Star Wars movies was he in?
Three of the regular Star Wars, and 3 of the prequels.
Everybody loved R2D2. He was so cute.
His family said he was well loved by people all over the world. He was also in other movies like Flash Gordon, The Elephant Man, and Time Bandits. He started out as a club performer and did summer shows and charity events. So he had a long storied career.
That's alway nice when people can look back and not have any regrets, because they got out there and lived, and did whatever they had to do to chase their dream.
His character as R2D2 will be entertaining people who watch Star Wars reruns for many many years.
I'm glad he had such a busy, good life.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite star wars movie?
The force awakens.
Do you think they will bring harrison ford back?
no.
Did Hans solos son die ?
I am not sure if he fell in the lava flow at the end of that movie.
How tall is chewbacca?
Hah..no idea
!  No idea
!  Seven feet tall?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Name me someone who became famous because of Star Wars.
Sure, I can do that. Ben Burtt.
I don't recognize the name. Was he in the supporting cast?
In a way. In fact, he won an Oscar for his work.
Come on, don't keep me in suspense!
Ben Burtt was the sound effects editor. He invented all the cool sounds that we all recognize from Star Wars.
Oh, like the buzz-swish of a light saber.
And the beeps and boops of Artoo Detoo.
And the heavy mechanized breathing of Darth Vader.
Ha! I can see now why you call him a supporting player. The movie would not be the same without his work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars movie?
I'd have to say "A New Hope". It's the first that was produced by George Lucas.
Why do you like it so much?
It's not for the acting, except for Sir Alec Guinness;  but for the whole romance of it.
Romance?! You mean between Luke and Leia?
No, no, I mean - look at it! It's set on desert planet orbiting two suns, there's atmosphere there!
What, like air?
No, I mean the kind of feeling you get when you watch "Lawrence of Arabia". Desert romance.
I didn't get that. Can you give me an example?
Of course. The best moment is the sunset on Tatooine, as Luke watches the twin suns go down the shadows deepen in the desert, the music swells, and you feel like you're right there on Tatooine with him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Rey will turn to the dark side in the next Star Wars movie?
I kind of think she might.  She has a lot of anger.
But she seems to have a lot of control over the force so far, even without training.
Maybe Luke will turn to the dark side this time?
I think maybe Luke wants to get rid of both the light and dark side.  He seems tired of it all.
I heard there is a new character called Rose that is going to be in the new movie.
I heard that too, but I am not sure what her role will be yet.
I also heard that the next movie is going to be a little darker.
I am a little anxious since the title is called The Last Jedi.
That is a very vague title, but it could mean a few things.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Return of the Jedi?
Yes
Did you know the title before it was called that?
No. What was it?
Revenge of the Jedi
Really?
Yes. They changed it a little bit before it was released.
That is a cool title.
I heard Han Solo was supposed to get killed in the third one too.
Wow. I wonder why they changed it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what gives with the twins kissing?
Huh?
Luke and Leia.
Oh, yeah. That was bizzar.
They kiss in the second, and then in the third Leia indicates that she's always known they were siblings.
Gross.
I think Lucas just came up with the siblings bit in the third movie.
Writing off the cuff?
Yeah, he's pretty infamous for that.
True.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the worst Star Wars character ever?
No question for me: Jar Jar Binks.
You win.  Just a horrible idea.
And offensive too.  They made him so annoying.
I believe many were upset that they made him try and sound Jamaican.
There was some backlash that he was culturally insensitive.
I didn't see that myself, it was everything else that was annoying to me.
Remember the way he spoke?
How can I forget?  Made me want to pull my hair out.
Just another bad idea from George Lucas when doing the prequels.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is more evil? Kylo Ren or Darth Vader?
Ooh, good question. There's so many places this can go.
I think Darth Vader.
Why is that?
He was a fully-trained Jedi, and CHOSE to do what he did. For decades.
Kylo Ren helped destroy an entire star system.
Yes, but he's young. He still has time to be redeemed sooner rather than later.
Kylo is more powerful for sure, though.
Why do you say that?
Darth couldn't sense his own daughter in the same room as him. That's kind of sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Such a shame Maul was wasted
How was he wasted
Well Darth maul got to star in the worst movie in the series
How would you say it is the worst
Come on now
I am serious
Episode one was a train wreck
Even Jar Jar is not  that bad
You have gotta be joking
Nope not one bit
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the Anikan sand quote?
It was cheesy
I think I knew what he was going for. But it was cringy
That might have been the idea
Anakin struggled with love
Yeah
It's not surprising that he would focus on the physical part of a woman he likes
Padme was also an important person
It made sense that they fell in love
Anyone would if they were in hiding like that
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the newest Star Wars cast?
I loved Natalie Portman in it, she was so awesome as Padme.
I agree! And what about Kiera Knightly? Those two together are just a dynamic duo.
What about Carrie Fisher as the classic Princess Leia?
She was amazing. It's such a shame what happened.
I know, but her spirit lives on in each and every Star Wars movie to come.
Absolutely. George Lucas knew what he was doing when he cast her in the original. It was an amazing choice.
Did you know that he had to get some inspiration from Akira Kurosawa?
Really?! I had no idea. That makes sense though. I can see how it gave it a more personable feel.
Absolutely! And with a ten million dollar budget, they had to make sure it was great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Star Wars?
I watch some of the movies, but I mostly play the games.
Oh, that's cool! What games?
Battlefront 2. Battlefront 1. All of the battlefronts basically
What happens in battlefront?
Well you play your favorite character, and you get put on a battleground and fight.
Awesome. I want to play that game. Who do you usually play as.
Darth Vader. He's a total tank and when he uses the force, it's game over.
I'm mostly a Star Wars movie guy. But the games seem fun.
Yeah we should play some time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the planet Hoth?
Is that the snow/ice planet?
Yes, the one from Empire Strikes Back
Yes, that was a pretty cool planet. A lot of strange creatures
Yeah, I liked all the different outfits everyone wore
Yeah, I liked the snow stormtroopers
Yeah, they were pretty cool
Darth Vader didn't require a snow outfit
That's because he's mostly machine
Good point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you excited for the new Star Wars movie? I think it's coming out around Christmas.
I am! I really excited to see Luke Skywalker train Rei.
I heard the movie is called "The Last Jedi". I wonder what that means.
Hmm. Maybe Rei will be the last Jedi because she will return balance to the force.
I was actually wondering if Kylo Ren will turn out to be the last Jedi.
I hadn't considered that. He seems like such a dark character, almost beyond redemption.
That's true, but so did Darth Vader. If Kylo Ren really wants to be like Vader, he will need to return to the light.
I really wonder if Kylo is related to Rei in some way.
It's possible. I actually think that Rei is related to Obi-Wan somehow.
That would make sense, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really enjoyed Rogue One.
I didn't care for it that much actually.
Why didn't you like it?
The whole thing seemed like an exercise in futility, as it is clear from the beginning that no one is going to live.
I didn't really expect that actually, and the fact that everyone dies made the movie very affecting to me.
If you didn't see it coming I could see that. The battle sequences themselves were pretty great.
They were very thrilling. This was a really solid sci-fi war movie.
I found the characters to be a little thinly developed though.
I liked them quite a bit, and was pretty depressed as they were killed off one by one.
We are going to have to agree to disagree on that part.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you think Rey is related to Luke Skywalker?
I doubt it. Wouldn't Luke remember her?
We only saw Luke for one scene. Maybe he did recognize her.
Who would her mother be? We never heard word of Luke marrying or anything like that.
In the books, he married Mara Jade.
That's not in the movie, though. I doubt they're related.
I guess so. Luke Skywalker isn't the only Jedi in the world.
I think Luke might have trained her, though.
Maybe she was hidden away when Kylo Ren massacred the Jedi trainees.
That would explain why she was abandoned on Jakku.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happened in Force awakens?
Didn't you watch the movie?
Yeah I did, but I fell asleep in the middle of it.
What! It was so good.
Yeah, I had a really rough night before.
Well, it's kind of fuzzy, but basically Rey ge's captured by Kylo ren, and escapes, then she learns she is a jedi, and wins the fight against Kylo ren.
That's pretty awesome. Were the fights cool?
Actually there weren't too many fights, but there a lot more in Rogue one.
I'll have to watch that movie.
Yeah, let's watch it together. I'll watch it again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Star Wars IV.
Wow, the first Star Wars.  Who was your favorite character?
Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia.
Mine was Harrison Ford as Han Solo.
I liked the Death Star storyline.
The Obi-Wan Jedi business was cool too.
I thought it was silly to use light sabers.
Yes, very hokey.
Darth Vader was mysterious and dark.
I liked how he got away, getting ready for the next movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whats your favorite star wars movies?
The clone wars
That was a good one
What about you?
My favorite is the return of the jedi
That was a good one too
They are all good really
Thats true
I hope theres more
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of the latest movie?
I thought it was pretty good. Definitely better than the previous three.
Can we at least agree that the one's with Mark Hammel were the best?
No doubt. The original three will always be my favorite trilogy.
What's your favorite scene from Star Wars?
The light saber fight between Darth Vadar and Obi One is classic.
It's the whole good versus evil thing going on.
Not only that but it was so new for it's time. The special effects at that time were breakthrough.
To me Star Wars just takes you to another place.
I agree. I've never found another movie that just lets me completely get lost in it for a few hours.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mark Hamill is looking pretty old in the most recent trailer.
He is old.  You have to remember the original came out 40 years ago.
Which is nuts if you think about it.  It still holds up well today.
I believe Mark is 65 now so it's expected he's going to show some age.
I'm very interested to see his character progression this movie.
Yeah.  It strikes me that this a older, wiser Luke.
Probably a Luke who is done with fighting overall and lacks some purpose.
I think he knows a purpose, but might be too disillusioned to chase it.
I'm predicting Luke dies in this next movie.
Don't say that, we already lost Han!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Vader or Yoda?
Vader, duh!
Leia or Rey?
Dang, that's a tough one... Rey, I guess.
Do you like ewoks or wookies more?
Hmm... Wookies.
Wookies?! Why not ewoks?
Because they look weird.
HA HA! Really?
Yeah, totally creepy looking.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the star waes franchise
Love it
I love the movies
Me too
The guy that came up with star wars is a genius
And rich
Yes that too
I cant get enough
Me either
Ive watched the movies alot
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the newest Star Wars movie?
Yeah, I saw The Force Awakens last weekend with my boyfriend.
What did you think of it?
I enjoyed it a lot, but I was a little confused about how it really connected with the other movies.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I liked Rey a lot though.
Oh, I loved Rey! I'm excited to see where her story goes. And Finn too, I really liked him.
I really enjoyed that they kept Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It made it more real.
Are you going to see the next one when it comes out?
Yeah, I thought I probably would, we should go together!
It's a date!
XXXXXXXXXXX
This is interesting
What is interesting
Well the Blue rays of the star wars movies
How is it interesting
Well they changed some things
Oh?
Yeah it is weird
How is it weird
Some of the effects dont make sense
Oh they changed those
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Star Wars movie The Force Awakens?
Yes, I am not a big Star Wars fan but I thought it was really good.
What was your favorite part?
I really liked the main character, Rey.
I agree, I thought she was a good example of a strong female lead.
I liked the addition of BB8 too.
Me too! And I was so happy that C3PO made an appearance.
What do you think is going to happen in the next movie?
I don't know - but I cannot wait to find out.
I hope we find out where Luke Skywalker is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like the middle three Star Wars films that I guess you would call the first three.
You mean episodes 1-3, the prequels?
Yeah man, little orphan Annie and all that.
The first one stunk, but Clone Wars and Revenge of the Sith were decent.
Yeah, those two were alright but just too much computer animation in all of them.
I agree, they didn't look anything like the original films.
I do though think Abrams did a good job getting back to the original look and feel of the brand with Awakens.
Me too, but he's not directing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson is.
Yeah I know, but I like that dude, he's done some cool films and I think it will end up looking like Empire.
Man I hope so, Empire is still my favorite out of all of them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what's your favorite Star Wars movie out of all of them?
Including the new ones, you mean? I think Empire Strikes back is the best, but I can't really pick a favorite
As strange as it sounds, I think I liked Revenge of the Sith the best
Really? Everyone says the prequel movies were really bad
They weren't perfect, but I think Episode III wrapped up that part of the story really well. And it led into the original trilogy, so you saw some of the same characters.
Oh yeah, did you see Joel Edgerton as Uncle Owen? Too bad that wasn't a bigger role because I like him as an actor
Maybe if they make an Obi-Wan movie they will have Joel Edgerton come back as Uncle Owen
That would be a great idea. I heard that one of the books had Darth Maul come back and attach Obi-Wan near Owen's home or something
That's awesome, but I also heard that the books don't really have anything to do with the movies.
Now that Disney owns Lucasfilm, they're more willing to take risks with the stories. Here's hoping they give this storyline a chance!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever watch any movies?
All the time.  I like to watch the Star Wars movies.
I do too! I own them all and watch them all the time.
I do too.  Have you seen the most recent one?
Yes, I saw it in the theater.
I went on opening day when it first came out.
Star wars is more than just movies.  It is fun to collect all the memorabilia too.
I have to agree.  I have shirts, actions figures, and posters too.
We will have to watch one the movies together sometime.
Sounds like a plan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, did you see the latest Star Wars movie
I know. It was sad. No Luke Skywalker or Han Solo or anything!
Um, well, yes, it's a prequel. Rogue One is actually about the events that led up to the very first Star Wars film.
Couldn't it have had Han Solo though? I mean, he existed in that time period, right?
Well, maybe, but I don't think it would have made sense. He wasn't doing anything related to the storyline at that time.
Even better! We could have seen him in his early days.
OK, but Harrison Ford is pretty old now. I mean, it probably would have been a younger actor to play young Han Solo
Nah man, CGI! We could have had a badass Han Solo.
What is your obsession with Han Solo?
Han Solo...
XXXXXXXXXXX
Besides The "I am your father" thing, was ther3e anything else you thought was a surprise in any of the movies?
I'm thinking of a couple of them from VI, but I can't remember how surprised I was the very first time.
You saw this in a theater, first run?
Yes. I was definitely surprised that Leia was the bounty hunter at the beginning.
That one got me too.
I'm lucky in a way.
How's that?
My memory is so bad, I'm still occasionally surprised.
Ha, ha! At your age, having seem it first run, I'm not surprised at that.
Surprised at what?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever watched the Star Wars movies?
Of course.  Who hasn't?
Which one is your favorite?
I'll admit that I liked the first batch that were made.  I think the stories were easier to follow?
I know.  I liked the characters.  I especially liked Han Solo.
Yes.  He was cool and crazy all at the same time.
I also thought Darth Vader was scarier.  The new ones seem to have too many bad guys that you don't focus just on the one.
Yes.  He was pretty creepy.  I thought he was particularly creepy when he took his mask off.
It wasn't at all what I expected when I saw that.
Those really were some great characters and story lines.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your opinion on the Star Wars movies?
Oh, well, overall I really enjoyed all the ones I've seen and would definitely rewatch them.
Which ones are those?
The first trilogy that came out plus The Force Awakens. There was something that bothered me in them though.
Oh?
Yeah, it seemed like every time a light saber was used it would affect the victim differently. One time it would cut right through somebody, then it would be propelling them back, then it would be making them simply disappear.
It's not the most realistic of movie series', I admit.
Oh I know, I just like consistency. Like, I don't care if something is wild and fantastical and doesn't make sense, as long as it doesn't make sense in a consistent way, know what I mean?
Yeah I feel you. I had my own issues with the inconsistencies myself.
You'll have to tell me about them sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, I didn't believe it at first, when Vader claimed to be Luke's father.
It does come a bit out of left field, doesn't it.
Exactly.  The first movie was written as if Darth and Annakin were separate characters. The revelation in Empire Strikes Back doesn't match what came before.
It does, however, match the Degobah cave scene.  It was foreshadowing.
It was weak foreshadowing, though.   Lucas really should have put in some more info about Darth and Anakin.
I think it's effective the way it is.
I don't.  I think that it's the kind of thing the audience will disbelieve.
You'd need to do a study.  All you'd need to do is find 500 people who don't know that Vader is Luke's father, and show them the movies.
I think that would be impossible.
Oh, I'm sure of it.   It's too well know. You could try, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like The Force Awakens?
I haven't seen it.
What! Why not you love star wars!!
I LOVED Star Wars. The original first three. The "prequals" sucked.
I don't know, I liked The Phantom Menace.
Of the three prequals The Phantom Menace was the best. The 2nd one was boring and the last one felt rushed.
Rushed how?
I felt like they were in a hurry to wrap up the whole Darth Vader is Luke and Leia's father and then goes to the dark side. Poor story, poor development.
I guess that makes sense, i hadn't thought of it that way.
Sorry to ruin it for you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you like the star wars movies
of course  i do
do you like the new ones or the old ones
to be honest, i like the newer
howcome?
better graphics and better fights
yeah, they were more intense
i grew up around the prequels.
so theres the nostalgia factor
indeed
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite part of the new Star Wars.
Probably Fin.
He is a really great charachter.
Yeah, I really like his back story.
I know! A Storm Trooper gone good.
Or bad...from the Empires perspective.
Too true.
Wait, not the Empire...
Yeah, what are they called?
I can't remeber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Star Wars character?
I like them all!
You have to have a favorite
Nah, I just root for the bad guys
That's terrible!
Why?
Because they want to kill everyone!
So?
You don't see how that's bad?
To each their own?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
That's a tough question, but I'd have to say Obi Wan.
Interesting choice.  Why?
He's an interesting character.  He's a strong Jedi, and he is a good mentor.
Do you think so?  Even though his protege went to the Dark Side?
Well, that was not Obi Wan's fault.  Who is you favorite character?
I love Princess Leia!
Nice!  She's really cool.
Yeah, she's really the hero of the whole story.  She's the one searching for Obi Wan in the original, she goes after Han Solo, and even now in the new movies, she is a rebel leader.
I never thought of that.  She's a strong character.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the new Star Wars Trailer for the Last Jedi?
I think it looks amazing!
Yes! I'm really hoping they finally reveal who Rey really is.
Well if you notice in the Force Awakens, when Rey finds the lightsaber, its the voices of the old and young Obi Wan Kenobi.
Maybe shes actually realted to Obi Wan and not Skywalker like everyone thinks.
Or it could be both.
I'm also curious as to whats going on with Kylo Ren.
Yeah, and what Supreme Leader Snoke is doing and who he actually is.
I'm just excited to see Mark Hamill-Luke Skywalker again!
Hopefully this time he gets to actually say something.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I heard this week that Hayden Christensen and his wife decided not to tell their child that he was Darth Vader.
Really, that's strange.  I would tell everyone that I was Vader.
Me too!  But apparently, they don't want their child to connect him to one of the most villainous characters of all time.
I guess I can agree with that.  But I would still want to say the occasional, "I am your father," in Vader's voice to my kid.
I agree.  That would be cool.
Hayden Christensen always seemed to reject his connection to Star Wars, so I'm not super surprised.
People didn't like the way he portrayed Anakin in Episode's 2 & 3, but I thought he was good.
I think he was good too. But his chemistry with Nataie Portman was non-existent.
That's true.  There was no chemistry, and it kind of took away from the films.
Natalie Portman had more chemistry with Ewan Macgregor.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that they guy who played C3PO has been the same in all of the Star Wars movies?
I read that he was he only actor in the franchise to be in all of the movies.
His voice is pretty unique so I couldn't imagine it without him.
C3P0 and R2D2 are some of my favorite characters.  They are like the Bert and Ernie of Star Wars.
I love that they are constantly bickering with eachother.
Did you know that they make a cameo in an Indiana Jones movie?
They are also in two Star Trek movies too!
I thought that Star Trek and Star Wars had a big rivalry.
I guess, but JJ Abrams directed both of them so I guess he gets to do that.
That is pretty cool, a neat little bit of trivia.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about Rogue One?
It was absolutely terrible.
Are you serious? I thought it was great.
Ugh, the plot line was so slow, I couldn't stand it.
Yea, but there were many plot holes filled from previous movies.
How so?
They explained why the Death Star had the one gleaming imperfection which caused it to explode.
That's true, but the movie itself was only good for the last 20 minutes or so.
I guess if you;re only in it for the action.
When there are Jedi's and the Force, of course I'm in it for the action!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Rey related to Luke or not?
Hard to say.  I'm guessing we'll find out in the next movie.
It almost seems like she shouldn't be at this point.
So there's so much speculation she is that it might be a buzzkill to actually learn she is.
Blame the internet for that.  People share thoughts too easily.
I personally think we'll find that she isn't.
You don't think so?
The galaxy is a massive place.  Maybe she just has the force.
Or maybe everyone has the force, they just don't know how to use it.
That's a great thought and would make for an interesting roundtable discussion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite Star Wars character?
It is definitely Yoda.
Yeah, he's great. Do you think they will do an origins movie that shows him when he was young?
They announced a Han Solo spinoff story already, but it would be great to see a young Yoda.
I wonder what he was like when he was younger and if he was always a Jedi.
Well in The Empire Strikes Back, he does mention that he's been training Jedi for 800 years.
Oh that's right. And he told Luke Skywalker that he was 900 years old in that movie.
We might not see an origins movie about Yoda, but maybe we will see him in the upcoming sequels.
True, he is a Force Ghost now.
Right, and you can bet that Luke Skywalker has been speaking him during his exile since after the fall of his new Jedi academy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Of all the Star Wars movies, which one did you like the most?
I think The first Star Wars movie remains my favorite. It introduced us to the space opera with wonderful characters that to this day remain relevant.
That's true. I mean Luke Skywalker is going to be in the Last Jedi movie and Kylo Ren is Han Solo's son which makes Han Solo relevant despite his death.
I wish they hadn't killed him off so quickly after introducing him in the Force Awakens.
I guess they wanted to continue the story with a new generation of Jedi.
Rey will make a great Jedi but they need to show more of her powers than they did in the Force awakens.
Maybe that's the whole point of bringing Luke Skywalker back for the Last Jedi movie.
I doubt he'll be as funny as Yoda was with him in the Empire Strikes Back.
No one is as funny or as wise as Yoda!
It'll be interesting to see how Luke and Rey's relationship unfolds in The Last Jedi.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Kylo Ren's lightsaber is so weird.
What do you mean?
He's got the lightsaber beams coming out of the side.
So?  Not sure what you're getting at.
I would think that those would be in the way and you could cut your own hand off.
Maybe they're there to help protect his own hand from getting cut off.
Guess it makes sense.  That did happen to Luke.
Exactly.  Maybe that's why it was built that way.
Never thought about that.  You're a genius!
You're right, I am a genius!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the first star wars?
Yes I love that movie because it was neat seeing little anakin.
Yeah I love when they show the innocent side of him.
Little did he know then that he would end up as Vader.
I know right?
It is funny how they have all these prequels now.
I wish it was in actual order.
But then again it makes it interesting the way they have done it.
I had a nice time talking to you.
Same!
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you enjoy Rogue One?
It was great! I can see why everyone recommended it.
A lot of people were worried that Jyn Erso was going to be a bad copy of Han Solo, but she wasn't, right?
No, and I liked how her values never quite aligned with anyone else's, even as she was fighting so hard for their cause.
I was so sad at the ending. I mean, it was perfect, but I loved those characters.
I would watch a movie just about Chirrut and Baze.
So would I! I wanted to know more about their temple.
I would sit and watch those two banter about anything.
It was kind of cool realizing that there were probably all sorts of force-sensitive people around going without training.
Maybe there were pseudo-Jedi enclaves springing up everywhere!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the newest Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens?
I was enjoying it up to the point where Han's own son murdered him. I was outta there after that.
Well, aren't they trying to do Darth Vader 2.0? He has to be really evil.
I don't care. There's very little reason for me to watch the rest of the series anymore, without Han.
C'mon, characgers die. There's still Luke, he looks pretty cool with that beard and stuff.
If Harrison wanted out of the franchise, there were SO many more satisfying ways to do it than to get offed by his son.
But this was the worst way, and that's probably why they did it.
Fine, you can have evil Han Jr. I'll go watch the original trilogy again and be much happier.
But...Leia. Carrie Fisher's last film. You have to see that.
I suppose I will, eventually, when it comes out on DVD. So I can scan to the Leia scenes and wish Carrie well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've always had trouble with the Star Wars timeline.
It's really not that complicated.
Well the release screws me up, I just want to watch straight through the story.
Ok it's easy, for the story line just watch 1-3,Rogue one, 4-6, Force awakens, and finish with the latest movie.
Whoa it's so simple...how could I have missed it?
When in doubt, go with release date.
I just like being able to binge watch without having to keep notes about which side I'm on.
You're putting too much thought into it.
Says the guy that has four different copies of each movie for each order to watch them in.
Don't blame me that my hardest decision about which one to watch next is, "how late can I be to work tomorrow?"
XXXXXXXXXXX
What does Star Wars even mean?
Well, there's lots of stars, and it's kind of a war.
I guess that makes sense.
Yeah and it's a pretty cool name think about it.
STAR WARS. You're right. It sounds cool
And it's nice and symmetrical. A perfect name for something epic.
Yeah, I like how symbolic Star Wars is.
Yeah I feel like Star Wars just focuses on being symbolic. Like their characters.
And their font.  Their opening sequence is just trying to be edgy.
That's an interesting way to think about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like the latest Star Wars movie?
I didn't see the latest one.
Did you see the one before it?
Do you mean the Force Awakens?
Yes, that one.
Oh, yes, I saw that one.
Did you like it?
It was really cool.
I liked all the action.
Me too, it was exciting to see all the characters they created.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So judging by your shirt, you must be a big Star Wars fan!
Actually I'm not.  My father gave me this shirt for Christmas and I wear it around the house.
Oh I see.  Have you seen any of the movies though?
Yes of course.  I've probably seen more of them than not.
Don't you also have a Star Wars key chain?
Yes I do.  It's a Star Wars Episode 1 key chain that my parents got me way back when Episode 1 came out.
Wow!  It lasted that long, eh?
Yes it did.  I never used it because I though it looked too good, so I put off actually using it for many years.
So, did you see Rogue One last year?
Yes, it was a very good movie and I look forward to seeing The Last Jedi when it finally comes out.  It's sad that Carrie Fisher passed on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which movie did you like better, "The Force Awakens" or "The Last Jedi"
Oh, they were both good, but I think that "The Last Jedi" is really my favorite.
Oh, why is that?
Because it really explains the back story well, but does it in broad strokes
What do you mean by broad strokes?
Well, for example, if you take the two not-so-good Star Wars flicks, you know, the prequels with Jar-Jar Binks
Oh yes, those were awful!
Well, one of the reasons they were awful (besides some horrible dialogue and insipid acting) was that they felt the need to explain everything to you.
Don't you want to know what actually happens?
Yes, but not down to the tiniest detail.  I want to be able to use my imagination to fill in some stuff.  Those movies didn't let you.  "The Last Jedi", along with good actors (nobody's cousin got a job on this one) had a great story line.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you feel about Rogue One?
Honestly I did not like it
Oh really? Why?
It wasn't as compelling as the other parts of the series
in what way?
i guess in the setting in general
What wasn't good about it?
Honestly it just felt like it took place on earth, it didn't put me in the same imaginary place as the other parts
i can see how it can be like that
thats why i dont like Rogue One
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Harrison Ford got paid just over 10K for the original Star Wars?
No way. Well, he wasn't really that well known back then
Nope. Star wars helped his career greatly. But still only a 100 a week was what he was paid
That's still good money even today's standards. That's like 4 thousand bucks a month. Well over middle class income.
yeah, and adjusted for inflation, it's over $39K today.
So wait, adjusted for inflation, he was paid close to $16K a month? That's a lot.
yep. And the last movie, the force awakens goes over $1 billion, Ford will make over 34 million from that
Sometimes I wonder if actors are paid way too much
How come?
No one deserves to get paid 34 million for being in a movie that's 2 hours long, at least if you ask me. Meanwhile school teachers barely make their bills. It's not fair.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the force awakens
Thats my favorite one
Mine too
What do you like about it?
I like Rey
Me too
Daisy ridley did a great job
She did and shes so pretty
Yes she is
Great actress
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie from the franchise?
That would be the Force Awakens.
Why that one?
I love the two new main characters Rey and Kylo.
I enjoyed that one too.
Did you like those two characters?
I did but I think at least right now with what we have to go on they're lacking a bit.
How so?
Well the old characters Luke, Vader they had so much lore and story behind them after it was all said and done it's hard not to put them way ahead as of now.
Yeah maybe with the future movies we will get more in touch with these new characters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
If you could be any star wars character who would you be?
Oh good question.  Let me think.
Sure.
I would have to say obi wan.
Ah good choice.
What about you.
I think I would want to be Darth Vader.
Oh the dark side interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Christopher Lee was the best Sith, hands down.
Oh, I agree.  I wish he had more screen time.
Too bad they can't CGI him into the new movies.
I'm sure they can, but really, it's not a good idea to try.  He was an amazing actor, no point in watering him down, you know. CGI couldn't cut it
Perhaps when hwe discover a way to resurrect the dead, we can have a Dooku prequel movie.
I'd love to see a Dooku prequel movie.
He's such a facinating character. A Jedi and a nobleman, who was seduced by Palpatine. And an elegant fighter.
The switch from beating Obi-Wan and Anakin at the same time to being curbstomped by Anakin was a bit jarring.
It was to show how much Anakin had grown in power and skill.
Still, the fight could have been a bit longer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Episode VII plays out like a kids cartoon
hm?
The way the events unfold and play out
How
It lacks the  nuance of the older trilogy
What trilogy
The one before it
I think that was not that way at all
Yes it was
I think it is nostalgia to you
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was R2D2 really an important character?
Thats a gray question in my opinion.
So what is your quick answer?
I dont think hes crucial to the story but it was a good side piece.
I think they could have done without the robot.
I liked it for the most part.
I just think its somewhat contrived now.
I think its science fiction so you have to take liberties.
Yeah but a robot without emotion seems silly
No thats not true, hes an integral part
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so did you see the latest Star Wars movie? The Force Awakens, I mean.
Yeah, of course. Like three times. Why?
Well, you remember that woman darth vader type? She led the stormtroopers.
Oh, you mean, Captain Phasma?
Yeah. That's her.
So what about her?
Well, I mean, I know she was the bad guy, but did you feel kind of bad for her? I mean, maybe it's sexist, but since she was a she, I don't know, I didn't want her to get hurt.
I mean, she was kind of a killer though, right?
I know. And she's wearing armor too. Is it weird that I felt sympathy for her?
Hmm, maybe. I mean, maybe you just have a thing for bad girls.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Big Star Wars fan?
I don't know about big, but I do like the franchise sure.
Do you have a favorite film?
I enjoyed The Empire Strikes back the most I think.
That is a great one.  A lot of people pick that as the best.
It is a classic.  What about you?
I like The first Star Wars.
A new hope, yes.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think about the Rebel Alliance?
They were more than just a group of guerilla fighters
Rogue One showed how organized they had become even though there was still a senate
The number of ships they had and the size of them shows how much support they had
It would be interesting to know how they got their funding
You assume the Empire was funded by taxes. But the rebel's government support was questionable
Alderaan must have supported the rebels.
The base on Hoth and on Yavin seemed to be far from civilization
It is likely the Death Stars cost more than all of the other ships the Empire had put together
The rebels made better decisions with their money
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which Star Wars movie was your favorite?
The very first one.
Really. So old.
Yes, but I think they get too carried away making them.
That's true.
Who's your favorite character?
That's a hard question.
Mine is Darth Vader.
Yeah. I guess mine too.
C3PO is annoying.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think Han Solo is very cool
Yeah. He is really funny too
They do comedy so well in the original
I agree
I like Han and Chewy
They are a great team
Did you like the cantina scene?
I loved it
Wasn't that werewolf cool?
Yes. I can't believe he was replaced with a lizard guy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Do you know much about Star Wars?
I know a little.
Did you see most of the movies?
I think I might have seen them all.
Oh cool.  Do you have one that you really like?
I really liked The first one from the first series.
A new hope?
Yeah that's it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In a fight between all of the Jedi and Sith, who do you think would win?
Like, Sith or Jedi, or an individual person?
Individual person.
Hmm. Well. Maybe Yoda? I don't think we ever really saw him lose a fight.
See, my money's on the Emperor.
The Emperor? Really?
Yeah. He only lost because of a surprise attack.
But only Vader was capable of making an attack like that.
You may have something there.
I still think it's Yoda all the way.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the last jedi in the next Star Wars movie?
I think it is Rey.
Why do you think the last jedi will be Rey?
Because at the end of The Force Awakens, Rey hands the light saber to Luke.
That makes sense. So in The Last Jedi, do you think Luke will train Rey as a jedi?
Yes, I think so.
Do you think Luke is Rey's father?
I am thinking so, but I haven't read ahead in all of the books by George Lucas.
I think The Last Jedi is coming out in theaters in December 2017.
Yes, and I am so excited!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your most favorite Star Wars side character?
My most favorite Star Wars side character is definitely C-3PO.
Why is C-3PO your favorite character?
I find C-3PO to be a great comic relief character.
What makes C-3PO a great comic relief character?
It is C-3PO's interactions with everyone that makes me laugh.
What is your favorite C-3PO scene?
There was a scene in The Force Awakens where C-3PO is trying to wake up R2-D2.
Oh, I remember that scene!
Yeah, his sarcastic comments are hilarious!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I loved the new Star Wars movie!
Me too! I cant wait for the next one.
Too bad Han Solo wont be in it.
Yeah but they are making a spin off of young Han Solo!
Will chewy be in it also?
Yes of course! it will tell the story of how they met.
That's awesome! what about Darth Vader?
I'm sure he will be its around the time he was in power.
Seeing Darth Vader in action again will be amazing!
Yes! i love Star Wars!
XXXXXXXXXXX
In your opinion, what is one thing you would change about the Star Wars series?
I would remove all the love scenes. The scenes with Annakin trying to flirt are so cringy and terrible. It was cool when Han Solo did it, but Annakin was terrible.
Haha, That's hilarious. I was thinking about making better visuals for the empire strikes back, but you made a really good point.
Yeah, its ridiculous how stupid the love scenes are with annakin, its no surprise that actor is not in any other movies.
I agree. So what would you say the best battle scene is?
Either the fight on planet hoth or the fight in the big arena with jedi and droids.
Wow those are two really good choices. I'd have to pick the one between jedi and droids because there was better graphic editing.
Yeah, once they developed more movies they started having way better visuals than in the past.
There's something nostalgic feeling about watching the old fight scenes though.
Definitely, I love all the old movies as much as the new ones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know, I've never been into Star Wars.
You're kidding.
No. It's just... I've tried, but they feel so pandering. They pick and choose and appropriate so many things, then blend them together and pretend they're new.
Well. I mean. They're not high art, but they're not really trying to be. You got to admit that Empire is kind of ambitious, at least.
I guess, for what it is. I thought the turn to an out-and-out serial format was kind of cynical. Hey, we're onto a successful franchise! Let's just assume you're going to tune in next time!
But, it was successful. I mean, it's a pretty good gamble to take that people will want to see the next movie. Even if it was Jedi.
That's just it, though. It's cynical. It's a gamble. It's a product contrived to suit a perceived consumer market. I guess most film has been, but this is really gratuitous about it. Though... uh. Jedi was clearly the best one, anyway.
What.
Seriously, it's the only one I kind of enjoyed. Most of that is down to the Ewoks.
What is wrong with you?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any Star Wars memorabilia?
I got the "Art of" books of the first trilogy, because they had the screenplays as well as wonderful artwork.
I wasn't into action figures, but I like movie posters, so I got the posters.
Have you ever been to movie poster sites? The original posters are worth a mint now, if kept in pristine condition.
I do have a few rare ones, as it happens.They aren't quite in pristine condition, but they're worth a nice little amount.
I have several other books, and there was a collection of pre-viz sketches done by Ralph McQuarrie that were fantastic, so I got that.
I guess there are geeks out there with basement shelves full of action figures still in their original packaging, so they'll be worth more.
Yeah, I was never that kind of collector. I didn't collect to sell later.
I agree. Somehow it takes the fun out of being a fan when you can't play with the action figures.
Or hang up the posters, right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, would you prefer a blaster or a saber?
I'm a Hon Solo kind of a guy.
A blaster then?
Of course. I'll bet you're more of a Luke kinda fellow.
Guilty as charged!
What's so great about the saber>
"It's an elegant weapon, meant for a more civilized time."
Settle down Obi-Wan
Ha! Blasters are so boring.
But you can't beat the range!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the latest Star Wars?
Yeah I thought it wasnt that great.
Why do you say that?
I think the acting was lacking.
You might be the only one to say that.
Maybe, but its the truth.
Did you want more of the original cast?
No I think they all showed up right.
How about James Earl Jones?
Now that would have been comedy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the greatest weapon in the Star Wars movies?
The Force!
No, I mean a physical weapon.
Oh, in that case it is Chewbacca's bowcaster.
How is that the greatest weapon?
It's just cool. I mean it's a laser crossbow. How can anything compete with that?
Laser Swords? Perhaps?
Oh, yeah, I guess the lightsaber is really the coolest.
It's my favorite, but you can pick the bowcaster if you want.
Nope, I am switching to Light Saber.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Han Solo's "I know" line was improvised?
Yes, I did read about that.
That makes the scene so much cooler.
It's impressive how an improvised line ended up being one of the best lines of the franchise.
It only served to elevate an already incredible and emotional scene.
When I first saw Han get frozen in carbonite, I couldn't believe that was how the movie was going to end.
I felt the same, though it added to the payoff in the next movie when Leia finally rescued him.
If you recall, she even repeated the "I know" line back to Han.
That was a great callback.
One of the many reasons why I love the original series so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard about the problems with the new Han Solo movie?
What kind of problems?
Both directors are gone.
What happened?
I heard they had creative differences with other people.
Do they know who the new director will be?
It looks like Ron Howard.
Ron Howard has directed a lot of movies.
I'll be curious how it turns out.
Me, too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you be interested in a spinoff series about Yodas life?
Oh my god yes, that would be the most amazing thing ever.
I feel like it would be a lot better than the new star wars movies they keep making.
Yeah, I don't like the new actors they keep getting. It would be nice to see more of Yoda.
I can only imagine how much of his life we don't know about, considering he is the oldest jedi in the series.
I really want to know where he came from, because there doesn't seem to be any other things in the movie that are the same species as him.
Well, he is a really unique character that's for sure. Most other jedi are human or similar to a human.
Yeah, I think its awesome how hes just a lil tiny guy, but he can still fight like a beast in Attack of the Clones.
If they keep making more and more star wars movies, I'm sure they will make some about Yoda.
If they didn't, it would be a bad mistake. People love Yoda.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's your favorite Star Wars movie?
I'd personally pick A New Hope.
The film that started it all. Can't blame you for that one.
I appreciate that. So what's yours?
I'd have to go with Return of the Jedi.
A classic. I'd say that the first three films are the three best.
Same here. The newer ones aren't too bad, either.
I really enjoyed The Force Awakens. It felt like a breath of fresh air to me.
I felt the same way, but somehow I enjoyed Rogue One just a bit more.
That's all well and good. It was a great film too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many languages did C3-PO speak.
"I am fluent in over 6 million languages."
Did he speak dork?
Huh?
That's what you seem to be fluent in!
Jerk! I just love Star Wars!
I know. Just yankin' you crank.
I'd appreciated if you didn't.
Oooh. Sensetive.
I do a Jedi Mind Trick on you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
My mom's favorite character is Jar Jar binks.
...no it's not!
It is. I wouldn't lie about something like this. Guess who her second favorite character is?
I don't dare guess...
Han Solo!
What?
Yeah, her second choice is better than her first!
I'm going to have a talk with your mom.
Please, your favorite is Boba Fett. You're not much better.
Yes. Yes I am.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder if we'll ever get 3D releases of the other Star Wars movies.
There are 3D releases for some of them?
Only Episode I. Supposedly they had episodes II finished, and possibly III but they never released them.
Just as well, I'm more interested in 4K releases anyway.
Not that it matters in the case of Episode II.
Why not?
Well, the movie was filmed in 1080p, so a 4K release would only be upscaling it.
The older ones are fine though, because they were made on film, right?
Yeah, but some of the CGI on the Special Editions was probably made at a lower resolution before being put back on film.
I guess I don't care that much as long as it looks nice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Empire Strikes Back?
No, it was too dark.
Whet? It was the best Star Wars movie ever.
I like the first one better. It was brighter and happier.
I can't believe this. You didn't think it was cool when Luke fought Vader lost his hand and found out Vader was his father?
Um, no.
You're hopeless. What's so great about the first Star Wars?
Remember the the scene where the ship flies overhead and keeps going and going...
Yes.
That was really cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the STORM TROOPERS.
I think they are in all the STAR WARS movies.
I think they get upgrades.
They look more modern in the newer movies.
But they still look mean.
They would get into all those blaster fights.
They were kind of like soldiers.
They would just going in and blast away.
But they had their Tie Fighters also.
And blast in space!
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you seen the new star wars movie yet?
Yes, and I absolutely loved it. how about you?
i loved the cast of characters.
jyn was a very good character
i agree, but its sad that she was separated from her father.
yes, and her mother too.
saw garrera really brought back memories too
I never realized how much I missed watching all the old characters
yes, me too. the old characters i loved
especially luke and leia
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Attack of the Clones again.
Did you like that one?
It wasn't too bad.  Loved Padma Amidala.
Yea, Natalie Portman rocks.
I wasn't too thrilled with Jar Jar Binks.
Yes, i think he was over the top.
I liked the battle, though.
Me too.  What else did you like?
I like the marriage at the end of the movie.
It was silly having robots as witnesses.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite scene out of any Star Wars movie?
It would have to be the fight between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker at the end of Revenge of the Sith.
Mine I would have to say is where Luke Skywalker finds out Darth Vader is his father.
That's classic. The shock everyone must have felt who watched it when it first came out.
Oh yeah that's one of the best twists in history.
I agree. It was pretty awkward that Luke and Princess Leia kissed before they found out they were brother and sister.
Yeah that was a pretty rough pill for them to swallow I would imagine.
Han Solo is my favorite character. He cracks me up.
Yes I love Harrison Ford in everything he does, but that's my favorite role of his.
Also Chewy is so lovable, and I love how close his and Han Solo's relationship is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
We should totally go see the new star wars movie together.
The Last Jedi? I am so down.
Yeah, it's supposed to be out on December 15th.
We should go to the premiere.
Like the night it opens?
Yes, we'll probably have to wait in line a few hours but the premieres are always the coolest!
I'm down I guess. Do you dress up?
We can if you want to!
I think it would be fun. Want to go as Hans and Chewy?
I'm so down. I call Chewy!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Darth Vader was really evil?
Yes. Look at all of the horrible things he did.
True. He did do some horrible things. But in the end, he turned good.
One good deed does not make up for a years of bad things.
Yes, but if he was evil, could have really done something so noble?
By that thinking, no evil person can do anything good.
Why would they?
Self-preservation.
Fine. But when he saved Luke, he wasn't protecting himself. He was more endangering himself. If he had had failed, the Emperor would have killed him.
Darth Vader was evil. Period!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of Rogue One?
I gotta say, I've only gotten partway through it.
Is it boring for you? There's so much going on!
But I'm not engaged. The girl is cute and spunky, of course, but this is not my Star Wars, I'm not emotionally involved.
Is there any character you like?
The little rolling robot cutie is the most engaging character to me. There, I said it, the robot is the best character.
That doesn't say much for anyone else.
Well, someone was smart enough to put Donnie Yen in the cast. He is absolutely amazing.
Yes, he was awesome in the Ip Man movies.
So I'll see the rest of the movie just to see him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They should bring back Mace Windu.
He's dead, though.  You can't get deader than falling out a window like that.
Luke fell out of Cloud City.  And yet, he lived.
Luke had Leia to pick him up.
First he used the Force to guide himself into a chute that opened at an improbable moment.  Mace is better than that. He could have one of those flying cars.
That is more plausible than Darth Maul's survival, and hurts the story less.
They'll probably bring him back for Episode 9.
I think they'd use  him in Rebels, instead,
Rebels can't afford Samuel L. Jackson.
They can't afford a lot of people. It hasn't really stopped them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all the Star Wars movies?
I think the question is how many times I have seen each Star Wars movie.
OK then, I guess you are a fan. I gather you loved them all.
I have enjoyed them all and sincerely loved some. The Force Awakens was amazing.
I agree. It was my favorite, hands down.
I was sorry to see Han Solo killed off, and by his son no less.
I know, that was brutal. I was not expecting that at all.
I was in shock. I avoid spoilers and gossip so I had no idea.
I think avoiding spoilers makes those moments all the more powerful.
I agree. That moment was a heartbreaker for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Wasn't Cloud City the coolest?
Yeah, Lando really found a cool job as a city manager there.
Yeah, and he had that one bald assistant that had those head phones.
Oh yeah I remember him. Whatever happened to him?
I don't think they showed anything in movie.
I imagine he was shot be a stormtrooper at some point.
Nah, those stormtroopers could never hit anyone with their blasters.
Ha! That's true.
Maybe it was Bobba Fett.
Yeah, he seemed to have better aim and intelligence.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite comedic moment in Star Wars?
Kylo Ren throwing temper tantrums was pretty sweet.
Yeah, I loved the storm troopers walking away. And the general reporting him had the "crap, we have to fix that, again" like it's common.
You?
Finn and Han.
Which scene.
The whole audience cracked up. See if you can finish it.
Okay...
"I'm going to use the force!"
"... THAT'S NOT HOW THE FORCE WORKS!" hahahah I loved it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
That wowld've been cool
You know he's giving into the dark side, and his saber is reacting to his negative energy
That would've been a nice touch.
See? It has a lot of those missed opportunities in the movie.
But still even with those little things, they're still all awesome movies.
Not the original. They should remake the originals with moden CGI
NO. That will kill the movies
No, it will be an awesome improvement. They're all digitized now.
Wait, huh. you're right.
Of course I am. Adding CGI to already digitalized movies can't be that hard.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like adam driver as kylo ren?
Yes.I think he is very talented. I also liked daisy ridley a lot.
Ya the rae character needed someone like her not too sexual more badass female.
I am interested to see her develop now that she has meet up with luke.
Me too. I think she is desitined to be super powerful as hinted at.
I  am sure it will take some convincing on her part to be trained by luke.
Maybe or maybe he knows she was destined to play a certain part and convinces her.
Either way the star wars movies are getting really good again.
Ya, some of them were not as good ... episode 2 for instance.
Agreed, but now they are back to really captivating story and acting as well. Too bad george isn't more involved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the Force Awakens yet?
Yeah, I saw it when it came out.
What did you think.
It was kind of over-rated to be honest.
Really? Everyone I've talked to liked it.
It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be.
Oh, I see. I was thinking of renting it from redbox this weekend.
It's not as good as the first three but definitely worth renting.
Cool I guess I'll check it out.
If you don't expect to much from it you'll enjoy it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The soundtrack in The Force Awakens was kind of weak.
John Williams composed it, just like he did in A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.
But the soundtrack was so prominent in those films. In The Force Awakens, it kind of disappeared.
I guess so. I can't really remember any tracks as memorable as the Imperial March or the Star Wars theme.
The effects in The Force Awakens was top-notch, though.
I agree. They really invested in practical effects, and it shows.
That was J J Abrams' work. He really likes practical effects.
It shows. In The Phantom Menace for instance, they did it all in CGI.
The green screening really hurt the prequel trilogy.
In those movies, the CGI looks badly dated now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Return of the Jedi?
Well, it's better than the prequels, that's for sure.
It's not as good as the other original trilogy movies?
That's right. It's not quite there.
Why? Is it something about originality?
Mostly that's it. It's far more recycled than the others.
The death star narrative repeating itself?
That's part of it. The end game between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was also predictable.
You thought Vader being redeemed was predictable?
Yes, it was hinted at. But Luke defeating Vader and killing the Emperor was obvious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars movies?
Yes!  I like all the Star Wars movies,
Did you know Star Wars II came out in 1977.
Wow! that is a long time ago, and they still going strong.
I like the episode" Revenge of Sith".
Yeah, that is a good episode, that is when Anakin Skywalker turns to Darth Vader.
I like the First "Star Wars" with Harrison Ford.
Yeah! that was great, I like R2D2.
In Star Wars II Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight.
There was also princess Leia in Star Wars II.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why did you like about the new Stars Wars Rouge One:  A Star Wars Story movie?
What I liked most is it filled the plot holes and it also answered a lot of questions.
Really, ok give me an example, please.
One example is, it explain why the Death Star was so easily taking down.
Who was your favorite charchter  and why?
Grand Moff Tarkin, because we now understand the charchter that was in command of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars movie.
Were you satified with the movie's conclustion?
yes, I was very satisfied, because it lead perfectly in to the first Star Wars movie.
What's the next Star Wars movie to come out and when?
The next movie is The Last Jedi and it comes out in December of 2017.
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey have you seen any star wars movies lately?
yes, i loved them, im watching the older ones right now.
the ones with luke and leia?
yea, and han sollo and chewbacca
i love chewbacca, he acts sarcastic all the time.
i know right? so does r2d2.
yep, poor c3po, always trying to keep up with everyone.
he almost always gets himself into trouble.
especially when he was scrapped, and chewbacca tried to put him back together.
that was hilarious.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Something bugs me about Star Wars.
Yes, me too, but what is it?
So, they are traveling in hyperspace, sometimes for LONG periods of time.
Yes, and?
And they have to eat.
Yes, and?
Some of them are in super tiny planes by themselves.
Get to the point.
How do they use the bathroom? They don't have space suits like astronauts do.
That's disgusting but a good point. They probably have a tiny airplane-sized room and have to be super careful. Or, they disintegrate it using the force.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What did you think of The Phantom Menace?
As a movie?  Pretty average, but the weak point of the franchise.
I know what you mean too much politics.
At least we got Darth Maul though.
Yeah, plus a young Obi Wan was pretty cool
And Liam Neison brought depth to the Jedi Order.
The age difference between Anikan and Padme was a little creepy though.
Yeah it was, and the part about him making C3PO.
I know, it didn't fit with the original movies very well.
No, not really.  But again, at least we got Darth Maul.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So which one do you think is the worst?
It's gotta be Phantom Menace.  Everyone agrees on that!
I don't know - isn't Attack of the Clones worse?
But The Phantom Menace has Anakin as a kid.
I know, he wasn't very good...
Remember all the times he said "Yippee!"?
I paid more attention to that annoying Jar Jar.
I don't think the kid could act at all.  And Jar Jar?  The worst.
Well, yeah, and he was in all three of the prequels, so they all kind of stink.
The Phantom Menace has the most Jar Jar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the new Star Wars hold up to the older ones.
I mean, you can not remake the feel of a New Hope.
But, their world has a new feel now.
Right, but still they are not as good.
How do you think they hold up to the prequels?
I would put the Force Awakens on par with episode two.
I think it has a similar feel.
Yes, the hand to hand combat.
I liked that the storm troopers got more of a back story in both.
I loved Finn's story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So which did you like better the old Star Wars or new ones?
Oh the old ones by far.
Yeah, the prequels just didn't have the same feel.
I can see how some people look at the special effects.  But the writing was awesome in the originals.
However did you see Rogue One?
Yeah, that had the feel of the original movies.
Also crazy special effects.
I know right?  The planet shots of the Death Star were un-real.
I'm hoping that the next movie has that feel to it too.
Oh yeah, on the new ones lets not let Jar Jar off the hook either.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello.
Hi there.
Are you interested in Star Wars?
Yeah I sure am.
What do you like about it?
I am a big sci fan.  I also really like the books a lot.
Star Wars books?
Yeah there are hundreds of them.
I didn't know that.
They are a great read.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Star Wars technology is so weird.
Why do you say that?
I mean, like, they have faster-than-light travel, yet all their graphics displays are frame wire, straight out of the '70s type stuff.
That's because Star Wars, the first one, back before it was called A New Hope was made in the '70s.
I know that, but if you look in the later films, even in like Revenge of the Sith or The Force Awakens they keep that look.
I guess that is weird, in a way.
Another strange thing is that they have real, working cloning technology, but instead of growing new limbs anytime someone loses one, they just give them a robot one instead.
Maybe robotic limbs are cheaper to make than growing real tissue?
No, the real reason is because it's not a very serious sci-fi franchise. Doesn't mean it's not weird.
It's more of a space fantasy, yeah.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hon Solo is like Lord Vader.
What are you talking about?
Well think about it, they both dress mostly with black clothing.
Along with half the cast, so what?
Ok, well they both did illegal things for power.
Hon Solo followed a code of honor at least, Vader is just evil.
Fine, last and most important. They were both killed by their sons.
Holy cow, you may actually be on to something.
If Kylo Ren ends up having a sister, then say hello to Lord Solo.
This is starting to get weird, I think we need a marathon to research this issue.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can think of at least four changes made to the Star Wars movies from 1977.
Name one.
The 2011 blu ray release had different lettering and a title in the lead in.
Very good. Another one?
The aunt tells Luke to tell your uncle in 2011, just uncle in 1977.
Wow.  What else?
Obi-wan scares off the Sand people with a higher pitched voice in 2011.
Anything else?
The Mos Eisley characters changed in 2011!
Amazing.  You're an expert!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what did you think of  Rogue One?
I don't know, I didn't really like the beginning at all.
Yeah, I agree, the first half hour of the movie was really slow.
Yeah, and it seemed like there were four different beginnings all just bolted together.
Well, the special effects were cool.
Sure, everything in the movie looked really great, I just thought the plot wasn't that great.
Well, they had to wrap everything up because it was a prequel but none of the characters are in any of the original movies.
Sure, but why not just have the characters ride off into the sunset instead of killing everybody?
I don't know, I guess they wanted to make sure nobody would be expecting sequels.
I guess. I'm excited for the next side story movie, though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite STAR WARS character is R2-D2.
His top would spin all around.
And he had a few blinking lights.
And he had the thing that could connect to the DEATH STAR.
He could tell the DEATH STAR computer what to do.
He made funny sounds that sounded like what he was saying.
He had like 3 legs. But I never saw him go up stairs.
Maybe that's why they always had ramps.
He could also do those hologram messages.
Without him they would never have gotten that message.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Han sure liked Chewy's crossbow.
I know. That was pretty funny.
I can see where you might get a taste.
I like the cross fire.
It's probably the best "blaster."
I don't think Chewy would have given it up.
Even to his Captain?
Maybe.
Han can get another one.
From the afterlife?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really think that they under utilize Princess Leia in all of the Star Wars movies.
What do you mean?
Well if she's the only other living relative of Darth Vadar and can wield the Force like Luke and Vadar, shouldn't she be getting Jedi training?
She is in command of things back at the base of operations.
Exactly, they are leaving her back at home while they go fight the battles.  It seems to me like she should be more involved.
But she comes up with all of the battle plans and lays everything out.
Actually you never see her do that.  Once they start an actual battle plan she is left out of it, other characters go through the plans of attack.
She brings all the people to the table, people wouldn't even be there to fight if not for her.
I still think they should give her a bigger role, she should be moving things with her mind and flying a ship.  In all of the attack scenes like when they are destroying the Death Stars in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi it's the weird lobster guy who gives all the orders.
I think you are underestimating her influence.  I think you see it much more in Force Awakens where she is running the base for the Resistance.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What part of Star Wars made you sad?
I got sad when Ben died.
That was sad.
I did not think Vader would kill him.
I also got sad in the third one when that big monster died.
Yes and that one guy was really hurt by it.
I got sad when the thing Luke was riding in The Empire Strikes Back died.
Me too.
There are plenty of sad moments in those films.
Yes. Even an adventure movie like that has sad parts.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch star wars?
Yes they are my favorite movies
Mine too
I have a replica lightsaber
Oh thats so cool
I love it
Ive always wanted one
You should get it
Ill have to look for one
Great
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see The Force Awakens?
I think so, was that the one about the Death Star?
Well, no that was Rogue One, this one occurred after Return of Jedi
Okay, but I thought there was a Death Star in this one too
No, there was a planet like the Death Star that blew things up
But isn't that what the Death Star is?
No, the Death Star is a space station not a planet
But I thought it was as big as a planet
No, more like the size of a small moon
I'm so confused
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the fact that female characters in Star Wars are written as strong characters and they do amazing things!
I agree! Star Wars is a franchise that has a lot of influence and it carries a positive message.
In what way do you think the message is positive, overall?
There are so many types of life that are depicted from A New Hope all the way through to Rogue One.
I agree. I haven't thought of it that way before, but you are right. The characters are so diverse.
You have Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee Williams. And the diversity and the talent is unlimited!
Lando Calrissian was one of my absolute favorite characters.
One of the most intriguing parts of the Empire Strikes Back is when it appears that Lando Calrissian was betraying the trust of Leia and Luke.
And then, it turned out that Lando Calrissian became a faithful supporter of the rebellion.
I love that part in The
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Star Wars?
I liked the original three, how about you?
Yeah I liked the first three as well and the new ones
The new ones meaning the prequels?
No, the ones that came out within the past couple of years
I thought there was just one
No there was another one
Really? I must've missed one
Yeah, there was one called Rogue One
I totally missed that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you watch The Force Awakens?
not yet.
It was good but had some flaws.
like what?
Rey is too good at everything.
well it is a movie.
yeah, but she automatically knows how to fly ships and fight.
maybe she learns.
It was kind of lazy screen writing.
i guess so.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was shocked last year when Carrie Fisher said she had an affair with Harrison Ford.
She did?  I never heard that.
Yes, supposedly while they were filming, they were having an affair.
Wow.  Well, they definitely had chemistry.  The sparks were almost visible.
Exactly.  And , it's Harrison Ford.  He's a hunk.
Poor Carrie Fisher.  I heard she was supposed to have a large part in the upcoming film.
Yeah, and her death was tragic - unexpected.  I wonder what they'll do now.
Who knows.  Maybe CGI?
The Star Wars franchise loves CGI, so that makes sense/
They definitely can't replace her.  Fans wouldn't support a new Leia.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The best movie was Empire Strikes back for sure.
Agree, it brought so much depth to the franchise.
Don't forget the epic cliffhanger at the end.
And the reveal of Vader being Luke's father.
Yoda was epic as well, brought understanding to the Jedi order.
Yoda was maybe the best part.  His wisdom is parallel.
It amazes me that even today those special effects are still relevant.
And don't forget how the movie has held up for generations.
Yes, my daughter and I have seen them and she loves them.
Good taste taught to your daughter you have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What happens at the end of Episode 4?
Luke blows up the Death Star
How does he do it?
He uses the force and shoots somwething into the reactor.
Cool. Does he get any help?
Han Solo comes in and saves him at the last minute.
That is cool. I thought Han was a bad guy.
He kinda was. But, at the end he changed a lot.
What was his friend's name?
Chewbacca.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What first got you into watching Star Wars?
I just randomly saw a part of one of the original movies and I thought it was really cool.  I ended up renting the original trilogy and I was hooked!
That is great!  The original trilogy totally made me a Star Wars lover!  Do you have a favorite?
I do!!  Return of the Jedi is my favorite!!  I love how Luke comes in and stands up to the emperor and also when Darth Vader throws him over the balcony and kills him.
I totally agree!  Plus the Ewoks were adorable! lol
Yes they were!!  What do you think about the new trilogy that they started?
I like it but of course nothing can beat the original trilogy!  Til this day, those are the best movies ever made!
Yes they are!!  I did really like Rogue one though!!  It fit in very well with the others.
I agree!!  That last scene with Princess Leia saying "Hope"...OMG! I just about wanted to scream!!
Me too!!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Luke's landspeeder in the first Star Wars?
Yeah, that thing was cool
He seemed like he had a lot of pride and joy in it.
Yeah, until he had to sell it to pay for passage on the Millennium Falcon
Oh right, he was upset that he couldn't get more money for it since the new model came out.
Right, but Ben told him not to worry about it.
I wonder what ever happened to that money. Do you think Han kept it
Absolutely. He was all about the money.
That's sad though. Weren't they friends in the end.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can't cash someone's check
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait for the new Star Wars movie to come out.
Me neither, I'm so excited.
Did you like the Force Awakens?
Yes, it was one of my favorite movies!
It was so much better than the last three!
I know, who was your favorite character?
Fin was my favorite.
Oh he was the best!
Who was your favorite character?
I still love Hans Solo!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's the best Star Wars movie?
My favorite has always been Return of the Jedi-- I loved Boba Fett and the Ewoks.
My favorite is the Emprire Strikes Back, though the new Force Awakens was really good too.
Yeah, it was a lot more relatable, I thought.  A lot more contemporary.
What do you think about the prequels?
I think I'm with the general consensus that they were largely terrible.
Yeah, though I did love Watto.
And, who can forget Darth Maul?
Yeah, I'd love to see more with him.
I wonder if they'll ever put him in another movie?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi.
Looking forward to more star wars movies?
Yeah sure am.
Any one in particular?
I'm looking forward to the Han Solo remake.
Oh yeah, I heard a little about that.
I think it will be pretty interesting.
Yeah I agree.
It will be very cool to see a Han back story.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Jar Jar Binks - yes or no?
Ummm, is that even a question? No way
Why not?
He was a horrible character, there's no doubt about it
Yeah, I don't know what they were thinking with him
Someone thought it was a good idea at some point
Whatever happened to him in the series?
I think he made a few more appearances in the later movies, but that was it
Hard core fans hated him
Yes, they did...for sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Was battle.
Definitely Jaba's ship.
In the Return of the Jedi.
Yup.
That was pretty epic.
I love how Luke does that flip.
And they R2 shoots his saber to him.
And he catches it in mid-air.
That might be my favorite too!
Join the club!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch star wars?
Yes i loved the movies
Me too
The force awakens is my favoite
That one was good
What was your favorite
I loved the clone wars
That was my second favorite
That one was pretty good
Yes i enjoyed it
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite color Lightsaber?
I like the purple one Mace Windu had.
Yeah, that's a good one - I kind of liked County Dooku's curved handle.
Darth Vader's red is always classic too.
I wonder who came up with the idea for Darth Maul's double bladed lightsaber?
Yeah, that was pretty epic when he ignited it during the final Phantom Menace dual.
I wonder if Kylo will fix his red lightsaber and get rid of the crossguards?
I don't know - I think it is a nice effect and made things seem more evil in The Force Awakens.
Do you think Snoke will have or use a lightsaber?
Maybe - his should be an epic gold/yellow color.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite part of Rogue One?
I loved the very ending when Darth Vader turned on his lightsaber.
Yes! When the room was dark and then all of a sudden a red lightsaber slowly appears.
That was the Darth Vader that we deserve!
That scene was perfect. You could hear his breathing while the scene was dark, and you just knew that something bad was going to happen.
And the music accompanied that scene so well.
I wonder if we will ever see another Darth Vader scene.
If we do, it will not be for a long time.
Maybe they will have a flashback scene in the next Star Wars movie that's coming out this year.
That would be one of so many reasons to be excited for Star Wars XIII!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen Episode VII yet?
I did. I thought it was pretty good.
My only complaint is how derivative it is of Episode IV.
It was at that. But all I asked was that it be better than the prequels.
Yes, my expectations were set very low as well.
I like the new generation of the cast, though.
How did you feel about Han Solo's death?
I understood why it happened, but there will be a real hole in the sequels without Harrison's charisma.
I didn't like that we only saw Luke Skywalker for a few seconds, but I suppose you don't want to cram too much into the movie.
Yes, overall I'd say the movie was the first solid Star Wars movie since Episode VI.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I didn't think that Rogue One was a great movie.
I didn't either. The story didn't really go anywhere.
I thought that the young actors did a fine job though.
I agree. Felicity Jones is a great up and coming actress.
Bringing back Princess Leia and Han Solo didn't help the story.
Yes, their relationship was too sentimental.
Han's relationship with his son was really idealized.
Yeah, the director took that relationship too far.
It really felt like a Disney film rather than a Lucasfilm.
Lucas would have done it much better as a director.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you watch star wars?
Yes i loved the force awakens
Me too
It comes on starz this weekend
I know what im doing theis weekend
Me too
Im so glad i have the starz package now
Its finally paying off
Im really exited
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was just reminiscing about when I saw "The Empire Strikes Back". You know, I felt pretty helpless after watching that movie.
I didn't see it when it was in the theaters, I was too young. Didn't it come out in 1980?
Yeah, I was in ninth grade back then. I saw it because I loved "Star Wars: A New Hope" so much.
I think I saw it on TV. So what made you feel so helpless?
Well for one thing, Mark Hamill's character, Luke Skywalker wasn't the focus of the film, he was only half of it.
And what else? I mean, didn't he spend time with Yoda, and do Jedi training?
Well yes, he did, but following Han Solo, Chewbacca and Leia was starting to get on my nerves. They seemed pretty unfocused.
Yeah, and then they got into trouble in Cloud City, when they hung out with Lando Calrissian. Though Billy Dee Williams was interesting.
I found the ending to be the most shocking thing, ever. Luke, losing his arm to Darth Vader, and Han being encased in carbonite - it was really too much for me.
It was the end of times. The seventies were over, the oil crisis past, the war in Vietnam complete - people didn't know what to expect, and "The Empire Strikes Back" reflected all of that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think that The Empire Strikes Back was the best Star Wars film. How about you?
Most definitely, Irvin Kershner added some darkness to the series.
I would have to say that Kershner was the best out of all the Star Wars directors.
I would agree, Lucas is probably my number two favorite.
I hope as the series continues, we see some darker storylines similar to Empire.
Yes, tragedy needs to remain a part of the ongoing saga.
What do you think about Han being killed in The Force Awakens?
I was disappointed. He was my favorite character.
Yes, mine too, they killed the coolest dude in the galaxy.
At least Chewbacca lives to carry on his legacy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hi there.
You like star wars?
Yes, I love star wars.
Nice, me too.
What is your favorite movie?
I like the first one?
From the old films?
Yeah.
A classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Chewie as a character in Star Wars.
I think he's simple yet.
Is that it?
Well I think he has a good heart and is an interesting character because of that.
He does the right things or tries to when he can.
Yes he does do the right thing most of the time.
Anything else?
He has an appearance most people would be afraid of.
That's true but he's not scary.
Not once you get to know him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite character from Rogue One?
I liked the K-2SO a lot. He was pretty funny.
Yes that movie had a very serious tone so it was good to have a comic relief character in the story.
Definitely. Some people say that his jokes seemed a little forced and shoehorned in but I disagree.
Is he your favorite droid overall from the Star Wars movies?
It's hard to say he's better than the awesome droids like C3PO or R2D2 of course. I wouldn't go so far as to say he was better but he was a good character.
Who did the voice for K-2O? Do you know?
Alan Tudyk actually did the voice for him. They also used motion capture so the actor actually acted out the role and not only used his voice.
That's impressive! I had no idea, I thought it was CGI or  a puppet or something.
Well it was CGI but they used the actual actor as a reference for the CGI so it looks very natural.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you like the star universe
I sort of do why
I need someone to talk about it with
Sure we can talk about it a little
Good so who is your favorite Hunter
Well it is hard to choose for me
I like jango he is pretty awesome
Jango was unique
The best in the franchise
might not go that far to be honest
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the new Star Wars movie?
Which one?
Rogue One.
Yes, that was terrific!
How about the one before that that just came out?
I did see the Force Awakens.  It was so cool!
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I love the new ones the best.  I'd say The Force Awakens.
Did you hear that Disney had bought Star Wars?
Yes, when we went to Disney they had cool things going on in their parks studios in regards to Star Wars.  I can't wait to visit there again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Star Wars movies?
They are okay.
Have you seen them all?
No, just a couple of them.
I really like them.
Who is your favorite character?
Probably C3PO.
Is that the robot?
It sure is.
Wow, I'm glad I knew that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is there anything about the Star Wars films that stands out to you the most?
If I had to choose one thing, I'd say the setting.
All of the different planets and things like that?
Exactly. The fact that the setting varies so much helps the series stay fresh.
Honest.y, I'd never thought of it like that.
Did you just value the aesthetics of it?
Pretty much. I just saw that the worlds looked pretty, and that's it.
I feel like seeing it the way that I just described helps keep interest in the films.
That makes sense. I might have to start thinking like that.
You might just find yourself enjoying movies a lot more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever watch the first trilogy back in the 80's I think it was.
Yeah but not at first.
Did you like the story plot?
I did actually I thought it was well done.
Yeah Luke getting learning how to control his powers It had all the iconic members like Yoda and more.
Like Vader the emperor Obi-Won so many awesome characters.
Yep and we got to learn about them the first time.
Yoda did the best job though.
He did do a good job playing the old wise guy.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen all of the Star Wars movies?
Yes, I have but only once.
What was your least favorite character?
Probably Jar Jar Binks.
There's a rumor he was supposed to be the ultimate villain for the second trilogy.
No way? That's crazy.
Right?
Yeah, very.
I agree.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The final Death Star scene in Return of the Jedi was intense
Yes, I agree. A lot of action and fighters flying around
There were some pretty cool new fighters in that scene.
Oh right, like the A-wing fighter.
Yes, and then the B-Wings.
I don't remember those
yeah, they weren't very prevalent.
I do remember Lando was piloting the Millennium Falcon in that one.
Yes I remember. Pretty good ship for a hunk of junk.
Ha, ha. That's right. It always seemed to perform well under pressure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
did you like the force awakens?
it was really cool
rey and finn were good
they did a very good job.
i wonder if we will see them a lot more
i think they will be in the new movie coming soon
when?
last i heard this year in 2017
oh that is awesome.
and we will see the sth again
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember in the star wars movies when luke gets his hand chopped off?
Yeah that was crazy
Or when Luke finds out Darth is his dad
I mean, everyone knows about that
Did you see the han solo got fired
I saw that. from the new movies
yes the new ones.
I like leia organa in those
IT's a pretty great character
Her being a general is the best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the Star Wars movies?
Yes, I have
Who is your favorite character?
Padme Amidala and Princess Leia.
Why? Both?
Because they are almost the same character.  Strong, brave, independant, smart female leaders.  They fall in love with brave, courageous men.
If you could be best friends with any character, who would it be?
I love R2D2!
Why?
He is funny, whitty, never failing at anything he does.  He is droid with a human personality.  He is not scared of anything.  Pushes his friends to be better.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I plan on watching the Star Wars films for the first time this weekend. Which movie should I start with?
Wow, you're probably the only person I know that hasn't seen Star Wars before.
My co-workers tease me about that all the time. I must be the only person in the world that still hasn't seen those movies.
Since you're new to the series, you might want to start out with Episode I: The Phantom Menace.
Wait. Someone else told me that I should watch episode IV first. The one from the 70s.
Don't listen to that guy. Trust me, you're better off watching the prequels first.
So, that's Episodes I, II, and III, right?
Yeah. Then you should watch the original trilogy in order.
Gotcha. But when should I squeeze in Rogue One?
Whenever. It's a side story, so it doesn't matter when you watch it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I liked most of them but at the moment Star Wars: The Force Awakens is my favorite.
What did you like most about it?
I liked Rey
What did you like most about Rey?
Here energy and intensity. What is your favorite Star Wars movie?
I liked Star Wars: The Force Awakens as well and for the same reasons you like it. Did you like Rogue One?
I didn't care for it as much as other movies. I think the acting was great, but I had a hard time engaging with the plot.
Are you excited to see The Last Jedi?
Yes, I can hardly wait to see Rey again and what happens with her and Luke in this next movie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, yeah, I love Star Wars, but even I have to admit, George Lucas can't write romantic dialogue.
Oh, I know, the Padme and Anakin relationship just did NOT work at all.
Yeah but what do you expect from a sixty year old divorced millionaire?
Well, certainly something better than a guy comparing the woman he loves to sand.
Oh, man, what that was bad!  (dead voice) I don't like sand.... it's coarse... it's rough and it get into everything.
Personally, I just find the whole premise that have attachment to a woman is what turns him to the dark side.
Well, it's kind of a like a "Jedi's as monks" kind of thing.
I think you're giving it waaay too much credit.  I would have gone with the "ambition and uncontrollable anger even with the best of intentions" being Anakin's downfall.
Well, they did show he had a bit of a temper in the second film.
Yeah, by have him immediately start whining Padme within five minutes of them meeting each other again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, who's your favorite female character in Star Wars?
There aren't that many options, Leia or Amadala.
So who's your favorite?
Has anyone ever said Amadala?
Not yet.
Leia is my favorite female character.
Why?
Because my only other choice is Amydala and she sucked.
What did she do that was so horrible?
She married Darth Vader!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think is the worst character in all of the Star Wars movies?
Jar Jar Binks is obviously the worst.  He character was so cheesy.
I definitely disliked his whole storyline. It could have been handled much differently.
Did you know that Michael Jackson was originally supposed to play Jar Jar?
No way! That would have been creepy.
Maybe it would have made it better?
Nothing could have made that character better in my opinion.
What if he didn't talk in that crazy voice?
That would have definitely helped, I was kind of annoyed with how all of the Gungans talked.
Maybe its that whole species that just needed to be redone.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Jabba the Hutt?
Yes, he is very funny in Return of the Jedi.
Wasn't he in the first one?
Not originally, but in the updated one yes.
He looks a lot different doesn't he?
Yeah, he's not a puppet in part 1, but he is in part 3.
I wondered why it looked so different.
Was he always supposed to be a big worm looking guy?
Actually there was an actor who played him originally.
Wow, I did not know that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think the final side film for Star Wars will be about?
I hope Boba Fett.
Yeah, I always wondered what happened to him.
Yeah, and he was a total stud too.
I like how we saw him in the prequels.
Yeah, and how he had a tragic death of his father effect him.
Yeah but his father had it coming.
He doesn't care about that.  That was his origin story.
That would make for an awesome movie.
Yeah, it would make for some good gap filling.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How did you like how they reintroduced old characters in The Force Awakens?
It was great, especially that they had so many of the original cast involved.
We got to see how some of the characters had evolved, in particular Han and Leia.
For me it was really most interesting how they were indicating that Luke was really important.
Too bad we only got to see him at the end of the movie, I hope they have a grand story arc planned.
I guess, only time will tell.
How did you enjoy Kylo Ren as a villain?
He just came off as a pawn in the grand scheme of things.
Indeed, I really hope they will add some more depth into the villain in the upcoming movie.
There was so much opportunity wasted with how they portrayed the villains.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, so if you had to pick, what do you think is your favorite Star Wars movie?
Wow, that's a tough question! But if I had to pick, it would have to be The Empire Strikes Back.
Oh, good choice! There is so much great stuff in that movie!
I know! Yoda, AT-ATs, Luke and Vader's lightsaber battle...
Oh, for sure. I think my favorite aspect of the movie is the AT-ATs on Hoth. They are just so cool and iconic.
I know exactly what you mean! They really allow the notion of how powerful the Empire real is to hit home.
For sure! And, I mean Yoda too?! He is the best! Maybe one of the best characters in the entire Star Wars Universe!
I couldn't agree more! Frank Oz was just a complete genius!
Oh, totally! You have to wonder if they can ever top Empire!
Well, I'm not sure, but I definitely wouldn't mind them trying!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't believe Kylo Ren killed Han Solo.
That was a devastating scene.
I wonder if Kylo will redeem himself before the trilogy ends.
I'd like to think so.  Redemption is always a powerful device in film.
Do you think he is too far gone?  Han's murder may have been the moral event horizon.
It very well may have been, but maybe Kylo will team up with Rey against Snokes.
That is always a possibility.  It seems as if they are building up Snokes to be the main villain.
And we still don't know what the deal with Luke is.
Do you think Luke may have nefarious plans or intentions?
I guess we will find out later this year when the next movie comes out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember the bar scene in STAR WARS?
Yes. It had all those scary monsters.
They were aliens not monsters.
There was a band. They looked like aliens.
Greedo was green and like a fish or reptile.
None of them looked happy.
There was a roundish fuzzy guy.
Hammer head was there also.
They would not let droids in.
That's so racist.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which character did you find most annoying in Star Wars?
C3PO-- I always thought he was such a coward.
You know what's funny?  Before I saw the movies, I only had the figures, and since he was gold, I figured he was the best.
Haha, far from it.  Which character did you find to be most annoying?
Definitely Jar Jar.
Yeah, he single handedly ruined the Phanton Menace.
Only a character as moronic as Jar Jar could ruin a movie with Darth Maul.
The fight scene with him taking on Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan is the only redeeming thing about that movie.  And, Watto.
You like Watto?
Yeah! He was cute in a weird way, and kinda funny.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just saw Rogue One.
Neat!  Any of the old crew show up?
No, all new characters.
Who was your favorite?
Felicity Jones was super hot!
What role did she play?
She was Jyn Erso, who was recruited to rescue her dad Galen, who helped design the Death Star.
What happens in the end?
Jalen steals the schematics to the Death Star and gets them to Princess Leia, but dies.
Terrible!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer older or newer Star Wars movies?
I prefer the older ones.
Me too. The empire strikes back was great.
Which of the characters are your favorites?
Carrie Fisher as Leia has always been my favorite. And yours?
Luke Skywalker, for everything that he represents in the movies.
What do you see as his main role in the movies?
He is the underdog with a courage to stand up against an overwhelming force.
Do you think he will be an important element in the newest upcoming Star Wars movie?
Yes, I believe so. He is the last Jedi and he's been trying to reestablish the Jedi order.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the specail effects in the Star Wars movies?
Yes, I watch the movies to see the specail effects.
Do you perfer the old movies or the new movies?
I like both sets of movies.
I think that the newest Star Wars movies have the best specail effects.
I agree, but the old set still looks real good.
Thats true, the older movies have a kind of appeal to them.
The old set have a kind of nostalgic value.
Definitly. but I still perfer the newer movies.
I have no perference between the sets.
