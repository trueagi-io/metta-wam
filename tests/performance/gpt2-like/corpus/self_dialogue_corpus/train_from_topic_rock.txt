Do you like the Beatles last album,Abbey road?
I love it.
Me too. Could be their best.
Yea,imagine the last album you,do considered the best.
Tough to pick one as the best though.
I agree,they had so many classics.
I,think every one was a classic!
You know,I can't say I disagree.
They changed music forever.
Yes they did. Great rockers!
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did you first listen to rock
My mom used to play it all the time when I was little, so I just got used to it
Really? What bands did she listen to?
Most 80's stuff, she loved Journey.
Wow I'm a big Journey fan! Whats your favorite song?
Girl can't help it has a special place in my heart
Thats one of my favorites too.
Whats your favorite song? Do you have one?
It sounds cliche, but I love Don't Stop Believin'
I can't blame you, its such an iconic song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go out to dinner with me tonight?
I would, but I'm really broke.
I can pay for you, I have a new side venture and I've been making quite a bit of money selling stuff on ebay.
What are you selling?
I had a lot of old concert tshirts from when I used to go to concerts all the time. Even though they are used and old, people are willing to pay good money for them.
Really? What kind of money?
I sold an L7 tshirt for $60 last week.This week I put up a Def Lepard shirt for 15, one from The Cranberries for 25, and a rare Collective Soul shirt I got 35 for.
Wow. I have a bunch of old concert tshirts too, maybe I should try that.
90s alternative bands are really popular. I must have a dozen Smashing Pumpkins tshirts, and they fetch a good price, but I'm hanging on to those cause I really like that band.
I have several Metallica tshirts I never wear cause they're too small now, I should auction those off.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have been finding more rock bands I like lately.
What makes a band stand out for you?
I like when they really sing instead of just yelling or growling.
So which bands do you think do that?
Shinedown is an example.
Oh, I love them. Brent is a great singer.
I agree. He has talent.
The best song is 'If You Only Knew.'
That one is good. I love lots of their songs, though.
They are one of my favorite bands as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that the rock band Poison was from Mechanicsberg , Pa. ?
No I didn't.
Too bad we didn't get to meet them growing up.
They lived so close to us. Too bad they moved.
They had some great songs.
They had some of my favorite songs.
Talk Dirty to Me was the best of all times.
Don't forget I Want Action.
Love that one too.
Bret Michaels has a great voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a 311 fan?
I have heard a few of their songs and as best I recall I liked them.
You probably remember Amber on the radio. Most people do especially girls.
yes you are right that is a song I remember.
Their song India Ink from their last album that came out was one of my favorites. They just put out a new album Called Mosaic
I don't know much but the ones on the radio from years ago
You should check out India Ink and see what you think
I might. They do remind me of  other bands I like.
Yes they have a reggae sound at times.
who is that band I am thinking of.....oh well can't recall ...oh wait it's Sublime
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hello.
Are you a fan or rock?
Like rock music?
Yeah.
Yep, love rock.
Cool, who are some of your favorite bands?
Well I'm a child of the sixties and seventies so I like a lot of bands from then.
Like who?
The Who, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to listen to Rock music?
Yeah I love listening to The Cars.
Oh I have their greatest hits album.
What is your favorite song by them?
Just What I Needed.
That song is played so much on commercials.
That is very true, I hear it all of the time.
Well it was great talking to you.
I agree!
Let us do this again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the best rock artist of all time?
I would have to say, Elvis.
What? He is not a Rock guy.
He was one of the first, Rock and Roll.
Well, how about as of late?
Maybe Kurt Cobain.
He and Nirvana were really groundbreaking.
Teen Spirit is one of my favorite songs.
I like the way the mixed genres a bit.
Added just a bit of pop in with the rock.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish we'd hear more rock on mainstream radio.
I agree, there are so many bands though that how do you choose what to play?
I don't know, it's just a bummer to me to hear obvious radio hits not make it to radio.
Yeah, stuff like Here Comes My Man by Gaslight Anthem would have been huge if it got airplay.
And that's what I'm talking about, I don't mind that I don't discover artists on the radio, it's just a shame.
The music landscape is so different anyway, most people are listening and discovering on Spotify.
Yeah but there's so many artists on there that a good rock band will get lost in the shuffle.
I hear what you're saying, you want these rock bands on the radio alongside the pop acts.
Exactly, because so many rock bands like Gaslight and Jamie T have hit hooks.
I guess we'll see if any of them ever break through.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of rock do you like
I'm a fan of alternative rock
Oh, I mostly listen to oldies stuff
How old
Mostly stuff from the 70's and 80s. Bands like KISS or AC/DC
Wow, thats the kind of stuff my parents like
Yeah, I grew up with it so thats why I like it. Whats your favorite band?
I love green day
Oh i love American Idiot!
Me too thats my favorite song!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Radiohead?
I think they are one of the most important bands of our generation.
Why do you say that?
Their sound and lyrics were groundbreaking and influential.
Who is the singer and frontman for the band?
His name is Thom Yorke.
He is from England, isn't he?
Yes, have you heard about his side projects?
No! He is in other bands too?
Yes! Check out the group "Atoms for Peace"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man, Bleachers is one of the best things to come out of New Jersey in a long time.
Yeah Jersey seems to have something in the water down there in terms of music, and Bleachers is another example.
Yeah you're right, Jersey seems to produce amazing rock music.
Maybe it's the blue collar culture that Jersey has.
I'd say so, all started with Bruce Springsteen and went from there.
Yep, there's an undeniable level of quality out of that state.
But anyway back on Bleachers, their new album, Gone Now, is stupendous.
I have only heard Don't Take The Money off of it, glad to hear the rest is great.
Oh it's better than great, and Don't Take The Money is the song of the summer.
That I can totally see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard any good new rock lately?
Yes. Unleash the Archers has a newer song that I particularly like. Have you heard of them?
No. What do they sound like?
They are more of a metal band.
I might check them out. Are there any songs I should listen to?
Cleanse the Bloodlines is a good song.
I'll definitely take a listen.
Awesome. What kind of rock bands do you normally listen to?
I generally listen to more foreign bands. Japanese Rock actually.
That's interesting. I've heard of Baby Metal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you like George Harrison?
Love George. Loved the Beatles.
George was a great rock guitar player.
He had a unique style I liked.
I thought something was one,of the most beautiful songs ever written.
Didn't Frank Sinatra say that?
He did,but I think he gave credit to Lennon and McCartney.
He did,but obviously George wrote it.
Beautiful song indeed.
It's been covered by a lot of rock bands over time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the Foo Fighters?
I think so! That's Dave Grohl's band, right?
You're correct. He is the lead singer.
I've heard a few songs. But I don't know many.
What have you heard by them?
I think I have only heard the songs called Hero & Learn To Fly
Those are early songs. They are good songs, but the band has released much more music.
Good to know. I'll have to look up some of the more recent tracks.
Best of You is a great song too. Make sure to check that one out.
Awesome, thank you. I'll listen to it today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How many songs can you name from the 1980's?
Hmm, let's see. Well I was a huge Cyndi Lauper fan, so the first song that comes to mind is "Girls Just Want To Have Fun".
I almost forgot about the crazy costumes and hair do's.
Remember "Boy George" what was the name of the band he was in?
Culture Club, I used to go for walks singing Karma Chameleon.
Let's not forget Michael Jackson was breaking out on his own. He had Beat It and the moon walk. So amazing.
I never did master the moon walk but I did learn the Thriller dance.
That's not something I even want to see, but I could have watched him dance all day long.
He was the best. His song were so good. It's a shame he is not still here.
I would have loved to see what else he would have done with all of that talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite band?
I really love Metallica!
Do you like the old Metallica or the new stuff better?
I really prefer the old style so much more.
Yes,me too!
My favorite song is Fade to Black,Which song do you like?
I really like the song The day that never comes.Not sure if the new or old style.
Yes I saw the video makes you think about stuff.
I used to listen to it alot back when I was in college.
That's awesome.Seems like we like the same music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey there.
Do you dig rock music?
Yeah I listen to a fair bit of it.
Favorite band?
Of all time?
Yeah sure.
I would have to go with Led Zeppelin.
Great choice.
One of the best bands of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to the Foo Fighters often?
Not really, but they are a good band.
Dave Grohl is really underrated as a musician.
What do you mean?
I mean, he was in one of the biggest bands of all time and he's still making music.
Oh, you mean Nirvana?
Yeah.  I'm surprised that Foo Fighters aren't bigger than they are.
How would you top Nirvana though?
Did you know that Grohl was the drummer for Nirvana?
Yeah.  I wonder if he knew how to play the guitar back then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band do you think is best on stage?
I saw Aerosmith in concert and their stage set up was awesome! I looked like a hotel and the name Charlotte was in neon.
What band is in your CD player right now?
I enjoy Jackyl mostly; good driving tunes.
When you are getting ready to hit the town, who is your choice band to listen to.
I love old rock music. I am a huge fan of the Rolling Stones.
What was the last rock concert you attended?
I got to see Joan Jett.
What do you think we should listen to together?
Let's listen to some Tom Petty and chill out awhile.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you feel rock music nowadays compares to the old stuff?
Absolutely not, the classics are always better.
I would tend to agree, there's exceptions, but they just don't make them like they used to.
Yeah give me Bad Company, Reo Speedwagon and Kansas over modern stuff anyday.
Speaking of Kansas did you know Anthrax covered Carry On my Wayward son?
Really interesting how was it?
Really good actually, almost sounds like it's Kansas.
Will have to check it out, I've heard Gwar's rather original version of the song.
Now that's a unique twist in it.
You're not kidding, it sure was.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So sad about the death of Chris Cornell. Really loved Soundgarden.
Me too! I loved the "Big Seattle Four" rock bands from that era.
Those bands really changed our generation, and changed rock music.
Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. What a group.
So talented. What's your favorite rock song?
Probably Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden. You?
Black by Pearl Jam.
Can't go wrong with Eddie Vedder.
He's the only frontman from the Big Four still alive!
Yes let's wrap him in bubble wrap.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Nirvana would be a big deal if they came out today?
Maybe, it's hard to tell.
I don't think they would be a big deal today.
Why not?
All new music has to have some attractive singer.
Kurt Cobain was considered attractive.
I still don't think he would be hot enough to sell records.
It's about the music not about their looks.
Then explain Taylor Swift to me if it's about the music.
You got me there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the bass player of Metallica?
Robert Trujillo is.
Has he always been?
No, they had Cliff Burton and Jason Newstead too.
Did they fire them?
No Jason quit and Cliff was killed in a bus wreck.
That's sad, were they all on the bus?
I think so.
Didn't Dave Mustaine used to play for them?
Yes he did!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who is your favorite rock band?
I'm going to go old-school and say AC/DC.
Really? Mine's Nirvana.
Nirvana is really good too.
Brian Johnson from AC/DC does have a very unique voice.
Yeah, his vocals on "Back in Black" are so raspy and unique.
They are good, but I just love Kurt Cobain's song writing.
He was definitely talented. Nirvana completely changed rock music.
They kickstarted the grunge era. Too bad it didn't last longer.
Yeah, it's been a long time since I've heard a convincing rock album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to listen to rock music ever?
Yeah I have been listening to Pat Benatar.
Oh cool, I love the song Shine by her.
That is a great song.
It has been on my playlist for a long time.
I can see why.
What else do you like?
I like Bridge to Grace.
What song?
Wipeout Turn.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know metallica was formed by a newspaper ad
Really
Yea Lars put an add in the local newspaper
Thats so cool
I know
Who would have thought by putting an ad in the paper they would bexome famous
I bet they never dreamed of that
Probably not
Just shows dreams do come true
Exactly
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really like classic rock music. How about you?
I tend to like the early rock music from the 50's.  I mean that was a turning point in the music industry.
Early rock in roll, I liked Elvis Presley.
Yes, yes yes, Blue Suede shoes was my all time favorite song by Elvis.
It was definitely a song to dance too but my favorite was Jail House Rock.
Did you like Mr. Chuck Berry at all?
i do like Chuck Berry especially Johnny B Good.
He was such an icon to rock in roll and so was Buddy Holly.
The day Buddy Holly died was surreal and as I understand it really put a cut into rock and roll.
Definitely, just as it did when Elvis overdosed.  The hurt was everywhere.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Weird to think that the Foo Fighters wouldn't exist if Kurt Cobain didn't kill himself.
I used to love Nirvana, but really like the foo fighters too.
I miss grunge music.
Pearl Jam has always been my favorite.
I wish I lived in Seattle back in the day.
I was really shocked to hear that Chris Cornell died.
I'm going to miss Soundgarden.
Just everything about music coming out of there in that decade was amazing.
Rock music is dying.
I agree. Very few new acts that focus on rock and roll.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Where would Foo Fighters be without Cobain's suicide?
They would have eventually came together
So you think the band would have broken up?
No but guys do side projects all the time
So it just would have started later than how they are noq
Yeah we would have waited for songs like Monkey Wrench
I think Big Me is a better track in my opinion.
You could think that but I dont know how true it is
I loved the entire album
Grohl was a better front man than he was a drummer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Metal band?
I like Def Leppard!
Yes, they are great. But, they are kind of soft.
Okay, for Heavy Metal, I like Judas Priest!
Now, you are talking! I saw them one time.
How was it?
It was a typical rock music kind of of show.
What does that mean?
You know, things like women dancing on a stage covered with lights and fog.
That sounds amazing! We should see if any rock music artists are on tour this summer.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite grunge band was Nirvana.
Mine, too.  My husband and my song is "Smells Like Teen Spirit."
You know that's a deodorant, right?  How'd that happen.
We were dating, he was at my apartment and the video came on MTV.  He was like: "Boom. This is our song."
That's kinda crazy, but cool.  What's your favorite album.
Nevermind, but I have them all.  Kobain's voice was so edgy and angsty.
I miss Curt Kobain.  Wonder what he'd be doing now.
I wonder.  Don't really follow the other band members.
Classic rock is the best!
When did 1991 become 'classic'?  Dude, we're old!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock bands do you like?
I loved the Stones, lots of classic hits.
Hard to believe they are still touring and playing.  Still have a lot of appeal of the songs from their glory days.  Like Ruby Tuesday for instance.
I loved to listen to them on my 8 tracks.  I had one in the garage run by a battery charger and one in my car.  Listened to the stones, Eric Clapton and some Elvis.
I liked Neil Diamond too, sweet Caroline among others.
We used to ride around in the car and listen to 8 tracks like "Paint It Black" or Tommy from "The Who".
Sure it was easy to ride around, gas was cheap and you could listen to your trade a tape like Neil Diamond or the latest artists.
The care free days were so cool, it seemed like the hits would keep coming but so many of the bands broke up like the Beatles.
And they moved on to other things, formed independants and struck off on their own like happened to the Byrds.
Sure, they had a song "eight miles high" that was supposed to be about flying but everyone thought was about drugs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think CCR is a good rock band?
I think they're a great rock band. Love their rock music.
They've had a lot of hits.
Yes they have.
Cosmos factory is my favorite album.
Probably my favorite too.
Did you know they played at Woodstock?
Yes,who'll stop the rain was written about Woodstock.
Oh,I wasn't aware of that.
Yes,John fogarty wrote it right after the Woodstock weekend
XXXXXXXXXXX
The Beach Boys are one of my favorite all time bands.
Would you consider them rock music?
Well, technically they are what you'd call "Bubblegum Rock" and they were still in the early years of rock music.
Anyways, what makes you like them?
Well, for one thing I like how they use their harmonies together. And they sound like they have so much fun singing together.
Like in "Barbara Ann?"
Yes, like that. They also have a fun way of singing about cars.
That's true - though some of the time I have to look up the terminology they use.
Like "pink slip" and "four on the floor"?
Yes, and "flat head mill".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dang, rock seems to be dead today!
You are wrong about that.
Why do you say that?
I am going to see At The Drive-In today.
That band is still around?
Indeed. You should get some tickets.
I don't know if I have money. Do they have any new music?
Yes they do. They just made a new album.
I think it might be worth checking them out. I loved them back in the day.
So did I. The new album is just as good as the old stuff.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love that old time rock n' roll.
Hahaha. Bob Seger.  He did some great songs. I loved Turn The Page.
Yeah, that is an all time classic.  Every rock band has to do at least one great ballad.
So what are some of your favorites?
Not many people seem to have heard this one, but Black Sabbath did Solitude on their Black album.  I love it.
I never heard that one.  I'll have to look it up.
So what is one of your favorite ballads?
How about Whitesnake, Is This Love?
Oh man, yes, that is a great rock ballad. Did you like Journey's Open Arms?
Oh yeah.  That's a great, too. It was with a fantastic clip in the movie Heavy Metal.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite genera of rock music?
I like hair metal from the 80s.
You mean bands like Motley Crue and Poison?
Yeah, I really like Motley Crue.
Kick start my heart is my favorite song from them.
That is a jam.
Did you know Tommy Lee was married to Pamela Anderson?
I think everyone knows that.
I think he was married to Heather Locklear too.
Heather Locklear is now married to Richie Sambora from Bon Jovi now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite oldies band.
Creedence Clearwater Revival.
They were pretty awesome.
Yeah, I hear 'em on the radio all the time.
They're still popular!
Not on the kids stations, now.
I figured.
Would have been cool to watch them live.
My dad went to one of their concerts.
Lucky dude!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to the eagles?
Yes,love their music.
Hotel California is my favorite.
Mine too. The album and the song.
Yes. To bad about Glen Frey passing. He was young.
It's a shame. I think the eagles are still going to tour.
I hope,they do but it won't be the same.
Never will be.
Wonder if they're write any new songs.
I don't know. Maybe don Henley will
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band has a great drummer?
They all have great drummers.
Which is your favorite?
Mitch Mitchell from Jimi Hendrix
Is he a jazz drummer?
His style is very jazzy.
Jimi Hendrix was awesome.
Yes. He is the greatest guitarist ever.
I think Eric Clapton is up there too.
Definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think rock music is getting old.
I do, I hear so many songs played over and over again.
Do you think the radios should play less played rock songs?
I do. Some songs people never hear from a band.
Do you think this would make rock music more popular again.
I do. I think it would not be so repetitive.
Would you drive a campaign with radio stations to play less popular songs?
I would love to start a campaign to promote this.
What stations would you start with, locally or nationally?
I think I would start locally, and work from there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite 80's rock band?
I have many that I love, but my favorite is probably Queen.
Weren't they popular in the 70's too?
Yes, and they are still touring now.
I thought that the lead singer passed away, didn't he?
Yes, Freddie Mercury died in 1991. So many people miss him so much!
I remember what a great voice he had. I love that song called We Will Rock You!
I loved his voice too and he was so talented. Adam Lambert has been touring with Queen recently as the lead singer.
I like Adam Lambert's voice as well, but nothing can compare to Freddie Mercury's voice.
I agree. He was one of the best rock singers of all times in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Yo dude
Whatcha doing
Playing some rock band
What is that
it is a game where you play some rock music
What are you playing
Some good ol megadeath
Sounds awesome how bout i join
That would be cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music?
Love rock and roll.
Who's your favorite band?
The stones are.
I love the stones too.
Sympathy for the devil is my favorite song.
That's a great song.
Amazing Keith Richards is still around,lol!
Oh my god yea.
Still smokes cigs on stage.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Found some of my old cassettes in the attic.
Really, what bands did you have?
Do you remember the Cars?
Of course.
What was your favorite song?
You might think.
I liked that too.
What was your favorite song?
Let's Go.
That song is great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss hair metal from the '80s. There's just nothing quite like it being made nowadays.
Many of those bands are still around, and some are still making new music. You just have to look a little harder for them.
Oh really? Like who?
Styx just released a new album, so did Cheap Trick and Deep Purple.
Wow, I love all of those bands. I'll have to look into this!
You can always tune into Dee Snider's radio show too. Its called House of Hair, and it airs on many XM stations.
I'll have to check it out!
Yeah, if you're a fan of that genre of rock, you really should.
Do you  have any other recommendations?
You can always use Spotify to test out some of these new albums.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best era for rock music?
Probably the 90's. There were so many good rock bands and songs that came about during that time.
I agree. I remember that's when I first was really exposed to rock and I loved it.
Yea, like we grew up with that music. Bands like Weezer, Nirvana, Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Oasis were so good.
I miss that era of rock. I don't even know what is considered rock music these days.
A lot of modern rock is like more indie sounding or has a lot of additional electronic effects.
I feel like recently there hasn't been like a really good new rock band to come out of the past few years.
Yea, I mean there's been some new artists that are pretty good, but nothing compares to 90's rock.
I guess though that strictly "rock" music isn't as popular as it was during the 90's and early 2000's.
Yea it's like more electronica and pop type of stuff these days.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of rock music do you like?
I like AC/DC and Metallica.
I'm more of a Megadeth fan myself.
Did you know Dave Mustaine used to play guitar for Metallica?
I didn't know that.
They kicked him out because of his excessive drinking.
That must have been really bad considering it was Metallica.
Yeah, there was animosity for years, but they seem to be on good terms now.
Age mellows us all.
Indeed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
wanna go to a rock concert?
depends, who's playing?
two of my favorite bands! metric and imagine dragons. some girl named halsey is opening.
halsey? haven't heard of her. metric is pretty good, though.
not a fan of imagine dragons?
i could do without them. they remind me of twenty-one pilots. just some wannabe emo stuff.
yikes, okay. so i guess i won't invite you to the twenty-one pilots concert.
yeah, that's probably for the best.
what about metric, though?
metric i can do. do you think they'll play lost kitten?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know Foo Fighters is releasing a new album??
No! I didn't know that, I love them...glad you told me about this.
I figured you may want to know since you love Dave Grohl so much.
I know, I've been a fan since his Nirvana days.
Don't you wish 90's rock style were still being made??
Definitely. That era of rock is my absolute favorite. Rage Against the Machine started then too.
Now that is a great band, I should have gone to see them when I had the chance.
I've seen them live once, one of the best shows of my life.
I'm so jealous!! I didn't know they would split up.
Maybe they'll do a reunion show one day. I would definitely go see them again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to go see Queen this summer.
Are they touring?
Yes and they're in Philadelphia.
Do you really want to see Queen or Adam Lambert?
That's funny, but actually both.
Queen had so many memorable songs.
We Will Rock You was associated with so many things when we were young.
Yes it was.
Adam Lambert is a great front man for them.
He is, he has an excellent voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Could Aerosmith still perform if they wanted?
Sure but I think Steven Tyler is so old now he couldnt handle it.
I still remember hearing Crazy for the first time.
I still remember seeing the video or it.
They had his daughter in a bunch of his videos.
Yeah and they had the duo with Run DMC.
That was a song meant to appeal to other fans in different genres
Did it serve its purpose?
I never heard anyone who liked rap say they started listening to Aerosmith
I guess the same could be said for the other side too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Iggy Pop?
Who is Iggy Pop?
He is an American singer. He is awesome!
Where is he from?
He is from Michigan.
What are some of his famous songs?
He had tracks like "The Passenger" & "Lust For Life'
What kind of music does he play?
He plays punk rock, glam rock, and things like that.
I am a fan of those genres. I am excited to check him out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
One thing we have in common is our enjoyment of rock music.
For sure! What was your favorite rock band growing up?
Linkin Park comes to mind, at the moment. How about you?
I really enjoyed KoRn, when I was in middle school. Linkin Park was great, too.
Whenever I hear KoRn, I instantly think of middle school, when I was 14 or so.
I feel the same way with Linkin Park. What was your favorite album by them?
The album that had "Crawling" on it. I believe it was Hybrid Theory?
Yes I think you are right and that is a classic album! "Issues" is my favorite KoRn album.
Did that have "Make Me Bad" on it? That's my all-time favorite song by them.
I believe it did, yes. That song is truly a classic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, I've been listening to a lot of Alice In Chains lately.
Oh yeah, I love them, such great harmonies.
Jerry and Lane, their voices just mesh so well, some songs are so haunting.
I know, the Jar of Flies album is full of dark thoughts, which we know are Lane's.
I can't believe he and the drummer are both dead, and all because of stupid drugs.
Yep, did you ever see Mike Starr on Dr. Drew's Celebrity Rehab?
I did, you know both guys must have really been in a lot of emotional pain.
Yes, and you know, the songs really tell us that, don't they?  Down In A Hole is one of my favorites.
I love Rooster, and oh yeah, Whale and Wasp is super haunting.
I agree, I still enjoy checking out Jerry Cantrell's music, I just really miss Lane.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who'd be your favorite Canadian band?
I didn't know there were any!
Get real!
Name one.
Rush.
Oh, I had no idea.
They're my favorite bad, period.
They were pretty dang good.
Geddy Lee has such an amazing voice.
Agreed!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock music genre?
I've always been partial towards anything fast and aggressive.
Couldn't agree more, thrash metal, punk, hardcore, just needs that edge.
Absolutely it needs to get near want to be moving, I guess punk would be my absolute favorite though.
Mine as well, what's your favorite all time punk band?
It would have to be The Misfits.
Walk Among Us has to be one of the more catchy albums I've ever heard.
It really is, a rare album I never tire of.
Did you get to Riot Fest for their reunion show?
I wish I had, but I'm optimistic that Danzig will play more shows with them, too much money to be made.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the first band you liked?
Nirvana
Who is your favorite band now?
I love Elton John
Cool, is he a rock artist?
Yes, he does a lot of rock songs.
What song do you like of his?
Something About the Way You Look Tonight
Is that a romantic song?
Yes and it has a great rock feel to it too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think that Alternative rock music rose to prominence in the 1990s?
You mean the "Seattle Sound"?
Yes, music artists like Pearl Jam and Nirvana.
It is kind of strange, isn't it? It was really just a local rock music scene. Then, it exploded!
I have a theory about it.
What's that theory?
People got burned out on the the Glam Metal bands of the 1980s. They were tired of the spandex and makeup.
I can see that. The Grunge style of the rock music genre is relatively simple.
Yes, I think that simplicity made it come across as more "real".
Yes, authenticity is the key to success in the rock music genre.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock band of all time?
There are too many from which to select although at least 3 are my favorites.
I agree but The Eagles probably do it for me. So does Lynyrd Skynrnd and the Doobie Brothers
Why the Eagles as #1?
Because they were the first to turn country into country rock. Their melodies were incredible.
I agree I can listen to "Take it Easy" any time of the night or day. So cool.
I also think the band improved when they added Joe Walsh in 1977.
Oh, no doubt. He had such a great solo career before then and he added a harder version to the band.
He was a fantastic addition. You know Joe always is in the top 50 guitarists per Rolling Stone magazine.
His work on Hotel California was legendary for sure. Even better guitarist than the founders.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about rock music?
I love it! It is all that I listen too.
Me too, who are some of your favorites?
Well, being from NJ I would have to say that Bruce Springsteen is definitely one of them.
Yea, he is good. But I still prefer the bands like Credence Clearwater Revival, Marshall Tucker and the good old Southern Rock Bands.
Heard it in a Love Song was one of my favorite Marshall Tucker Songs.
Oh mine too! And Down on the corner by CCR.
Yea that had such great songs back then.
They sure did, that is why people are still listening to them today.
You are so right!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like newer or older rock bands?
I like some of both.
Me too.
I think I like listening to ACDC the most.
I am a big fan of that band.
Their music is somewhat timeless, they have been rocking forever.
I agree.  It seems like people of all ages like their music.
What is your favorite album?
Back in Black.
That is mine too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Radiohead?
I know a few of their songs, such as Creep. Do you listen to them?
Yeah they are my favorite band. Creep is a decent song but the album it was one wasn't the best.
Wasn't it their first album?
Exactly. Their next album, The Bends, was a much better effort. You should listen to it!
I will, but I have to be honest the lead singer's voice is somewhat annoying.
A lot of people say that. It takes a little getting used to. But give the album a chance I think you'll like it.
Oh! Is this the album with Fake Plastic Trees on it?
It is! That song has great lyrics!
I agree... it's one of my favorites from the 90's
XXXXXXXXXXX
Blue Oyster Cult came through last year.
I wish I had known!
Would you have gone?
For sure.
They are a pretty cool band.
Indeed. "More cowbell!"
Ha! But I heard the lead singer kind of rude.
Huh!
My brother tried to give him a high five  and got completely snubbed.
That's too bad....
XXXXXXXXXXX
Today i bought a brand new electric guitar from Sam Ash Music store
thats great i love the guitar its my favorite instrument.
me too i love the sound it stands alone in a band.
So, what kind of guitar did you get from SAM ash?
i am a beginner so i got the Fender starter pack.
whats comes with the starter pack
it comes with everything you need for a guitar it even has the amp with it.
how much money did you spend for everything
just 149.99 with tax at Sam Ash you should check it out.
thats a good prices, maybe i will check them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I agree Cobain was great. However, I don't think you can beat the rock music from the 1960's or 1970's.
Who is your favorite?
One of my all time favorites was Queen. Bohemian Rhapsody is classic song. Freddie Mercury as the lead was unbeatable.
I love that song. I love however how Adam Lambert sings it today with Queen.
Yes, he's good and he has a lot of charisma. But, in terms of charisma, nobody can top Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones
All right I agree that and the library of music they created is amazing and still so viable today. All age groups know Satisfaction and It's Only Rock and Roll
There are so many great ones from that era such as the Beatles, Led Zeppelin,The Who, Creedence Clearwater, the Grateful Dead, Fleetwood Mac and even the Beach Boys.
I agree with your list and it doesn't even cover all of them. However the list from today is also impressive.
Who are your favorites from this decade?
There are so many but some of my favorites are Imagine Dragon, U2 and Red Hot Chili Peppers. I think both eras have a lot of spectacuiar groups.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, do you think Tool is actually working on a new album?
I'll believe it when I see it.
Well, supposedly the drummer and the bassist said they've been in the studio.
But Maynard denies it, but he's kind of a jerk anyways, so I don't think I believe him.
10,000 days came out....when? 2006?
Yeah. I think we're due for a new album. Its only been 11 years.
I'd like a new album from A Perfect Circle too.
Me too! I saw them on tour recently, and it was so good! Very atmospheric.
What's your favorite song of theirs?
I'd have to say "3 Libras"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to every listen to rock music?
Yeah I have been listening lately to Little Black Backpack.
Oh is that by Stroke 9?
Yeah.
That is a decent song.
What do you like?
I like Default.
What song?
Throw It All Away.
Nice choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember The Wallflowers?
Oh, Bob Dylan's son.
Yeah.  They pretty much had their heyday in the 90's and disappeared.
'One Headlight' is one of my favorite songs.
There were plenty of good songs from that album.  What was it called?
Bringing Down the Horse.
That's right.  Whatever happened to them?
Like most bands, they just kind of faded away from the limelight.
That's a shame.  Would be better than most music these days.
Completely agree, but what do you do?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what kind of rock do you like?
Classic rock all the way. I just saw Gunsn Roses in concert
Oh yeah, I heard they were back together. Have they released anything new
No but they are doing a killer version of November Rain live
I have their Appetite for Destruction album, I like it
It's my favorite, you should check out The Spaghetti Incident too. I think you would like the acoustic numbers
Okay, I'll download it. I just downloaded Bruce Springsteens's greatest hits too
I love Bruce. Streets of Philadelphia is amazing
Yep. His early stuff is less commercial but great too
I haven't heard much of it. Thanks for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you like classic rock?
i love it!
me too. i love rediscovering old classic rock songs i loved growing up
like what? gimme an example!
have you ever seen the rain?
yeah, i have, but back to rock music...
no, the song! it's a really good song, it's a classic.
huh. don't think i've heard it.
i bet you have! the lyrics have a lot of pretty metaphors, it's a classic
i'll have to look it up
XXXXXXXXXXX
I got into an argument on Twitter last night with some jerk.
Was it one of those troll kind of people?
Yeah, I posted a pic of myself with a Nirvana tshirt on, and they tweeted Kurt Cobain was a loser who killed himself because his career was going downhill.
Uh, I bet you went off on them. Everybody knows you loved Kurt Cobain.
It really made me mad when I went to their page and saw they had fan stuff posted about Britney Spears and Selena Gomez. Kurt was a real musician with a great voice....
And Spears and Gomez are auto-tune ditzes.
Exactly. So I pointed out how Kurt was a great songwriter that wrote songs that really touched people, whereas those two haven
And Spears and Gomez have had their shares of mental problems....
I wasn't trying to put them down. I just said I refuse to argue with someone who listens to Britney Spears, and went to bed.
Good idea. Don't feed the trolls as I always say.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Aerosmith has to be one of the best rock bands of all times.
Yes, they are up there at least in the top five.
One of my favorites is Janie's Got A Gun.
What album is that from?
That was on the album Pump.
That one had a lot of good songs.
Love in an Elevator was on that too.
I loved that song.
So don't you think they are the best rock band.
Still have to say top five.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music?
I like alternative rock
Any favorite bands?
The Killers
Oh, that's a good choice. Do you have a favorite song of theirs?
I really like Mr. Brightside and then Sam's Town
Yeah, that was a good album
I also liked Just Another Girl
I don't recall that one
Definitely check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the song Black Hole Sun?
Yeah, by Sound Garden? I love that song.
That song always makes me think about the past.
Yeah, me too. Those guys must have done a lot of drugs to make a music video like that.
Yeah but its more than that. They are really creative too!
I agree. Its like some people just have the ability to come up with great songs.
Definitely. I wish I had musical talent like that.
Do you play any instruments?
Yeah I have played guitar for 7 years.
Well keep up with it, and some day you'll be really good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You can put a cd in the cd player while we're driving if you want.
What do you like to listen to?
I have mostly rock cds. There's some good driving music in there.
Oh boy, I see some- Beastie Boys!
That's really good driving music- like No Sleep Till Brooklyn.
First we gotta play Brass Monkey, I LOVE that song!
Everybody loves that song! That, and You Gotta Fight For Your Right To Party.
OH, and Girls- that song cracks me up.
I know, it's so sexist, but it's so funny I just giggle through the whole thing.
This is going to be a fun ride singing Beastie Boy songs!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey Fred, have you heard that new song by "Papa Roach"?
Which one?
The song is named "Help" it reminds me a lot of older "Papa Roach" songs
No kidding?  the last album wasn't that good
No this song is back to old school music like "Broken Home"
I guess i'll download it and check it out on Itunes
I don't think you will be dissapointed
I trust your judgement
Hey do you want to throw some hoops tomorrow?
Yeah absolutely
XXXXXXXXXXX
My favorite musician is gonna play here soon
Who
Dave grohl
He is pretty good
Yeah he is amazing
When is he playing
Downtown in two weeks i want to go
Cool can i go with
Sure thing we both can go
Awesome sauce
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite rock bands is The Scorpions.
Great band.
Crazy World was the best album they had.
When was that out?
That was 1990. The year I got married.
Wind of Change is on that, right?
Yes. The whole album was great.
It's funny calling them albums.
Rock You Like A Hurricane was another good one.
I forgot about that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you prefer the old ACDC songs?
Yes. Highway to Hell and TNT
What about Thunderstruck and Shoot to Thrill?
Those are great songs too.
I like all of their stuff.
I wish I could see them live.
Me too. They are a great rock band
Are there any better?
Maybe Black Sabbath and Metallica
I think all three are spectacular.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Chris Cornell from Soundgarden passed away?
Yes, that was a shame. It seems a lot of musicians have been passing away the past couple years.
I know, Prince was a big shocker for everyone when he passed. Which singer did you like better?
I"m a big Prince fan. I loved Purple Rain.
I like Soundgarden better. Did you ever get to see Prince in concert?
No, but I sure would have liked to.
I never saw Prince, but I saw Soundgarden several times.
How was their concerts?
Wonderful mosh pits, with all the people singing along to the songs.
You're lucky you got to see them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Metallica?
Yes
Are they your favorite rock band?
One of them.
Do you like all of their stuff?
No. Their early stuff is what I like.
Like Enter Sandman?
Yes.
Have you ever heard Unforgiven?
Yes. That is another classic and it's one of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like heavy metal or rock music?
Love rock and hate heavy metal.
What do you think of,the moody blues?
Great band,love nights in white satin!!
That's my favorite moody blues song.
Didn't they just get inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame?
Yes,I believe they did,not sure though.
They should be.
Should have been in a long time ago.
I definitely agree
XXXXXXXXXXX
What band have you been listening to recently?
I've been listening to The Pixies a lot.
They're great but I've only heard their last album. What was it called?
Their last album was called Trompe le Monde. It's a great album but it's probably not their best.
Well which of their albums do you think is their best?
That's a very difficult choice because all of their albums are fantastic. If I had to choose just one, I'd go with Surfer Rosa though.
Are there any songs on that album that I would know?
The song Where Is My Mind is probably the most popular from that album, it's been in movies and TV shows. It was in the movie Fight Club so a lot of people know that song.
Don't The Pixies have a female bass player?
Yes, her name is Kim Deal and she also sing harmonies with Frank Black in many of their songs. It's part of their signature sound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite Tool album?
I think I like Lateralus the best. What about you?
I really like Undertow and Lateralus. How long has Tool been around anyway?
I believe that Maynard founded in back in 1990.
Wow, I didn't realize that it had been that long.
I know. Did you know technically, their first album wasn't Undertow?
No, I didn't. What else could it be?
It was a demo they made called 72826.
Aren't demos usually just for the record company?
Usually, but the band was so pleased with it that they decided to sell it to fans.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you believe is the most influential rock band or musician?
Probably someone from the sixties, like Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.
No way, it has to be Chuck Berry.
What?  Blues isn't even rock.
Just listen to Johnny B. Goode, it's the quintessential rock and roll song.
There's not even heavy guitar or distortion, no way.  Led Zeppelin was doing that way better.
Maybe, but they did it way later.  You can't listen to something like Rock And Roll by Led Zeppelin and not hear Chuck Berry's influence.
So does the person who created the technique get the credit, or the person who refined it?
Well, that's a good question.  I'd argue the former.
I'd argue the latter.  Thankfully, we can rock out to both.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man this is so frustrating
What is frustrating?
I am trying to learn this song
What song
A rock song
Oh what one
Creeping death
Is it hard
Yeah it is pretty hard
I would bet
XXXXXXXXXXX
Absolutely loving the new EP from The Scandals, have you heard it?
No I haven't, I didn't even know they put out a new one.
Oh man you're going to love it, it's produced by Brian Fallon.
Wait, you mean the Brian Fallon, of The Gaslight Anthem?
You bet, his DNA is all over it, sounds like old Gaslight.
Oh my god I can't wait to hear this now.
Yep, Brian Fallon dipping his toes back into punk after Painkillers is a treat.
Though is it just going to make me miss Gaslight?
It might, but it might also make you feel okay that The Scandals can fill that void.
Very excited now, Jared Hart has a great voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you like?
I still like to listen to alternative rock.
Who is your favorite band?
I don't have a true favorite.  But my all time favorite song is Don't Speak by No Doubt.
I like that song, too.
Did you notice in the video that Pat Smear appears in a cameo?
Yes, in the black and white scene.
I really wish they did more as a group.  Now Gwen is pretty much on her own.
Her success has surpassed the rest of the group.
Yes, but they were still better as a band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the greatest rock and roll band of all time?
That is a tough question.
I think it's Led Zeppelin.
That's now a bad choice. What about Metallica?
I loved Metallica until they went crazy about the Napster thing.
Can you blame them for being mad at Napster?
Not really, but it's funny how all music is digital now.
Metallica was ahead of the curve on trying to get paid for digital music.
I still feel like 'Enter Sandman' is one of the greatest songs ever.
That is a great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whi is your favorite rock group?
CCR (Credence Clearwater Revival).
What is your favorite CCR song?
Lookin out my back door.
Do you have a second favorite.
Yes, I would say Bad Moon Arising
Who is your next favorite rock group?
Beatles
What is your favorite Beatles song?
Bridge Over Troubled Water.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Metallica has 3.4 million follwers on twitter
Wow thats a lot of followers
Amd they only like 37
Thats funny
They should like more than that
I abree they should support their fans
And make them feel important
Exactly
I wonder who the 37 people are
Me too
XXXXXXXXXXX
what do you think about the new bands out today?
some are ok but i like a lot of the more classic stuff.
like the stones? and the who?
yes they are okay but i always liked the edgier stuff like the ramones and the stooges.
so youre into classic punk rock?
sure and some other genres too but nothing beats the raw energy of the older stuff.
thats true a lot of the newer bands do all sound the same.
yes i agree, most rip off the older bands. todays seem so fake  like they try to hard.
yes i see alot of that but rock and roll is here to stay.
haha yes it is thank goodness. what would we do without it?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to the Alice Cooper Show.
Sometimes.
I really dig that guy.
He's pretty cool.
I swear, he knows everyone in music.
He is well connected.
I only ever like a few of his songs.
School's Out!
That was an epic song.
My anthem!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of a new rock band called CRX?
I have not. Where are they from?
They are from Los Angeles.
Cool! Is anyone famous in the band?
Yes. Nick Valensi from the Stokes is a member of CRX.
Good to know. How long have they been around?
They formed in 2013.
Is there a particular song you like? I want to look them up!
Check out the song "Broken Bones." It has an awesome guitar part.
Will do! Thanks for the tip.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Being a musician what rock era do you like the most?
Wow that's a hard one? If you want it from the adolescent me or the musician the answer may be different.
Tell me both. Adolescent first.
Growing up in the 90's I loved Kiss and glam rock. But Jimi Hendrix will always win out.
I can see that in you.
But as a musician I love metal and dissonance.
So who today is your favorite?
Steve Vai, Satriani and Jimi Hendrix. The best guitar players for my taste in music.
Yes those guys are all incredible
Don't get me wrong there are rock players like Carlos Santana and Clapton that are superb
XXXXXXXXXXX
Let's talk about rock music.
What about rock?
What artist is your favorite?
I like Jimmy Buffett.
What song by him?
Margaritaville.
Oh good choice!
I don't know much else by him to be honest.
But you just like that song?
Pretty much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music?
Not really.
Why is that?
I've always thought it was too aggressive for me.
Not all rock music is aggressive, though.
Like I said, that's just me. I've at least always had a soft spot for the instrumentals, though.
That's something. Is there any particular instrument that you like?
Probably the bass.
That's unusual.
Bass is so undervalued in music, and it's one of my favorite things about music in general.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could see one band in concert, who would it be? It can be now or the past.
Wow..That is a hard question to narrow down to one band.
What about a band still playing?
I would probably choose AC/DC because I had a chance to see them in concert, but something came up and I couldn't go.
I've heard they put on a great show live.
We ought to look up their schedule and plan a road trip. Who is the band you would like to see?
I always wanted to see Aerosmith. Tyler is a great showman.
I saw them years ago and they were incredible. I didn't want it to end.
I would love to take a month or so and see as many concerts as possible.
What a great idea. Let's start with AC/DC and Aerosmith and go from there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you consider "rock" music?
Well, for me, it's bands like AC/DC, Green Day, Nirvana
I would say that's more grunge
would you?  how do you define rock music?
i think it began in the 60s.  60s music up to that point was more bubblegum type music
what's bubblegum music?
it's the sweet, "how much is that doggie in the window" type stuff
I guess then that my favorite early rock and roll music would be Elvis Presley
He was basically one of the "fathers" of rock music
I guess that's probably true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock song
Cliche and famous or not
Both
Well then for famous i guess i would go with Anarchy in the UK
And what about non famous
Well that is harder
Well let me know
I do love Device Vilified
That is a good one
I know right
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music?
Yes I do, especially classic rock!
I am big on classic rock myself. I am a big fan of the Rolling Stones.
Hey they are awesome.  One of my all time favorite songs is "Brown Sugar"
Brown Sugar is a great dance song!  I also like "Satisfaction".
Yeah that's practically a rock anthem.
Yeah really! They played that multiple times when I saw them in concert and the crowd went nuts!
Wow what an experience!  Back in the day I went to lots of rock concerts.
Me too! One of my first concerts was the Doors, but the best rock concert I saw was the Beach Boys.
Yeah they can really rev up the crowd with "Good Vibrations!"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember that band Puddle of Mudd?
I think so. Name one of their songs.
One of my favorites was "She Hates Me."
I remember that one!
It was different but good.
I agree. The lyrics were pretty good.
I think I would have to say they were very good.
I must agree with you.
Did you like Creed?
Oh yes! They were popular when I was in middle school.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you listen to Kid Rock nowadays?
I think his time has passed
he really crossed genres
Yeah he started out in rap then went to rock now country.
Its crazy. I think Bawitdaba was a good song.
It was a toe tapper
But now the stuff he plays is way slower.
As he aged so did his music.
I remember the video was insane for that song.
Now he just talks about drinking beer and being old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think created the rock music genre?
Most people feel like that Elvis created rock. But, I don't.
Why not?
I think that he represents the person who made rock popular. But, he definitely didn't invent it.
Well, who did then?
That's difficult to say. It has many influences.
Like what?
It's a combination of Rhythm & Blues and Country.
I see, but what person most represents that culmination?
I would say it's Fats Domino. He's an amazing pioneer for rock music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite bands of all time used to be AFI.
A lot of people don't like them.
I think maybe because they changed in style but loved the evolution.
I agree they used to be just straight up punk.
What is your favorite album by them?
It is a tie between The Art of Drowning and Sing the Sorrow.
I can hear the song in my head that starts like your sins into me.
Oh my beautiful one, yes that is an awesome song.
I haven't listened to AFI in a while wonder how they evolved now.
Probably more emo and pop.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thrash metal album?
My all time favorite would have to be Rust in Peace.
Ah Megadeth at their peak, Friedman and Mustaine rock harmonies.
Friedman is such a great guitarist.
Oh absolutely, his stuff with Jason Becker was epic.
Such a shame what happened to Jason, he was a prodigy honestly
Agreed Cacophony was great and he and Friedman made magic.
Friedman is still going strong in Japan.
Yeah I've heard his solo stuff, mind blowing!
Absolutely a guitar god in my mind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the rock bands of the 90s.
Me too. Which one was your favorite?
I didn't have one particular favorite. They were all so good, you know?
Oh, I know. I especially liked the grunge era.
Same here! I couldn't get enough of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Alice in Chains.
Speaking of Soundgarden, did you hear that Chris Cornell passed away?
Yes, and I'm so sad about it. He was far too young.
Not as young as Kurt Cobain or Layne Staley when they died.
That's true. I guess the bright side is that their music will live on forever.
That's a good way of looking at it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band are you listening to nowadays?
I've been listening to Eagles of Death Metal a lot recently. They're a lot of fun.
Really? I heard they are great live.
They are, I saw them just last month on tour, but Josh Homme was not touring with them.
He's really busy with the new Queens of the Stone Age record. Do you like them too?
Yeah, they're fun and the steady rhythms are always catchy.
They're a call back to when rock stars were rock stars.
Definitely. Josh Homme has that old school swagger about him.
I know he met Jesse Hughes in high school, and they became friends years before starting a band together.
Really? I didn't know that. They seem so different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your all time favorite rock band?
Guns & Roses hands down.
How come?
They had the most influence on me growing up.
Oh yeah? How so?
I think them being a part of the Terminator 2 soundtrack really got me to pay attention to their music.
That's cool, so what would you say is you all time favorite song from them?
I'd have to say it's You Could Be Mine. I mean theres a ton of songs that I like from them but that one just has a special place.
How do you feel about their current music?
Honestly it's not as good as their stuff in the 80's but thats not to say they aren't good anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite AC/DC song?
Back in Black of course.
Love it. Dirty Deeds is my favorite.
I know. Tha's because your brother used to growl at the end.
I remember it like yesterday.
TNT was great too.
There are so many that could be my favorite song.
High Voltage was a great CD.
It was. A lot of people never even heard of it.
The great rock classics.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite rock band?
I think my favorite has always been the Eagles.
Yeah, I always liked them too.
I was so heartbroken when Glenn Frey died.
I know, I loved his voice. I really liked his song Boys of Summer.
Oh yeah, that was a great one.
It just want be the same without him in the group.
I know, but I heard they are recruiting his son Deacon Frey to sing in his place.
That would be awesome. I heard he sounds just like his dad.
He does, I've heard him sing. He is awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish rock was not so Emo now adays
How is it emo
So many people just being whiney
Because it is emotional
Yeah exactly why
Their is nothing wrong with that
But it is so kiddie
Nah and their is other types of rock dude
Show me some then
I guess i will
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know the band Foreigner?
Yes, I like them.
What's your favorite song by them?
"Cold as ice" is my favorite song by them.  The whole album was good.
What other song on that album do you like?
"Feels like the first time" is good and on that album.
What's your favorite Foreigner song not on that album?
"Say you will" was made in the 80's.  It's good too.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
Only once did I dee them in concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite Beatles album?
Wow, how do you choose?
You could make pretty much an argument for any album.
Yeah, their catalog is so huge.
So what would you choose?
Probably the White album.
I was thinking the same thing really.
You could make a great case for Sgt. Pepper though.  That was pretty influential.
When you're the Beatles, everything you do is influential.
Not sure they'll ever be matched.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like metallica
Yes, they are one of the few rock bands i like
You dont listen to a lot of rock?
No, do you like them?
Yes i love metallica
Oh okay
They are one of my favorite bands
Thats good
Yes i hope to go to a concert
That sounds cool
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the band Spoon?
I have! They sing "The Underdog" right?
They do! Britt Daniel wrote that song.
Is he the lead singer of the group?
He is! He is from Austin, Texas.
He is in some other bands too, correct?
Correct! He is also in a band called The Divine Fits.
What kind of music do they play?
They play Indie rock.
That is one of my favorite genres. I will definitely check that band out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Madonna?
She had some good songs in the 90s, like Ray of Light.
I actually saw her in concert in the late 90s.
I would have liked to see that. I wouldn't pay to see any concert of hers today, though.
Why not?
It's just not the same anymore. I think her glory days were the 80s and 90s.
Yeah, seeing Madonna perform now wouldn't be the same.
I have some of her CDs.
I actually have cassettes still going back to the mid-80s.
You're one of her old super-fans!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Little Fang is basically the Monster Mash of our generation
what is that?
a song! you haven't heard of it?
no, who's it by?
Avery Tare's Flasher Flicks
oh, sweet! i finally have something new for halloween parties
you're welcome. it's a cute song, honestly. way more catchy and danceable than monster mash
i'm excited to listen to it
they have a whole album, too!
awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any good punk bands?
Yes I do. Have you heard of Pennywise?
No I have not. What are they like?
They are big fans of the beach boys. They play punk that has a "surfing" edge to it.
That sounds awesome. They sound kind of familiar.
You might have heard them in some skateboarding videos.
So they are really into action sports?
Yes they are. Fans of those sports usually like their music.
If those daredevils are into it then I think it's worth checking out.
It is. You will definitely get pumped up by their songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Freddie Mercury of Queen had one amazing voice.
Oh yes he did.
He could hit such a range of notes. Bohemian Rhapsody was a great song.
It sure was and still is today.
I remember a duet that he did with David Bowie. It was the song Under Pressure.
Oh yea I have seen that!
That is one of my favorite duets.
It is a shame that he died.
It seems all the super talented ones have passed away early.
I know, such a waste of talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Bruce Springsteen will put out a new album?
I think he will but I'm sure he's enjoying just touring and relaxing.
True, I just love hearing new stuff from him and seeing where his head is at.
Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of High Hopes though.
Agreed, though that was more of a collection of covers and random songs.
Wrecking Ball on the other hand though, wow what an amazing record.
Wrecking Ball is one of his best outputs ever, which is awesome considering how late it came in his career.
Truly a masterpiece, especially after the weaker Working On A Dream.
Yeah Working On A Dream was pretty soft and weak.
But I think in contrast and in recession to Wrecking Ball, it's almost perfect.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into rock music at all?
Yeah every now and then.
What band do you like?
I like the band KISS.
Oh really? They are too heavy for me.
They are too much for many people, I get that.
Have you seen them in concert?
I did once.
Was it good?
It was fantastic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like lincoln park
Yes they are a great band
Where are they from?
California
I lile their first album
Which one is that
Hybrid theory
That one was good
I used to own it
I never did
XXXXXXXXXXX
Heard any decent new rock bands lately
Yeah I just got turned on to a new band called "Gold Class"
I've never heard of them‚ are they local?
No they are from Australia‚ a friend posted a video on Facebook
Oh cool‚ what kind of music is it
It's what I would call alternative rock
What's the name of a good song to listen to
"Twist In The Dark" is the one that got me into them
I'll give it a listen
You really should‚ I really like that song
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are you doing?
Talking to myself...
Is anybody listening?
I don't think so. I think I put myself to sleep.
Yeah, you are quite the conversationalist.
Uh-huh.
OK. Do you mind if I change the topic of conversation to rock music?
Fine. Just stay away from death musicians...they freak me out.
Ok. Did you hear that Ozzie Osbourne is making a come-back?
Why? Did he tire of needlepoint?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Queen touring with Adam Lambert?
I'm all for it honestly.
Really, I'm surprised I thought for sure you'd be against it.
You'd think that but there's nothing wrong with those guys getting out there with someone else.
So would you be against them putting out a record with Adam?
Now that I might be iffy on, especially dependent on how they label it.
You mean like what they did with Paul Rodgers?
Exactly what I mean, if they label on the box that it's with Adam Lambert then okay.
But isn't that a bit tacky?
There exists no other Queen besides the one with Freddy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who do you like better, Iron Maiden or Metallica?
That's easy. Iron Maiden!
What is it about their music that makes them superior to Metallica, for you?
Well, they're a lot more consistent and never watered down their sound for commercial appeal.
That's true! They don't really have a "Black Album" or a "Load" in their discography.
Yeah, Iron Maiden have set a high standard for themselves musically, and their music is creative too.
We tend to forget how influential they really were.
Yes, their dual-lead-guitar sound is pretty incredible, in how the guitars interlock and harmonize.
Metallica had some great albums and songs, for sure, but their music to me is not as intelligent.
Yeah, I think people who appreciate all sorts of music will get a lot more out of Iron Maiden than Metallica.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite 80s rock band?
Oh man, so many greats in the 80s.  I'll go with Guns n Roses.
I loved Patience.  I'll say mine is Motley Crue.
They were good, too.  Who can forget Dr Feelgood?
Do you remember KISS' makeup-less phase in the 80s?
The less said about that, the better.
Completely agree-- they had a really unique look and show, so they decided to look like every other band.
I really liked Poison, too.
Every rose does have a thorn.
I see what you did there.  Nicely done.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like rock?
Yeah sure love rock.
What kind of rock do you like the best?
I really like heavy metal a lot.
Oh really that is interesting.  I don't know much about that.
It really gets me going, you know, pumps me up.
It is some heavy stuff.
It's great for the gym.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you listen to rock music at all?
Yeah sure.
How often do you listen to it?
Probably once a day at least.
Oh cool.  Where do you normally listen to it?
Usually I'm in my car listening to it.
Like on your commute or something like that?
Yeah exactly.

Hurry up though
Dont rush me on this
Okay meanie
I got it
So tell me
Well i had to think cause that is a long list but i think the first would would be blue cheer
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever listen to REM?
I'm not a big fan, but I'll listen to them every now and then.
They really had a ton of hits back in the 90s.
Yeah, I really liked 90s type of rock, so I don't mind listening to them.  They have a lighter sound than today's music.
Yeah, I listen to music from that time more than I listen to stuff from today.
What's your favorite song by REM?
I don't know.  I really like Shiny Happy People for some reason.
Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that.
Why not?
It's just not as popular as Everybody Hurts or Man on the Moon or anything like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the band Kyuss?
I have never heard of them. What are they?
They are stoner rock.
What is stoner rock?
Stoner rock is a type of music that originated out west. It is music made by stoners.
That sounds far out. What are some good songs by them?
Check out Hurricane. You can find it on youtube.
Nice. When should I listen to this music?
I would listen to it while driving.
Awesome. Next time I go for a cruise I will put it on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you gone to any rock concerts?
Yes I've been to a few, like Journey and Black Sabbath.
How was Steve Perry singing live?
He sounded real good, just like the albums.
Because some bands sound awful when you see them live.
Yes but Journey was great.
What was your 1st rock concert?
It was Elton John, and then Van Halen. What about you?
My 1st concert was Quiet Riot and Twisted Sister.
That must have been good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any songs by Guns and Roses?
I used to love them back in the day. I love Axl Rose.
What's your favorite song by them?
Oh definitely November Rain. That buildup to the instrumental at the end and the end itself was flawless.
The video was really awesome too.
I can still see Slash standing in front of the church playing the guitar.
He was actually named at one point the greatest voice of all time.
Really? I don't know if I agree with that but he did have a phenomenal voice.
I wonder what he's doing today. I wonder if he's still rocking out somewhere.
I don't know but I'd love to see a Guns and Roses reunion show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just found my old Soundgarden CDs.
Oh wow. You still have those?
Yeah, I looked for them after Chris Cornell died. Were you into Soundgarden or Temple of the Dog?
I liked them both. I was more of a Nirvana and Pixies fan at the time.
Oh I love Nirvana. What's your favorite album.
Nevermind, of course! That album is a classic!
Yeah but some of the earlier stuff is good and In Utero was pretty good too.
Yeah. I was just reading a Spin article where Kurt Cobain was placed as one of the top 100 guitarists of all time.
Hm, yeah I'd say so. He didn't shred all that much but the songs were good.
Kim from Soundgarden was also on the list of top guitarists. I miss 90s rock!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the band nirvana?
Nope i think they are awful
What?!
What?
How are they awful
They sound horrible to me
I mean maybe overrated but not awful
I prefer alice in chains
You are so wrong
Nah not this time
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Foo Fighter's are going to have a new album out this fall?
No I didn't hear that, but hopefully that means they will go on tour?
Yes, and the album comes out Sept. 15. It's called Concrete and Gold.
Well, concrete is a rock, and so is gold, so maybe it's going to really ROCK.
Dave Grohl said it's going to be a GIGANTIC rock record.
They were playing Foo Fighters on the radio the other day, but it was one of their old songs.
Actually, Foo Fighters released a new song recently off the album called "Run."
I haven't heard that one.
They also played two new songs when they did a gig in Iceland recently.
We're going to have to get tickets when they go on tour.
XXXXXXXXXXX

When I Come Around
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what happened to Rock music?
I dont know?
I mean does it even still exist?
It does but on such a smaller scale I guess
I tuned in on the local rock music station and heard music from the 90's. I don't think  I heard anything new
Yea, I've heard
I know there are a lot of great rock bands out there, just not any big ones
Yea , I keep waiting for the next big thing to come out
I've been waiting for a while
We need a really great new rock act to come out
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to this band that keeps blowing my mind.
Who is it?
Tool. They are so great.
What kind of music is it?
It's rock music. They go into so many deep subjects.
Like what?
They go into deep mathematical, scientific, and philosophical topics.
That sounds like my kind of music. I have been studying that stuff recently.
Me too. Check this band out and you will love life more.
I will. Thank you so much for your suggestion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to Rock music?
Oh yeah I listen to Guns N Roses all of the time.
Me too, I just love their Appetite for Destruction
I love the song It's So Easy on that album.
Oh me too, I probably play that like ten times a day.
I do not blame you, it is catchy.
What else do you like?
Aerosmith.
I love Dream On from them.
Oh that is the best song they have.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, you listen to rock, still?
Yeah, 60's, 70's, and 80's. That was the high point in rock music.
Wow. It sounds like wailing and screaming to me. Who are some of your favorite bands?
Led Zeppelin, Rush, Van Halen, Areosmith, AC/DC...all the usual suspects.
Yeah, I like Aerosmith's song "Don't Wanna Miss a Thing." I'm kinds interested in getting into more rock music.
In my opinion, start off with the Rolling Stones, Credence Clearwater Revival...those 60's bands. If you go year by year, you hear a progression of sound.
What about the British Invasion?
Definitely go with The Who, Rolling Stones, even the Beatles. Read about some of their influences and you'll expand your horizons, musically.
Thanks. I'll check them out.
Good deal. The best thing to do is put in earbuds, lie back, close your eyes, and feel the music...something you can't do with most music today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of rock music did you listen to when a kid?
Strangely enough all the kids listened to Black Sabbath and stuff like that when I was a kid.
Oh you listened to metal music?
It was dark edge music like Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin.
Strange it was so popular.
In my neighborhood it was we also like Van Halen, Jimi Hendrix and stuff like that.
You listened to this all your childhood?
We also had a "Doors" phase where everyone listened to that.
You still like the hard rock music?
I still do but I listen to more of a variety of music today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of korn?
Yes they are a great band
I like them too
I like their song freak on a leash
Same here

Thats a good one too
Im going to google more of their songs
Same here
Okay
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was your favorite grunge band?
I would have to say Nirvana.
Not a bad choice, but I'm a Pearl Jam person myself.
Could never get into Pearl Jam, I mean they are okay, but I liked Nirvana's more agressive style.
You know it's funny I'm partial toward punk and Nirvana was certainly closer to punk than Pearl Jam, but Eddie Vedder seals it for me.
I can see it, guy was and continues to be a great songwriter.
He really is, sometimes don't feel he gets the credit he deserves in that regard.
I wouldn't go that far, he's extremely highly regarded as far as I can see.
I guess it depends on your definition of highly regarded.
I suppose so, but not sure how anyone could feel he deserves more recognition, he gets a pretty large amount as is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the song "I Remember You?"
Yeah, that was Skid Row, right?
Yeah, I was trying to remember who that was by.
I always liked that song.
Me too.  It was just basic.
Yeah, I know what you mean.  No frills.
I liked the sound of the guitar on it.
Yeah, it sounded nice.
What other songs did they have?
There was Youth Gone Wild, but I don't really remember many more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Rob Zombie?
Defintiely, he's a great heavy metal performer.
WHat are some of your favorite songs?
Well, one would have to be Superbeast.
Yeah, that's a good one. Did you know a version of that song is used in the soundtrack to the arcade game CarnEvil?
No, I did not. Another of my favorite Rob Zombie songs is Dragula.
The original or the Hot Rod Herman remix?
Either one, both are great.
What about LIving Dead Girl?
That one's okay, but I prefer Superbeast or Dragula, if given a choice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hello what are you listening to?
I am listening to Aerosmith.
Oh I love them, are they your favorite Rock band?
I like Aerosmith but I like Bon Jovi better.
Oh I do too! I love "Living on a prayer"
Yea it is my theme song of sorts.
I also like like Bon Jovi's "You give love a bad name"
Yea that one is ok, how about "Always"?
I like that one as well. It reminds me of Aerosmiths "Angel" since it is sappy.
Oh yes Angel by Aerosmith is so sweet! I listen to it when I am feeling bad about my relationship.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock bands do you listen to?
I like the classic rock, like Aerosmith and Van Halen.
I love Aerosmith, Steve Perry can sing.
Yes he can. What is your favorite song?
Theres alot of them, but I'll say Toys in the Attic.
I like the song Tell me what it takes.
What about Van Halen?
I like when David Lee Roth sang with the band better. How about you?
I like Sammy Hagar, but I think Roth is cuter.
I went to a couple Van Halen concerts in the 80's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of an album called "Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock" by The Who?
Yes, I've heard of it. It was not formally released.
Yet, it poses an interesting question. One that's still pertinent today.
I'm not sure I'm following you. What's the question, exactly?
Is rock music dead or alive?
It's alive!
Why do you think so?
I don't think you can kill anything these days.
What do you mean?
With all theses social media outlets, it's easy to bring people together on any topic. So, there will always be fans of rock music!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Muse play the other night, they were spectacular.
That's good, I can't seem to get into them though.
Really, what don't you like?
I don't know, something about his voice bugs me.
That's an odd complaint, his voice is generally very strong.
It isn't his ability so much as it is the way he uses it.
Explain what you mean.
He sings so dramatic sometimes that it can come off as cheesy.
Yeah but that's part of their charm, that operatic sound.
Yeah but if I wanted to listen to opera, I'd listen to opera.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What would you say is your favorite rock band?
I would have to go with Muse. You?
I would say Coldplay. The British know their stuff nowadays.
What's your favorite song from them?
It would have to be "Talk." What's your favorite from Muse?
I'd say that "Supermassive Black Hole" is their best song. It's funky and epic.
Ah. I love that one!
Did you ever go to a Coldplay concert?
No. I want to, but I never found the time.
That's a shame. They put on a good show!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Rolling Stones?
Very much.
They have some amazing classics.
Yes. They have so many good songs. I can't even name them all.
What is one that you like?
I really enjoy Start Me Up
I love Satisfaction
That is such a great song.
Mick Jagger had a great voice.
And Keith Richards was pretty amazing too at guitar.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a rock fan?
Yes. I like all kinds of rock.
Do you like punk rock?
Yes.
So you like Green Day?
They are good. I consider them rock and punk rock.
What about Good Charlotte?
Not so much.
They are good. You should give them a shot.
I will try. But, I think green day is the only good punk rock band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love rock music.
I do too. Pretty much all I listen to.
Me too. Who's your favorite rock group?
The e street band.
They're awesome.
Love the boss!
He's written some great music.
Yes,I really like born to run.
Wow,that's a classic for sure.
He's got a lot of classic albums.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Favorite rock musician?
Oh man! That's a tough one. There have been so many greats.
The way they keep dying. The choice will get easier and easier.
Just because they're dead, doesn't mean they weren't great: Elvis Presley and John Lennon are both dead. And they're still considered legends.
Legends is right. They're dead.
Okay fine. So who's your favorite living rock star?
I don't know. Is Alannis Morrisette considered a rock star? What about Lady Gaga?
Oh please don't tell me you listen to Gaga. Don't tell me you think she's a rock star?
Fine. So you tell me, who is a rock star? Miley Cyrus? What about Van Halen? What AC/DC?
AC/DC is rock. Van Halen... they used to know how. And Miley Cyrus is just an embarrassment.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any good new bands I should listen to?
I don't know how new they are but I've been listening to a band called Seapony lately.
I've never heard of them before. What kind of music do they play?
It's just indie rock. They have a female singer and they just have simple, nice and catchy songs.
Very cool, what are some bands that they sound like?
Maybe a cross between Cat Power and The Lemonheads.
Sounds interesting. What's the name of a recent album of theirs and what's a good song on that album?
The most recent album is called A Vision. There's a lot of good songs on that album but if I had to pick one I'd say that the song Let Go in really good.
I will see if I can find that song. Maybe I'll download it to my phone and give it a listen while I'm driving home later.
If you want I can send you a YouTube link to some songs so that you can preview them and see if it's something you'd like.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see that Queen is going out on tour?
That's so strange given that half the band isn't with them.
Yeah, but at least you get to hear them playing the classics.
True, and Adam Lambert's voice works well with rock.
I'm hoping to get tickets.
Do you have a favorite Queen LP?
Queen II, definitely. It's their mangum opus in my opinion.
I'm more into the radio singles and stuff.
Those are also good, but they used to be so much more intense.
It was the 1970s. Everybody was intense.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw a cute story online about Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters.
I love Foo Fighters. What happened?
Apparently he has an 8 year old daughter who takes after him and wanted to learn to play the drums.
Not surprising. I think kids inherit things like musical ability.
He was playing a gig in Iceland and called her onstage to play the drums for a song.
That is funny! What did she play?
She played drums for the song "We Will Rock You" while the rest of the band played along.
Oh how cute. Was she any good?
Apparently so. The crowd supposedly loved her.
Maybe she'll join the band when she gets bigger like Eddie Van Halen's son joined Van Halen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What defines a rock and roll band?
I guess it's just a matter of opinion. Modern, classic, new age?
Right, there are so many catagories.
I love classic rock. We just seen an Aerosmith concert on tv last night.
Oh wow, how did they sound?
Pretty good. Very entertaining.
They have so many good songs.
Yes they do. Steven Tyler swore so much, I was shocked.
Not that it bothers me but I agree sometimes language in rock music can get back.
It's just not nessesary. Classic rock didn't have so much vulgar words.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Alice Cooper is coming out with a new album next month?
I haven't heard that.
It's called Paranormal.
That's a good name for the kind of music he does.
I heard the new single and it sounded pretty good.
What's it called?
Paranoiac Personality.
Is it out on YouTube?
That's where I heard it.
I've got to go listen to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock band?
I really like southern rock, like Lynyrd Sknyrd.
Skynyrd is a most awesome group.  What is your favorite song by them?
Most people like "Sweet Home Alabama", but I like "Freebird" the best.
Oh I love that song.  Freebird always makes me want to slow dance.
Listening to Freebird makes me want to wave my lighter in the air.
What album is Freebird on?
I know it is on Gold and Platinum.  That album has all their greatest hits.
Is it one CD or two?  Do you know?
Its a double CD set.  I have pretty much worn mine out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man tell me the loudest show you ever saw?
That would have to be Soundgarden
What venue? How long ago?
This was the Fox Theater, in Oakland CA, February 2012
Just how loud was it?
Man they played a bunch of hits and album cuts too. Mostly male audience but no drama in the crowd
What made this so loud?
I don't know but the final song was "Fourth of July" and it was so loud and heavy it shook my jawbones
Is that the concert shirt?
Yep: as the shirt says, it really was "Louder than F***"
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever listen to The Offspring?
I haven't in a while, but they are awesome!
Yeah, I like to listen to them when I'm stressed.
I can understand that.  I've played their stuff while I'm driving and screaming at the top of my lungs.
Yeah, it just helps you get the energy out.
They've been around forever, huh?
They've been around for a while.  I remember playing one of their cassettes in the nineties.
What tape was that?
I don't remember the name, but the case had a picture of a little boy swinging.
Oh, I think I know the one you mean!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you like?  I like rock.
I like rock too.  I love the classic rock the best though.
Like Guns N Roses and Poison?
Yeah.  Their music was so intense and they always put on a good show.
The old school bands were great but I like a lot of new stuff too?
Like What?
I love Kid Rock!  I'm always singing along to his songs.
I love his "All Summer Long"  It reminds me of my teenage years growing up on the lake.
I really like Bush too.
They're pretty good.  I love "Glycerine"
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to Om?
No, who is Om?
They are a very cool rock band.
How would you describe them?
They are very spiritual. Every listen is a spiritual experience.
That sounds great. Where should I start?
I would listen to the album Conference Of The Birds.
I will. What is the best song on there?
Flight Of The Eagle is my favorite.
Nice. I will check that out today!
XXXXXXXXXXX
The new Cheap Trick album came out this week.
Oh wow did it really?
Yeah it's not their greatest but it's good to see them still making music.
I was just going to say that even if it's not that great, the old guys still putting out tunes is a relief.
Definitely, it's a pretty heavy record too, they're still experimenting with new sounds.
Oh wow see I would have thought they'd be kind of resting on their laurels a bit.
Nah, not at all, they really bring some heat even if the songs aren't much to my liking.
I wonder if they'll tour to support the album.
They probably will but everytime an old band tours to support a new album it's boring.
You're right, they always end up just playing the hits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm bored of all of the music on my computer. What should I listen to?
Have you ever heard of Royal Blood?
No! What kind of music do they play?
They are a rock band from England. They are very cool.
Are there a lot of people in the band?
No. There are actually only 2 members.
Wow. But they still have a big sound?
Absolutely. They totally rock and play garage rock that is loud and awesome.
What song should I listen to first?
Try "Little Monster". It is one of my favorites
XXXXXXXXXXX
How much do you like the Grateful Dead?
I'm not a big fan.
No,I'm not either.
They had a lot of big rock albums though.
Yes they did.
I did like one song. A touch of grey.
That was a pretty good tune.
Other than that,not a big fan.
They had a rediculous following.
For sure. Didn't get the whole thing though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was a better rock band, the Beatles or the Stones?
Hmmm, well i prefer the Beatles but they were a bit more poppy. If you're talking straight up rock, maybe the Stones
Yeah, i see what you mean. I like the Beatles better too overall.
Who are some of your other favorite rockers?
David Bowie would definitely be at the top of my list
Yeah, Totally. He was a legend.
Yeah, speaking of legends, i'd have to say Neil Young falls into that category.
For sure! How about Bob Dylan, he was folksy but can also rock out
Yeah, definitely legend material
Right on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Aerosmith?
Yes I used to.
Try listening to their music again, it is really good.
What songs do you prefer of theirs?
I like sweet emotion and come together.
Those are the jams, I forgot about those.
Yes you want to listen to them now.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
Dont mention it, I love the band.
Ok great, thanks again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to learn to play something
Play like what
Play an instrument
Why
Because i want to learn it would be cool
Do you got a silly idea
Well it would be cool to start a rock band and make rock music
Sounds interesting
You mean sounds promising
We can go with that if you want
XXXXXXXXXXX
What style of rock are you into?
Classic rock and new age rock
Over the span you have loved rock for so long, who is your favorite band?
Linken park
Do you play rock music yourself?
Yes, i played electic guitar for about two years.
How do you support your bands?
T-shirts, and live concerts.
Have you turned from any bands? as in left or didn't wanna listen to them anymore?
Yes, a few and out grew a few. Ac/Dc and gun's and roses, i wanted to find more indepth, none radio rock. To really drive my music crave for rock.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Chris Cornell passed?
Who?
The lead singer from Sound Garden.
That's so sad.
It gets worse.
Don't tell me.
He hung himself.
What?!
After a concert.
Your right, way worse.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you think Nickelback is so hated?
I think people think their music sounds all the same.
I kind of like them. I think all bands face that to some degree.
I think it became cool to hate Nickelback.
So people hate Nickelback because people hate Nickelback?
Pretty much, it hasn't stopped them from being popular, though.
I agree, I think everyone secretly knows all the words to Rock Star.
That song is probably the epitome of why they are hated, it's about selling out.
I always liked their first album.
Some of the songs are dumb, though, like Photograph. "how did our eyes get so red and what the hell is on Joey's head? "
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's the king of rock and roll?
Elvis,of course.
Man I wish I,saw him rock in his heydays!!
Would have killed to see him.
He opened the door for rock music and rock bands.
Absolutely correct about that.
Too bad he died so young.
Yes it is but his music lives on forever.
I play his stuff a lot!
He's on all of my playlists
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, what kind of sub-genres of rock music do you like?
Well, I personally listen to mostly indie rock. I'm not too fond of mainstream bands.
Dude, you sound like such a hipster! What about Aerosmith, and AC/DC?
I appreciate them for what they've done for the genre as a whole, but they're not really my cup of tea.
That's blasphemy man! How can you not like classic bands like that?
Well, I feel like their stuff is too played out. The lyrics and songwriting just don't vibe well with me.
So, you're into softer, more mellow stuff? In my opinion, you're either headbanging, or you're doing it wrong.
That's like, your opinion man. I'm entitled to like whatever bands I want to like.
You have a point there man, but at least give me some recommendations for indie rock bands.
Check out Fleet Foxes dude, their album Helplessness Blues is one of my all-time favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to come over tonight? We could watch a dvd and order a pizza.
What movie do you want to watch?
I rented a couple movies this morning. I have one called The Runaways. It has Kristen Stewart in it, and it's about the 70s girl rock band.
Oh yeah, I like that movie. I always liked Joan Jett, she had a really powerful voice. I used to have that album with the song Cherry Bomb.
They were one of the beginning girl bands that really rocked. I like the movie because it tells what life was really like for them.
It must have been hard being girls and being rockers back in the 70s when it was mostly guys.
Yeah, life was a lot different back then, especially for women.
She's still making music, she put out  a song in 2013 she wrote with Dave Grohl from Nirvana and Foo FIghters.
That's kind of weird to think of isn't it? A 70s rocker and a Nirvana band member writing together in 2013.
It just goes to show how they are both still such good musicians.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm not sure why I always see people complain about Weezer's new stuff.
Same, I think they've been a really consistent band.
A lot of people seem to want them to just put out samey stuff unforutnately.
Which is a shame because they have evolved in so many ways and they're always interesting.
Agreed, Rivers Cuomo is very good as exploring new sounds.
Some people feel though that if you're in one genre you have to stay there.
I can definitely see why some people might not like Thank God For Girls.
Yeah it has a modern pop sound that Weezer isn't typically known for.
But that's also what makes it so good right?
I agree and I am always looking forward to what they put out next.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Linkin Park?
Of course I have.
I have seen them live
They put on such a good show
In the End is still a great track even after almost 20 years.
They know how to write good music.
Do they still perform
They did a mashup with Jay Z
Did that give them new life?
No I think it just crossed genres for them
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rock band?
I grew up in the 80s so I like a lot of rock bands from the 80s.
Oh, what is your favorite band from back then.
I think I like Bon Jovi the best.
Do you have any favorite song?
I know it is the most popular but I liked Livin' on a Prayer.
Do you like anything else.
I like a bunch of them like You Give Love a Bad Name, Bad Medicine, Runaway,
I wish I could go see them play.
Not sure if they play any more but I saw a cover band a couple years ago which was fun.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever hear about the rock band KISS?
Heard of them? My uncle is a huge fan, he never shuts up about them.
That's funny, does he have any cool memorabilia?
Well, he actually owns a life-size cardboard cutout of the band, it's quite a spectacle to see.
Hahahaha! Your uncle seems like my type of guy, what do you think about KISS though?
I like them too, but I'm not a die-hard fan like my uncle is. He told our family to bury him in a KISS coffin if he ever passes.
Tell your uncle I want to be buried right next to him! KISS army for life man!
He'll definitely find that funny. So, what are you doing later today man?
Nothing today, I'm just going to stay at home and listen to some music, as usual.
Alright man, well, if you ever want to meet my uncle, I'll let you know when he comes over.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I LIKED ELVIS AND ALL OF HIS MUSIC
JAILHOUSE ROCK WAS THE FIRST VIDEO
I ALSO LIKED LITTLE RICHARD
HE WAS THE BEST LOOKING MAN IN SHOW BUSINESS
MY FRIEND AND I USED TO BLAST "LUCILLE". IT WAS THE BORING NEIGHBOR'S NAME
EVERYTHING WAS SO UPTIGHT IN THE FIFTIES - MUSIC WAS A GREAT ESCAPE
CHUCK BERRY LASTED A LONG TIME
I WOULD LIKE TO GO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM IN WASHINGTON TO SEE HIS RED CONVERTIBLE
HIS SONGS LIKE MAYBELINE WILL LAST A LONG TIME
DON"T FORGET JOHNNY BE GOOD
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think rock music is dying?
What do you mean?
You don't see any big rock acts anymore.
There are still big rock acts touring.
Yeah, but they are all bands from the 70s and 80s.
I guess that's true.
I can't even name you a big rock group from this decade.
I don't think I can either.
So do you think rock music is dying now?
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Bon Jovi?
I really liked their stuff from the 80s through the 90s?
Did you like It's My Life?
The song itself wasn't bad for the time it was released, but I really didn't like the album.
Did you like any of their music after that?
Not really.  They were so good in the eighties, but that was a different time.
I understand what you mean.  It was like two different genres.
Exactly.
What was your favorite song by them?
There are so many of them.   I really like Blaze of Glory and Dead or Alive though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am very happy that blink-182 is still around.
Yeah same, Matt Skiba has done a great job filling in for Tom DeLonge.
The deluxe edition of California was even better than California itself.
Agreed, the collection of songs on there were really strong.
Especially so, and when stacked up against the original CD it's one of their best albums.
I completely agree with you, the deluxe edition tracks have a harder edge.
Yeah they contrast really well with the brighter songs on the original release.
Do you think we'll get another album with Skiba?
They've found themselves in immense success with him, I can't imagine they wouldn't.
I'm really curious to see what Tom puts out with Angels and Airwaves as a response to blink's newfound success.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your all time favorite rock band?
I would say The Who
What was you favorite song by them?
Has to be Baba O'Riley
I think that song spans generations
OH it is definitely a huge track
I have heard many bands cover it
The music is used in commercials all the time
I wish they made new music
Guys get older though so it sounds bad
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard that Journey is on tour again.
Wow, I'd really like to see them live.  I had tickets to see them a couple years back, but they cancelled.
Yeah, one of their shows would be awesome.
They have so many good songs.  It would be amazing.
What's your favorite Journey song?
Maybe Lights or Separate Ways.
You don't like Don't Stop Believin?
It's okay.  Just over the years, I've heard it so many times.
Oh, it's just kind of stale.
You could say that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Euronymous
I think so
You know he was a rock musician from norway
Yeah what happened to him
His friend killed him sadly
Such a shame i heard he was a good musician
Oh he was pretty good
What kind of music was his rock
It was sort of atmospheric and heavy
Sounds delightful
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of rock music do you like to listen to?
Lately, I've been listening to a lot of old stuff like The Cure. I also have always listened to AFI, if you've heard of them.
Yeah, I remember AFI from the early two-thousands. They've changed so much since then, I can't really bring myself to listen to them.
I actually like their new sound. I guess that's just to be expected when you've made music for decades though.
Yeah, I guess that is right. It would be hard to think up so many songs in one sub-group that long.
I've come to love their newer stuff. I started listening to them when Miss Murder debuted and then just started listening to all of their stuff.
I first heard of them way before that, probably when the Sing The Sorrow Album came out.
Well, that wasn't too long before, but I went back and listened to that album too after falling in love with their December Underground album.
The only song I liked on that album was actually Kill Caustic. It sort of reminded me of their old sound.
Yeah, that is one song which stands out in the album against the others.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is/was your favorite rock artist?
I never liked rock a bunch, but I did enjoy listening Bob Dylan.
What did you like about Bob Dylan?
I liked his substance and his delivery.
What is your favorite song from him?
Like a rolling stone
That song was great and that songs is pretty old.
Yes, it is a song from the 1960s.
Who else do you like in rock?
Metallica is great as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It is. What's your favorite Nirvana song?
It's hard to pick a favorite but probably Lithium.
Thats one of my favorites too. My all time favorite is Smells Like Teen Spirit.
I was lucky enough to see them in concert. Pretty awesome.
Lucky you.
I have the very first album ever released, Bleach.
Cool. When was it released?
Late 80's. You know they were inducted into the rock n roll hall of fame?
I didn't know that. What year?
2014
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite decade for rock music?
I think it would be the 70s.
You don't mean disco, do you?
No, I mean guitar bands.
I like that too. What is one of the bands?
I think Cheap Trick was great.
I don't remember them. What did they sing?
Do you remember the song I want you to want me?
Oh yeah. That is really catchy.
That's one of my favorite rock songs of all time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, let's talk some more rock music trivia.
Oh, you never get tired of this, do you?
No, I just find there's so many neat little factoids out there, it's fun to talk about.
Okay, what do you got?
Well, you know the song "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynard Skynard?
Of course, everyone knows that one!
Well, there's a part in the beginning where the guy says, "Turn it up!"
Okay, yeah, I remember that.
Well, that's actually the singer talking to the sound engineer to turn up the music, but they thought it sounded so cool they actually left it in the song.
Really?  That's pretty neat.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Pearl Jam is such a timeless band
Yeah I think they still tour too!
Yellow Ledbetter is their greatest song.
I think you cant even interpret the lyrics
Yeah thats why I love it
Because its so open?
Yes thats the reason
I love Jeremy
Its a rock classic
I think so too
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whatever happened to rock music? Sometimes I think U2 is the only rock band left.
That's crazy--there's plenty of great rock music still being made. It's just that no one's famous anymore.
Well, that's the thing. I used to hear about the White Stripes, but now I can't think of anyone--Cold Play's not a rock band.
Yes, I know what you mean--it's like the celebrity world only has room for a few pop stars. I miss the guitars
I guess there's still Radiohead, but I haven't liked much of what they've done since OK Computer.
I liked a few songs on Kid A, but you're right--it wasn't the same after that.
Maybe we're just getting old?
No, that can't be it! Besides, I think there are some young bands we just haven't found yet.
I have a friend who's really into Queens of the Stone Age.
They're okay, but believe it or not, they've been around for 20 years now! Yes, we are getting old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite 70's rock artist
I am a big fan of KISS
Wow, they really are popular
Yeah, their song I was made for loving you is one of my top songs of all time
why is that
because the energy used in that song is out of this world
I cant disagree. Who is your favorite KISS member
I like Gene Simmons
Cool, I've seen documentaries on him. He looks like a cool guy in real life
Yeah I've met him before and he was really nice
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to listen to rock music?
Yes! My favorite band is U2.
Oh yeah? What is your favorite album by them?
I really love The Joshua Tree. Did you know that they have a tour for the 30th anniversary?
No, I didn't know that! I personally liked Achtung Baby.
Me too, that's a good album. What other rock bands do you like?
I really like classic rock - The Rolling Stones, The Who, Pink Floyd, and so on.
Those are all good choices. Mick Jagger is one of my heroes.
Yeah, I really like that era of music.
They just don't make them like that anymore!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What type of music are you listening to these days?
I'm actually a pretty big fan of Halestorm. They're my favorite rock band right now.
They have a female singer, don't they?
Yes, and she's insanely good. She's also their rhythm guitarist.
I didn't know that. That's pretty cool.
What're you listening to these days?
I found myself looking back at Metallica's 90s stuff recently.
'Nothing wrong there. The black album s a classic.
It is, absolutely. I also feel like Load and Reload are very underrated.
The public didn't take too kindly to those if I remember right.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love good old-fashioned rock music.
What do you mean?
The stuff from the 50s and early 60s, before the Beatles.
I didn't know there were any any rock bands before the Beatles.
Not just bands! Great solo acts like Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochrane!
Never heard of them.
Of course you haven't. The Beatles pretty much blew those guys off the map.
What about Elvis?
Elvis was around.
I like Elvis.
XXXXXXXXXXX
whos your favorite rock band?
the rolling stones
cop out answer! you just answered one of the most famous rock bands, come on. think harder.
they're good!
they're basically pop and they're ancient. try again.
what about the beatles?
you're hopeless. try again! something modern
hawthorne heights, then
...what? they're still a band? okay, you're hopeless. have fun with your bad music.
harsh!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are your thoughts on Counting Crows?
Counting Crows?  Man, that takes me back.
Are they even making music anymore?
Beats me.  I don't think I can really remember any songs from them in the past 15 years.
Did you know the lead singer once dated Jennifer Aniston?
Seriously?  That dude had dreads even.
I know, crazy right?  If I were dating her, I wouldn't stop dating her.
Well, when you're popular like they were, you were actually more well-known then her too.
I'll have to see if they have anything recent.
Yeah, give it a spin and let me know.
XXXXXXXXXXX
They're having a sale at the record store downtown, do you want to go with me after we get off work?
Sure, I could use some new cds to listen to in the car. What's the sale prices?
It said 30% off of select artist cds and albums, and there were some cool rock band cds in the ad.
That sounds good, what kind of bands were they?
They had Imagine Dragons, Breaking Benjamin, U2, and Red Hot Chili Peppers in the ad.
OH, I really like Imagine Dragons. I was listening to a song on the radio the other day, Demons, and I loved the way they sang that song.
I listen to the radio in the car sometimes, but I got a new car cd player for Christmas, so now I've been listening to a lot of cds while I drive.
What cds have you been listening to?
A lot of old rock bands. I was jamming to AC/DC on the way to work this morning, singing yeah you, shook me all night long.
That's hilarious. We'll have to play it on the way to the record store when we get off work.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I feel like going for a run, do you suggest a play list?
I dont have a playlist but I would suggest rock music for a run
Oh good idea, have any good songs?
oh yes, how about "running with the devil", "runnin down a dream", "eye of the tiger"
those are great, especially eye of the tiger, then I can feel like Rocky running down the street with the kids
I love that movie, do you listen to rock often?
I love it when I run, and when I sing in the shower
In the shower?
it makes me get motivated for my day
I could see that working, I will have to try that
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite band?
Boston is my all time favorite band.
What's your favorite Boston song?
"More than a feeling" is my favorite song from them.
What do you like about that song?
It's so upbeat that even if I'm in a bad mood it will lift my spirits.
Do you have a second favorite song by them?
Yes, "Don't Look back" is my second favorite Boston song.
Have you ever been to one of their concerts?
Yes, several decades ago I ent to see them in concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know of any good rock bands?
What genre are you looking for?
I want some bands from the 90's.
I found this cool band called Nirvana.
They sound cool. Who are they?
They are fronted by the late Kurt Cobain.
Kurt Cobain sounds cool. What happened?
He was depressed and killed himself.
That is too bad. What is a good song?
I would check out Smells Like Teen Spirit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Iron Maiden?
I love that band. They have some excellent guitar riffs.
Run To The Hills & The Trooper are two of my favorite guitar parts in their songs.
They have fans from all over the world. I am always amazed at how popular they are.
It's true. The band has been around since the 1970s and they are still just as popular as ever.
How many original band members are left at this point?
I think there is only one.
What is his name?
Steve Harris is the only one who has been in the band since the start.
Wow! He has been playing Iron Maiden songs for a long time at this point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you into Red Hot Chili Peppers?
Yes, still am.
Yeah, they're pretty great. Some good songs.
My favorite is still Californication
Really, that seems like some of their overrated work.
No way, I have some good memories with that one.
I have to go with Give it Away Now
Yeah, everyone likes that one.
They've been around since 1983.
Man, that's crazy. Durable band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which era is your favorite for rock music?
I love rock music from the 90's! That era epitomized rock music.
I actually agree with you. I really resonate with certain rock groups from the 90's.
Which ones are your favorites?
My two favorite groups are the Stone Temple Pilots and Depeche Mode.
Great choices! I think both of those groups produced some great rock music.
I jammed out to quite a few of their songs.
I did too. "Big Bang Baby" by the Stone Temple Pilots was my jam.
That is too funny. I can just imagine you jamming around to that song in your room on full blast.
If you think that is funny you should have seen my hair styles that I had during that time!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Jamming out to Nirvana?
Yes Kurt Cobain's voice is so unique.
Yes I can feel his emotion.
His voice does communicate so much.
Yes he is truly a special person.
Yes I like him a lot.
Yes I do too.
I am going to watch his live stuff soon.
Yes I like seeing him live.
Yes I think live is the best for a great artist like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you listen to?
I love rock. Classical is okay, but I don't like country or rap.
I like rock too. I was a big fan of alternative rock in the 90s.
So I bet you liked Nirvana then.
Oh, I LOVED Nirvana. I liked Hole too, with his wife Courtney Love.
That's surprising. I know a lot of fans blamed her for his death.
I try to separate the art from the artist. Especially with bands.
That's probably a good idea, since a lot of rock stars are troubled people.
I wonder if being a troubled person caused the great music, or being a rock star caused the troubled person.
That's a really interesting question. Probably both.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what did you think of Alice Cooper?
He was a wild one, wasn't he?
Yes he did some raunchy stuff.
But he was a good singer.
What was your favorite song?
School's Out for Summer. That one is still popular.
Mine was Eighteen.  He did some crazy concerts.
Yes he was a toss between punk and metal.
Yeah that sounds about right.
I think he is from Detroit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's your favorite rock band?
ACDC of course
Why?
Cuz I love that song Back in Black!
OOO what about Dude looks like a lady
Isn't that Bon Jovi?
Is that the guy who does, It's my life?
Heck yeah! I love that song
Wanna head bang to some Thunderstruck?
LET'S DO IT!!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Long live rock! Who did that?
Right,The Who,lol!
Good one,but I really meant it. Love rock music!
Same here dude!
Unfortunately nothing new coming down the pike I like.
Yea,it's all techno garbage.
Right,give me old time rock n roll!
Bob segar!!
Hahahahah,your nuts but right again.
Nothing like a good rock concert brother
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rock music artist?
I'd have to say the Scorpions is my all time favorite.
What is your favorite Scorpions song?
I especially like "There's No One Like You".
Is there any other songs by them that you really like?
Yes, I really like "Rock You Like A Hurricane" too.
What is your second favorite rock group?
Van Halen is also among my favorites.
Which Van Halen song is your favorite?
I don't have just one Van Halen favorite but I like "Jump" "Hot For Teacher" and "How Do I Kow That It's Love".
XXXXXXXXXXX
Would you listen to Nirvana still?
You mean if they were around.
Yeah thats what I mean
I would not I was not in love with them
Smells like Teen Spirit was such a great anthem
It was but they didnt do anything specifically great.
I think they could write better than most artist.
You could say that but their songs sounded too under produced
Thats the sound they were going for.
I think they would want something a little more polished off than that
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock and roll music?
Yes, I do.  I like older music better than some of the new stuff.
What is your favorite group or band?
It would be hard to pick just one but I like AC DC.
What is your favorite AC DC song?
My faovrite song by AC DC is "For those about to rock".
Have you ever been to an AC DC concert?
I've only been to one AC DC concert and that was about 25 years ago.
What's another band or group that you're really fond of?
I like Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Grunge Rock is Classic Rock?
What do you mean?
Well, I remember when Grunge Rock became popular. And, it was presented as being Alternative.
Alternative to what?
It was supposed to be an Alternative to Classic Rock.
Yes, I understand. So, it's not Classic Rock?
We were told that when Grunge was first popuar.
Then, what happened?
I'm not sure. But, now, I've noticed that Classic Rock stations play Grunge Rock.
Then, I guess you just answered your own question. Grunge Rock is now Classic Rock!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So who's your favorite rock star?
Well, I don't know if you'd call him a "rock star" the way you'd say that about Bowie or something, but Roger Waters for sure.
From Pink Floyd?
Yeah, especially late Pink Floyd. I prefer the Waters-driven melancholic wartorn era of that band.
Like what album? I'm only familiar with Dark Side Of The Moon.
Yeah that was an earlier one, David Gilmour had alot of input on that one. But The Wall for instance was mostly all Waters.
I saw that movie once, couldn't make heads or tails of it.
It's a concept album about war, and about Waters himself and how he felt like fame had turned him into a pseudo-fascist.
Whoa, I thought the Wall was just a metaphor for closing ourselves off from others
Yeah it was about that too, but that film and album had a definite defiant mean streak to it as well. Top notch rock in my opinion.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Kaleo live the other day and they were amazing.
Oh is that the rock band from Iceland?
Yup, you probably heard their single Way Down on TV.
Yeah I remember hearing it in an episode of Lucifer, how was it live?
That song was great but their whole set was spectacular.
Oh wow that's great to hear.
They played Thursday night at Firefly Music Festival and they were the best set of the day.
I can imagine hearing their blues-rock style live in a festival setting would be cool.
Oh it was, their solos and riffs were giving off great vibes.
If they come around locally I'd be down to check them out with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of The Killers' new stuff?
You mean their new single The Man?
Yeah precisely that one.
It's a bit different, more of a disco vibe than a synth rock vibe but I dig it.
I like it too, I was expecting a backlash against it but it's been pretty positive.
Yeah the YouTube comments are generally pretty positive.
Now that could just be because after five years we finally got a new Killers song.
Could be, but nothing stops YouTube commenters from being terrible if that's what they want to do.
Very true, I'm glad to see the reception the song is getting.
Same, I can't wait for the full album in September.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Hoobastank was a good band
I remember Crawling in the Dark but not much else.
They had the song The Reason as well.
Oh yeah I forgot about that.
I guess thats not a good sign
I mean they had a good 5 year run in them
They still make new music every year
But nothing that has broken though
Yeah nothing huge like those 2 songs
They were aided with interesting music videos which no one makes anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to rock music?
Yes, i listen to all kinds of rock
What is your favorite type of rock?
I love 80's rock music like the gogo's, duran duran, the culture club and much more
What was your top 5 bands or artists of the 80'srock?
Duran duran, gogo's, pat benatar, billy idol, prince
Where did you listen to the rock music?
I mostly watched Mtv
Did you buy rock albums?
Yes, my 1st rock album i bought was the KISS 1st album
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do they call it rock
Well it is not simply called rock

Well that sorta makes sense
Well yeah it does
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some of your favorite rock bands?
One of my favorite is Aerosmith.
What are some of their best songs?
I love dream on, walk this way, Janie's got a gun, etc
Aerosmith has been around forever.
I know, but not as long as the Rolling Stones

Hey, do you know what band I've really gotten into lately?
Which band?
My Bloody Valentine
Oh. I have heard of them but have always been deterred by the name
I totally get that, but forget the name and listen. You will not regret it.
What is their sound?
Well, they basically pioneered "shoegaze"
Oh, okay.
I don't usually like extra harsh sounding guitars, but their way of doing it along with Bilinda Butcher's soothing vocals make it all so beautiful
Man, I guess I better go check them out like right now
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am feeling wacky today.
Do you want to hear some wacky music?
Absolutely. What do you have for me?
Check out the band Primus.
Primus. What a weird and wacky name!
That is the point! You need to listen to them.
What is a good album by them?
Frizzle Fry is great. Check it out.
That name is so cool! I want to hear them now!
Do it. Buy the album or find somewhere online and listen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How do you feel about classic rock?
I love classic rock. My favorite band from that era is probably Fleetwood Mac.
Isn't Stevie Nicks the greatest?
Yes she is and her voice is amazing. She's a real witch you know?
Really? I always thought she had that witchy vibe about her.
She came out in an episode of American Horror Show: Coven
I would have loved to see that. My favorite Fleetwood Mac song is Silver Spring.
Oh you could really feel her pain towards the end of that song.
It's like she was fighting with demons. You could tell she'd been through a lot.
Yes, she is and always will be one of the greatest female rockers ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I saw Imagine Dragons in concert yesterday.
How was that?
It was awesome.  They played tons of new songs from their album that will be coming out.
They have a new album soon?
Yep, I think it gets released this Friday.
Oh nice.  You'll have to let me borrow it.
Some of their new songs have been on the radio.
Yeah, I've heard that Believer song way too much.
True, but a couple of new ones will start to go into rotation.
I'll have to be on the lookout for them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Weezer?
Oh yeah!  Every once in a while I definately like to listen to them.
What do you think your favorite song was when they were just beginning?
I'd have to say Say it Ain't So.  That song is awesome!
I agree.  I like that one and Undone.
My Name is Jonas was good too.
Do you like any of their later stuff?
Yeah, they've always been pretty consistent.  Their album from the mid-2000s was pretty good.
The Make Believe album?
I think that was it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Sammy Hagar song?
I have too many to pick just one.
I know, me too.
Well if you had to, which one would you pick?
Three Lock Box.
Not many people know that song.
I know, but true Hagar fans do.
Yes, the ones that listen to entire CD's.
You got it.
He is still rockin.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Give me your top three favorite bands mate in the rock genre.
Do you mean just rock in general or do you mean classic rock, like Led Zepplin rock.
I guess either one, now that you said Led Zepplin.
Okay, well then I would say Pink Floyd.
Wow. Really? Why would you choose them?
First off, the variety of music they play is pretty stellar.
How would you describe the sub genres of music they play?
I would say between psychedelic rock, to pop rock, to gospel rock, if that's even a sub genre.
Are you referring to the backup singers in the album Darkside of the Moon?
Well, yes, I had that in mind for sure. I think they used the power of backup singers very well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are you doing this summer?
I'm going to see Poison at DTE music theater.
Wow, sounds fun!  So you're really into that 80's rock then?
Yeah, big time.  Those bands always put on a great show.
What did you think about the '90s alternative grunge rock?
It was okay, it didn't grab me like the '80s hair bands did though.
It was a shift away from that pop-metal or melodic hard rock, I will have to admit.
Yes it was; it was sort of depressing by comparison.
Yeah, some people have said that.
I don't mean any disrespect though, those band undoubtedly had skills and whatnot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Metallica is a classic band
Yes people are going to listen to them for generations to come
Thats when you know you are good
When people listen to you after youre gone?
Exactly
I agree with that
I definitely think metallica will be like that
I think youre right
They are really good
They are
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock band?
My favorite modern rock band has to be Coldplay but as for the classics it would have to be the beatles.
I love those bands, especially cloldplay's Viva La Vida and the Beatles Yesterday.
Some of my favorite songs as well, and I am certainly enjoying a lot of coldplay's current stuff.
There recent song "fly on" really grabbed me.
Oh, I love that whole album (the "O" album).
I think they have become much more experimental with rock and pop.
I agree, the entire ghost stories album is different from their more classic music (in a good way).
My favorite track from that album was definitely magic.
Did you know that it was nominated for a Grammy for best pop album and won billboards award for best rock album/ Definitely illustrates the point.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What bands have you been into recently?
Not too much new but I've been really getting into older Alice In Chains stuff.
Yes, I haven't listened to them in a while but they were really good. It's too bad about their singer dying.
Yeah, Layne Staley had an amazing voice. Jerry Cantrell is still keeping them going and they got a new singer who also sounds really good.
I wish I could have seen them in concert back when they were in their prime.
Definitely so. They are still touring but it's not the same as seeing them back when they were at their best.
Out of all the bands that came out of Seattle, Alice In Chains was probably the best.
That's a matter of opinion. There were a lot of good bands from that city in the day but yeah, they're up there for sure.
What's your favorite Alice In Chains song?
That's tough to say but right now I have been listen to the song Would a lot so I'd say that one. Ask me again in a week and I'll probably have a different favorite.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to KISS?
Not much, they were kind of strange.
They dressed weird, but they had some great songs.
Who was the one with the long tongue?
That was Gene Simmons, he is a pretty cool guy. I seen him on some reality show awhile back.
What were some of their songs, maybe I'll recognize one.
Rock n Roll All Night and Party Everyday, and Beth
They both sound familiar, name another one.
Love Gun. They made more money on their costume and get ups than anything.
That's what I heard but they made bucks!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Heard any good rock music lately?
Not really any new stuff. I mainly listen to my old Metallica tapes.
I love Metallica. The Black album was my favorite.
I can listen to that for days. It takes me back to a better time in my life.
Rock music can do that. It can bring up so many memories.
I've actually seen them in concert a few times and they were fantastic.
I've always wanted to see them live but never had the opportunity.
They're actually still touring. They did a bunch of shows last year.
I had the opportunity to see them and Guns N' Roses together about twenty years ago but couldn't make it.
That would have been incredible. Those are my two favorite rock bands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to a new rock music station. They play all of the greats.
Like who?
They play Def Leppard, Lover Boy, Foreigner, and ZZ Top among others.
I love Def Leppard!  I don't hear enough of them on the radio these days.
I know!  My favorite song of their's is Rock of Ages.
Mine is Too Late.  Do you like Bon Jovi?
I do!  I love Wanted Dead or Alive!
Oh me too!  I especially love Livin' on a Prayer!
Definitely!  That song is like the story of my life!
Mine too!  They really scored when they wrote it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a fan of Quiet Riot?
They were okay.
Just okay. Their album Metal Health was great.
It did have a lot of good songs.
They were the first metal rock band to have a top five hit.
Were they?
Yes, in the early eightees.
Didn't know that.
One of the best rock bands of that generation.
I guess they don't get the recognition they deserve.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you listen to a lot of rock?
Yeah sure do.
How do you listen to it?
Usually on the radio.
I stream most of my stuff these days.
Yeah that is a good option, I'm just on the road a lot.
Do you listen to XM at all?
No I don't have that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are songs by Simon & Garkfunkel rock music?
No, they are folk music!
The duo are in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame! What's the difference between rock music and folk music?
It's a small, but significant, difference.
Tell me what it is.
Okay, it has to do with perspective.
What is perspective?
The perspective of rock music is to create energy.
What's the perspective of folk music?
It's to tell a story or to make a difference.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey have you ever hear of Hoodie Gurus?
No who are they?
Early 80's Australian rock band.
How would I have heard of them?
I don't know. They got a good bit of play where I'm from. Leilani, My Girl, Bittersweet.
Wait, that kind of sounds familiar.
You know them...they kind of peaked mid late 80's. I couldn't get enough.
Didn't they stop playing for a while then get back together.
Yeah, I'm not sure if I've heard any of the new stuff. I like the old stuff.
I'm going to have to check it out and see. It sounds so familiar. Nice throw back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you listen to metal?
Yeah, a fair bit. Why?
I'm looking to get into it, but I don't know where to start. There are so many genres!
Well, you could always start with the big four of thrash. They were my gateway into metal.
The Big Four?
Yeah, Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer. My personal favorite is Megadeth, but many people like Metallica. They're kind of like beginner's metal.
Yeah, don't they get played on classic rock radio nowadays?
Yeah they do, but I'd recommend their albums from the '80s. They were pretty heavy and technical back then.
Ok, I'll check them out. What else do you like?
Lately, I've been listening to a lot of progressive metal, like Symphony X and Dream Theater.
XXXXXXXXXXX
death cab for cutie...thoughts?
so good! i like their older music more

XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear who's being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year?
No, who?
ELO, Joan Baez, Journey, Tupac Shakur, Yes, Nile Rodgers, and Pearl Jam.
Wow, that's a really wide variety of bands. The oldies, YES, to alternative superstars Pearl Jam, to rapper Tupac.
I'm glad Pearl Jam is being inducted, they have always been one of my favorite alternative rock bands.
People say Eddie Vedder is a nice guy too.
He has a really unique voice. I was lucky enough to see the band at an outside concert once, and his voice just floats through the air.
Where was the concert at?
Wisconsin. I drove past all these green lush fields, lots of cows, and then there was tents everywhere with concert goers and it looked like Woodstock or something.
Pearl Jam should have sang the song lyrics differently, instead of Yellow Ledbetter, they should have sung Yellow Ledbutter.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to anything good lately?
Actually I've been listening to some older stuff.
Oh really?  What have you been listening to?
Stuff from the 70s and 80s.  I've really been into Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
Tom Petty had some really good music.  He had a really distinctive voice.
Yeah, he music is just classic.  I think it's better now that it was then.
Yeah, it was different then, but it seems so right now.
I guess that sounds right.  What are your favorite songs by them?
I really like Don't Come Around Here No More.
Oh, I remember that music video.  It was so weird!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of U2?
I like them.  They have been able to reinvent themselves and stay popular.
Have you seen them in concert?
Yes, I saw the Joshua Tree Anniversary Tour.  It was awesome!
Who is your favorite member of U2?
I know Bono gets lots of attention for his charity work, but the band would not be U2 without The Edge's guitar mastery!
What is your favorite song of theirs? I love One and Bad.
I love Beautiful Day, Pride, and Where the Streets have No Name.  I think All you Can't Leave Behind is their best album.
What other concerts gave you been to?  I would like to see Coldplay.
I think Coldplay is overrated!  I love  Mumford & Sons.  I have seen them twice.  I saw Fleetwood Mac two years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What your favorite rock group man?
I'm going to go with a band I grew up with Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Nice. Yeah they are a pretty solid band. I like Flea's bass style.
Yeah, and Anthony's vocals are pretty dynamic. He can rap and sing.
Yeah. Ever since the first album, which was more like punk rock, he has shown his ability for words.
Well he definitely had some stuff to write songs about when it came to drugs and relationships.
What do you mean?
Well look at the song Under the Bridge. If you listen what do you think that describes?
Okay. I got you. Where are they from?
I think they are from Seattle around the time of grunge.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Metallica?
You know, I'm not a huge fan, but we say our son's "song" is one of theirs.
In what way?
Well, when my son was born, their song "The Unforgiven" was playing on the radio.
Oh wow that's awesome. That's a good song.
Yeah it's probably my favorite Metallica song. It's very cool.
Definitely. Do you like any other Metallica songs?
Sure, I mean I like their hits OK. I like "Enter Sandman."
I think everyone likes that song!
Yeah really. It's a rocking song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you listen to a lot of rock music?
I usually listen to it when I am in the car.
Have you found any modern bands that you like?
I like a couple, but I mainly like the older stuff.
Who is one of the new bands you like?
I like Coheed and Cambria.
I like them, but I know what you mean about the old stuff being better.
I just feel like no one has really lived up to what those bands did.
I know, KISS and Metallica will always be the golden age to me.
I agree. They just don't play like them anymore.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man
Hello
What is good
Just chilling listening to some music
Cool what you listening to
I am listening to some classic slayer
That stuff is tight

Some of the best rock music out their
Easily
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock band? Mine is Nine Inch Nails.
I like them too. My favorite song is "Bite the Hand that Feeds" hands down!
I used to be the biggest Korn fan ever. I jammed "Coming Undone" relentlessly.
I never get tired of listening to Nirvana. Kurt Cobain was a legend who will forever be missed.
Yeah, that is true. I loved how David Grohl transitioned to the band Foo Fighters.
Totally! My jam is The Pretender. I also like "The Best of You.
What about the group Disturbed? They have some pretty awesome hits.
I used to have the album 10,000 Fists. I never knew what happened to it.
I like their remake of Land of Confusion and the music video was really good.
You should check you their
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to The Grateful Dead?
I haven't but my mom was a fan so I know a few songs when they're played.
I can show you some of their music if you want--my favorite album is American Beauty.
Is that the one with the rose on the cover?
Yeah, that one and Workingman's Dead are great albums. Absolute classics.
What songs do you recommend?
Ripple from American Beauty is wonderful.
Wasn't there just a new documentary about them put out?
Yeah, it's on Amazon Video.
We should watch it sometime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think was the best era for rock music?
I'm going to say the mid 60s to the late 70s.  So many good bands at that time.
Yeah, Rolling Stones, Beatles, Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac...
I love Fleetwood Mac!
What's your favorite song by them?
Silver Springs I think, even though I love so much of their stuff, so it's hard to pick one.  You?
I really like Songbird, and Never Going Back.
Some deep tracks there.  Favorite album?
Easily Rumors.
I would love to see them in concert.  Do they still tour? I've got the biggest crush on Stevie Nicks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, how do you feel about the '60s psychedelic rock scene?
Well, I like it a lot, really.
I know some people would say it hasn't held up too well.
That it's super dated? Yeah, but that's part of the appeal for me.
Sure, I mean, I don't need my music to be timeless.
Looking at music as a historical document is much more interesting for me.
Yeah, and '60s psychedelic rock shows a lot of what changes were happening with the postwar generation.
And honestly, if you look past some of the dated production and stuff, I think its messages are pretty timeless.
Yeah, the idealism and optimism!
Exactly, and we need a lot of that today, if you ask me.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know New Order
Yeah, I love that band!
How about Joy Division?
"Love Will Tear Us Apart," right?
Yeah, but that is kind of the thing--I tended to just listen to their first few very will known tracks.
But they have a surprisingly deep discography
Yeah, for onky being an entity for a few years, well with Ian Curtis. But, yeah, I spent all weekend listening to their other songs, and they are fantastic!
Yeah, it's too sad that Ian died
Yeah, but it is also awe-inspiring the effect he created in the music world. I mean, I know he was only a portion of the band, but as the lead singer he obviousky becomes the main i
Yeah, one of those once-in-a-generation types
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to meet my idol one day
Who is your Idol
Chris adler he is a drum machine
Oh yeah he is a beast on the drums
For sure he is a maniac
One of the better ones of modern music
Drums are no easy feat
Yeah they are exhausting
and demanding
Well are they not the same thing
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite old rock band?
How old?
The 80's or earlier.
Hmm, probably Metallica.
Wow, really? They are a little hard for me.
Yeah. My dad listened to them a lot, so it is kind of nostalgic.
I see. Mine is probably ACDC.
Oh, I like them too!
My favorite song is probably Thunderstruck. What is yours?
I really like Back in Black.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Radiohead?
I have seen videos for some of the songs.
Oh, what videos?
I just watched Man of War about an hour ago.
Well, was it any good?
The song and the video were really cool.
I think their sound is a lot more mellow than it used to be.
Yeah, there is a kind of dreamy ambience of you compare Daydreaming to Paranoid Android.
At least no one is saying Muse sounds like them anymore.
No, now Muse sounds like Queen!
XXXXXXXXXXX
There sure were a lot of great bands in the seventies.
There sure were. That was my favorite decade of music.
Mine too. Queen, Yes, David Bowie were all hitting the scene and people are still listening to them today.
That is why they are the classics. Neil Young was one of my favorites.
He is great. There are so many great bands from that era.
Yes, how about the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin. I never saw Led Zeppelin, but I did see the Allman Brothers.
Wow. I never saw them. I did see David Bowie and Elton John. Now they both could put on quite a show.
Their music is amazing.
They truly are a couple of the greatest songwriters of our generation.
Yes, but it is a shame that Bowie passed away so young. He had so much talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the first rock concert you went to?
Wow, so long ago. I have to think.
Mine was a music fest concert.
What like an all day thing?
Well, a half day concert. All great bands.
Who was it?
Journey, John Cougar, Brian Adams, The Tubes and Sammy Hagar.
All five. You were lucky, that's a great line up.
Steve Perry can really belt out the music. Brian Adams sang Cut's Like A Knife.
Wish I could've seen all them bands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been listening to Led Zeppelin all week, such great stuff!
Yep, absolutely and it seems to never get old!  What songs have you been rocking out to?
Trampled Under Foot and In My Time Of Dying, both off the Physical Graffiti album.
I love that album!  Down By The Seaside reminds me of spending time with my family in Scotland.
Jimmy Page's guitar work is incredible.  He can be hard and rock out yet softly strum in the same song!
That makes me think of his work on The Rain Song.
What a beautiful song, have you ever seen the video that goes with it?
Yes, Robert Plant is riding a horse and he's like a hero going to rescue the damsel in distress.
That is from the Song Remains The Same video, isn't it?
Yes, part of that video is a concert and part of it is an acting/story dramatic thing, must be one of the first music videos ever!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Frankie Valli?
Yes. His love songs are good.
Do you like My Eyes Adored You?
Yes. That is my favorite.
It is a powerful love song.

Suzie Q
How many of their records do you have?

Any other Rock group you enjoy?
The Beatles
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Killers?
I like a lot of their songs.
Have your heard their new song, The Man.
Yes, I just listened to it today.
What did you think.
It was okay. I am not sure that I liked it as much as their last album.
I feel the same way, but it was a good teaser for their upcoming albu.
What is that going to be called?
Wonderful, Wonderful.
I might check it out, when it is released.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the best rock band ever?
I'd have to go with Whitesnake?
I love their song "Here I go AGain".
that one is good, but I like "Is this Love"
What is the name of the guy that started the band
David Coverdale when he left Deep Purple.
They are from England right? What year did they start?
Yes England, and I believe 1978.
What year did they do that reunion thing?
1994, and then officially reformed in 2002.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite thing about rock music?
For me, it's always been the guitar.
Do you play?
Yes. I've been playing guitar for a few years now, and mostly play rock.
That's great. Do you have any influences?
Well, I really don't make my own stuff yet.
Oh. Do you at least have any favorites?
If I had to pick some, it would be Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix.
Excellent choices. Hendrix especially.
I know. He's a legend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am a big fan of Tom Petty.
Me too. His lyrics are great.
Sure are! I love his new cd Hypnotic Eye.
Yea that has a lot of good songs on it.
Full Moon Fever is my all time favorite.
Yea, I love American Girl.
Years ago I called Ticketmaster for Tickets to Tom Petty. When I got them they were for Tom Jones!
Oh that is horrible.
I was really mad. I have seen him several times since then.
I have never seen him in concert.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You know who's early music is frequently being overlooked by radio stations?
No, who are you talking about? American or British, or what?
I'm talking about David Bowie...He was British.
Oh, sure. "Space Oddity", I know it.
Well, that's what I mean. Most people know that one, from his earliest American release.
Well, what else is there? "Changes" is another that I recall.
Yep, that's another that gets played a lot. But my favorites hardly ever get played, like ones off the album, "The Man Who sold The World".
Didn't Kurt Cobain do a cover of that? Wasn't it with Nirvana?
Yes, but my favorite is called "The Supermen". It's about a society of supermen that are so desperate to die that they battle each other in games every year, on purpose.
Didn't he also write a tune about a computer who wanted to destroy the word in "Savior Machine"? I love that one too, and wish they would play it on the radio more often!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about music
I love music
What do you listen to
I love rock music
Me too
Who is your favorite
Definitely metallica
They are really good
I love the sandman song
One pf my favorites
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any rock bands like Foghat or Led Zepplin?
I love that song Slow Ride, and Stairway to Heaven.
Me too, I never got to see them in concert though.
Me neither, but listening to Foghat blasting on the stereo was cool.
We would go to the river and blast Led Zepplin too.
Did you like Bad Company?
Yes and their song Bad Company was the best.
I used to listen to Three Dog Night because my brother played it every morning.
Jerimiah was a Bullfrog was my favorite.
Yeah I should know that song by heart, we listened to it so much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of rock music?
I really love it, I just wish more people I knew were into it.
What bands do you like listening to?
I really like the rock music of the early 80s. Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, there were a lot of good British bands.
Yeah, shame Def Leppard got lumped into the hair metal genre.
Not really, hair metal was fun to listen to. They dressed weird, of course, but they had some pretty heavy rock music.
I honestly did like Motley Crue, they were a guilty pleasure.
Girls, Girls, Girls was great, but power ballads like Home Sweet Home and Without You really hit close to home.
Power Ballads, yeah, you hear of Tesla, they had a good one.
Love Song? Indeed, I really liked that one!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you have a favorite rock band?
I don't know, I don't listen to too much rock.
If you had to pick one what band would it be?
My parents listened to a lot of The Rolling Stones.
So the Rolling Stones then?
Yeah I guess so.
That is a great pick.
Thanks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Crazy Train is Ozzy Osbournes best song. Don't you think?
Without a doubt.
That song has been used in so many different ways.
It has.
It's been in movies, ssports arenas and still played on the radio.
Do you have any of his CD's?
I have Blizzard of Oz.
I don't. Thats a good album I have Diary of A Madman.
Back then we couldn't afford to buy them all.
I know, but know we culd just listen on Youtube.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ozzy sure hasn't aged well.
When you live that hard....
He can hardly talk anymore.
Yeah, kinda sad.
I loved Black Sabbath.
One of my favorites too.
No reunion tour for them.
It'd be pretty awful if they tried!
Sharron could make it happen.
Ha! I'll be she could!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Nickelback?
I liked This is How you Remind me.
I think the track was a rock anthem
They still play it at sporting events.
People say how bad that band is.
Yeah but people were buying their records.
Do they still make music?
I think they just tour in Canada alot.
Thats interesting because they were on top of the rock world.
Yeah but people ripped them in the States for some reason
XXXXXXXXXXX
So I'm thinking about buying tickets to Blink 182 tomorrow.
Are they in town?
Yeah.  Tickets haven't really been in demand though.
They're kind of a bit of date.  Doesn't seem like people like them as much.
Well, one of their singers left and it just hasn't been the same.
Yeah, the guy moved to Angels and Airwaves.
Tickets are relatively cheap though.  Want to go?
Yeah, pick me up a ticket.
Cool.  Make sure you wear your 90's clothing.
Still do!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm in the mood for some rock music, any suggestions?
You should check out a band called Morphine.
Oh really? What is good about them?
For one things, they have no guitars, only a bass player, a saxophone players and a drummer. They have a really unique rock jazz sound to them.
Sounds interesting, are they new?
No they were mostly around in the 90's.
Why aren't they around anymore?
Sadly, their singer and main songwriter, Mark Sandman died.
That's too bad. Was it from a drug overdose?
No, he actually had a heart attack right after a concert in Italy. He had a heart condition.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who's your favorite rock band?
Tom Petty and the Heart Breakers.
Excellent choice!
You?
Lynard Skynard, for sure.
They were pretty great.
They had a cover band come through just a while back.
I heard.
Did you go!
No. I wouldn't have liked it, I sure.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of classic rock?
I think so. The late 60s through the 80s is the best part of that subgenre.
You wouldn't go before that?
The 50s were too poppish. All of the good bands emerged during Vietnam.
Which one is your favorite?
I'd have to go with Jimi Hendrix.
I'm more of a Rolling Stones fan.
"Sympathy for the Devil," right?
That is their magnum opus.
I agree, but I'm partial to "All Along The Watchtower."
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best rock song ever recorded?
Stairway to Heaven
That might be true. But, are there any other possible ones?
Free Bird
Is that Lynyrd Skynyrd?
Yes
It's a matter of interpretation. But, those songs are great.
There are so many to name.
Don't forget about Hey Jude
True. That is a great song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
To bad about chuck berry dying.
Yea,another rock artist gone.
Yea,he was a true rock legend!
Boy was he a pioneer or what.
That he was.
How about that song my ding a ling!!
Hahahahah,crazy stuff but a big hit.
I know,out of the norm but it worked.
It did work.
He was talented but troubled
XXXXXXXXXXX
DO you like dressing like a rocker or a punker?
A mix of both but more towards a rocker.
Have you ever been mashing before?
Yea! all the time, greatiest experience ever.
Have you ever been hurt during a mash pit?
Been pushed on the floor, and swung into someone but nothing serious.
Do you follow any rock bands on social media?
Yes, such bands like pantera, and korn. I hade a conversation with them a few times.
So, do you want to be a rocker some day?
Oh certainly, who doesn't, i can rock on everyday and play live everyday. Famous i will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you want to go out Saturday night and hang out in a club or something?
Sure, have you been to that bar on Central Ave called Mickey's? They play really great rock songs, and have several pool tables.
I've drove past it, but I haven't been in there. What kind of music do they play?
I was there a couple weeks ago, and they were playing Metallica, Coldplay, Van Halen, 3 Doors Down, a whole mix of cool rock.
That sounds really good, I love Metallica but I don't hear it too often any more.
I miss 90s rock, it was the best. They used to play Metallica on the radio every day, now they never play it.
Most clubs these days play electronic dance or rap, and I wind up with a headache.
I know what you mean. That stuff gives me a headache too.
It's funny how you can listen to a band like Metallica really loud though and it doesn't give you a headache.
Right?! We should go hang out there this weekend then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Blink 182?
Yeah they are from the 90's. They are okay.
I don't like their drummer. But, they have a couple good songs.
90's rock is the best.
Nirvana, Pearl Jam and The Smashing Pumpkins were all awesome
If you had to pick one, which would you go with?
The Smashing Pumpkins
They have some great songs
I also like No Doubt
Gwen Stefani is awesome
XXXXXXXXXXX
hey, I'm so old I remember the advent of punk music in America.
No kidding. that is old! Did you listen to Sid Vicious and stuff?
I didn't know.  There was one kid in my school who was into the Clash, and everyone was confused.
I could imagine.  Most people were into metal in those days.
Yes, I liked all the "hair bands" back then.  i was a big fan of Def Leppard.
I loved Motley Crue and Ratt, especially "Round and round."
I remember David Lee roth in the "jump" video.  He literally jumped around.
That was when MTV was music TV.  Wow, you are old.
That is true.  But these days, I still like old classics like Zeppelin and Twisted Sister.
Well, i'm going to go listen to some Metallica;s "enter sandman" now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is rock music of interest to you?
Yes I listen to Onion the Hunter.
I never heard of them.
Take a listen to So you Ran.
Okay sounds cool. What else?
Do you like White Zombie?
Oh yes, them I do like.
What song?
I like Grease Paint and Monkey Brains.
Oh awesome, I will have to listen to that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you you like the red hot chile peppers
Yes
I used to listen to them all the time
Me too
I liked californication
That was a good song
Their songs are so catchy
I really liked all of their songs
Me too
They are a great band
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder who invented rock
Was it elvis who invented it
i can for sure say it was not him
Is he not called the king though
Well that does noot mean he is the original
Why could it not
Because i am certain it was made by a African american
Are you sure
Yeah i am completely sure
Well maybe i will look it up
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the rock band AFI?
I think I have heard of them. What does that stand for?
It stands for A Fire Inside.
Oh yeah, is the singer of the band named Davey?
Yep, Davey Havok. Well, he started a side band too called Dreamcar!
I heard of them! It's with the musicians of No Doubt.
Exact
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love rock and roll music!
No duh! Every shirt you own was from a rock concert!
Yeah baby!
I don't know if I should ask this, considering your recent interest in Boyz II Men, but tell me, what is your all-time favorite band?
Oooooh...tough one. I don't think I can answer that question.
Ok then. So, what are some of your favorite rock bands?
Genesis, with Phil Collins...One of the few drummers that can carry a tune.
Nice.
Kansas, with Kerry Livgren...and Styxx, perhaps my all-time favorite!
Very good!  You have restored my confidence in your judgement.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of Queens Of The Stone Age?
I have not. What kind of music do they play?
They play rock and alternative music.
Where are they from?
The band is from Palm Desert, California.
That sounds like an interesting place.
The lead singer is incredible and talented too.
What is his name?
The lead singer's name is Josh Homme.
Awesome! I'll check them out today. I'm excited to hear his voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what's your best rock band?
System of a down
How long have you listened to them?
Since my teen years
Have you gone to any concerts?
yea, a few, and i saw a group of rock bands and had a fun time hanging with friends.
Do they sound better today, or better years ago when they first started?
Today, they influense a more younger crowd and it's just totally hip supporting these bands.
Any other rock bands you have interest into?
Hatebreed, slipknot, no doubt. It's totally rock having all these bands there. Rock on, sniffle, sniffle,sniffle
XXXXXXXXXXX
Think the Beatles are a pop or rock band?
Definitely rock!
I agree with that.
A lot of people don't.
Yea,I know people like that.
Listen to helter skelter and you tell me that's not rock.
Man you're right there.
That song rocks!
Big time rocks.
Big time rock.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Bad Religion?
No, what are they?
They are a band that has been around for decades.
What kind of music is it?
They play punk rock but evolved over the years.
Awesome. Where do I start?
I would listen to 80-85.
Nice. What exactly is that?
It's a compilation of songs they made from 1980 to 1985.
Cool. I will check this out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about rock music
That sounds good
Who do you listen to?
I like lincoln park
I love them
They have a great sound
I love their lyrics
And their vocals are good too
Definitely
They are a great band
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear Chris Cornell died?
Oh no really?
Yeah, apparently he performed a concert in Detroit and then was found dead in his hotel room.
That's a shame.  I loved both Soundgarden and Audioslave.
What were your favorite songs?
I loved Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden and I have to say I Am The Highway was my favorite Audioslave song.
Like a Stone was probably my favorite Audioslave song.
He basically helped pioneer the whole grunge rock thing in the 90s I feel like.
Definitely.  Him and Nirvana and Pearl Jam.
Those were some great days for rock music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know that Tool is releasing a new album?
Are you serious? No, I had no idea.
Yeah, apparently its coming out soon and they're also going to tour again.
Wow. I'd pretty much given up on Manyard ever doing anything with Tool again.
I know, when he started yet another side band, I figured Tool was done.
At least all of his side bands are really good.
True. I really do like A Perfect Circle and Puscifer.
I went and saw Puscifer last year.
How were they?
Incredible, but unfortunately, Manyard made use all promise not to talk about it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How was Limp Bizkit so popular?
They played a genre of music that people loved.
Rock has always been around though.
I agree but they put a twist on it.
They also started out covering Faith by George Michael.
That was a great track
Yeah and they really made it theirs.
I liked their cover of Behind Blue Eyes
I think you might be the only one
Well it was a good rock cover of a pop song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock
Yes i love metallica
They are an awesome band
What songs do you like
I love the sandman song
Thats one of my favorites
What song do you like
I like that one song
Thats a good one too
They both are
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have a particular favorite rock band?
I have been a huge Avenged Sevenfold fan these last number of years.
I hear that. They are a great band and I've been listening to them for a long time, as well.
Do you have a favorite album of theirs?
I feel their self-title from around 2008 was very well done and had some great songs.
That was a good one. Nightmare, which I think was their next album, was also great.
Nightmare was an amazing album, too. I loved the song "So Far Away."
Did you know that song was completely dedicated to The Rev?
I have heard that, yes. Very sad he passed away so young.
Definitely but I think he would've wanted the boys in the band to continue on.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to rock music ever?
Yes I have been listening to Point Blank.
Oh I love that band!
What song do you like?
I like the song Nicole.
That is a catchy song.
It always gets me in a certain mood.
I know what you mean.
I want more music from them soon.
I could not agree more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the better Van Halen singer?
There was what, three of them?
I think so.
I would go with David Lee Roth.  Can't beat the original.
Sammy Hagar was no slouch though.  They arguably had better commercial success with him.
They sold some records no doubt, but Roth will always be the king.
It's funny that no one can even remember Gary Cherone was the singer once.
That album was junk though.
I don't even think I kept it after I bought it.
I don't really consider it a Van Halen album to be honest.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like rock?
Yeah I love rock.
Oh good same here.
Nice.  What kind of rock do you like?
Just about any kind really.
If you had to pick one?
I would say probably southern rock.
Oh cool, I love southern rock.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Modest Mouse's "Rock the boat" is a great indie rock tune.
Are they really indie rock.
OK maybe just rock?
Yeah I think it was pretty good in its day.
So what do you think they are doing now?
Still making music but nothing huge.
They came in with a bunch of Seattle bands
They have been making music way more than that and much longer.
It was a great blend of drumming and guitars
Thats the most important element of a good rock song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite band of all time?
Oh, definitely thousand foot krutch.
What kind of music is that,  I've never heard of them.
They are awesome,  it's kind of a rap/rock mix. The lead singer is Trevor mcnevan and he's got some pipes.
Who are they similar too?
Umm idk they are pretty unique.  When i based got their CD phenomenon I hadn't heard anything like it before.
Do they play festivals? I'll be at rock on the range this year.
No way,  I'm jealous.  They may be there,  but no matter what check out hands like houses.
Oh yeah I love them.  They are similar to as lions and seconds away.
Yeah I love the alternative rock with the minor tones.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to Rock!
That's funny. I like the newer stuff like five finger death punch or adalitas way.
Yeah I'm not big on the old stuff either. Metallica and and pantera is about as old as I go.
Oh man. I love cemetery gates.
It's a shame what happened to dime bag Darrel.
Yes it is a loss for sure.
Did you see that one of the members of five finger death punch quit on stage?
I did. Do you think it's funny how they had a replacement lined up?
Yeah I think they knew it was coming.
For sure. Drugs and rock and roll right?
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm been listening to a lot of Led Zeppelin lately.
I listen to Zeppelin everyday. It blows my mind that some people don't like their music.
Anybody who doesn't like Lez Zeppelin is no friend of mine. Their music has made such an impact on how I view life.
For real. The song Stairway to Heaven has helped me get through some dark times, the song always puts a smile on my face when I hear it.
Such a great song man. I love how long it is and how time basically comes to a stand still while it's playing.
Robert Plant was blessed with a voice from the God's. The different phases of the song is what makes it such a masterpiece
Mhm. Starts off with a slow tempo followed by guitars then concludes with electrics.
Did you see that Rolling Stones top 500 songs of all time magazine? Stairway to Heaven was ranked at 31.
Really? I would have thought Stairway to Heaven would have been ranked in the top ten greatest songs of all time.
I don't agree with the rating either. I think it should have been ranked in the top 5 greatest rock songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, do you like Pavement?
Yeah, dude, one of the best bands of the '90s
Yes, yes indeed. Malkmus is a genius
And he really couldn't care less about the public's opinion
I know, right? Just straight up doin' his thing
And all the other band members
Yes, all just chilling and Ibold always grooving
To combat Malkmus's bouts of disgust with being together
Yeah. Imagine what their music would've become if they didn't split up
Yeah, it is too bad for us. But I'm sure they don't care
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your all time favorite rock band  ?
really hard to narrow it down to 1 . gun to the head Iwould pick Van Halen
well now the obvious follow up.  David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar  Van  Halen ?
Definitely Sammy !  DLR  was more of a showman  Hagar is more of a musician
My favorite Van Halen tune is Jump  I think it was Diamond Dave
yes it was they were so  so stoned in that video
haha  yes the 80s were fun I think thats why I still love 80s rock
well that and it was the best music of any generation
that is for sure . My favorite song is  is Aerosmith's  Angel
I was just going to ask you who yours was.  Wow I have not heard that 1 in a while
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you like Van Halen?
I liked some of their songs.
Me too, wasn't too thrilled with the band members.
Me either.
David Lee Roth wasn't a good front man.
No, not a good person to look at.
Eddie Van Halen was the best member in the band.
Why Can't this Be Love  with Sammy Hagar as their lead singer was a great song.
That was, but I love his Hagar.
Yes, I know you do.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you a big fan of grunge rock?
Not really.  Aside from Pearl Jam and STP, I didn't really follow any of those bands.
But there were a lot of a good bands around that time.
Yeah, and I liked some songs from those bands, like Nirvana's In Bloom.
What about Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden?
I thought the lyrics were really stupid.  I sang it once at karoke and felt really stupid singing those lyrics.
Did you ever like Green Day?
I used to like them, until they tried to be political.  I'm just thinking "you're a pseudo-punk band, you're not smart enough."
So, now you don't like them at all?
I think their new stuff is so bad that it make me retroactively hate all their music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like indie rock?
Yeah, it's such a broad category though. What do you like?
Bad Books, Young the Giant, that kind of stuff.
Oh I love Bad Books! Have you heard Manchester Orchestra?
No I haven't, I know it's the same guy, though.
It's great. Do you like fun.?
Yes, I really liked their first band The Format though.
I haven't heard of them. What would you recommend?
They only had a few albums, so I'd recommend all of them. Quite similar to fun. but more indie.
I'll check them out - I love Nate Ruess' vocals.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Metallica?
Yes they are one of my favorite rock bands.
What is your favorite song?
Enter Sandman, is a great song.
It is? Don't you remember what song we played at my sisters memorial?
Wasn't it Brown Eyed Girl?
That was at the end. What did we play at the beginning?
I'm not sure, was it a Metallica song?
Yes, it was Nothing Else Matters.
Oh yes, I remember now. It was a perfect song for her.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, Elvis, was he overrated?
Maybe in the '50s, sure, because he was a white guy doing what black artists did.
But not today?
No, I think we tend to forget about Elvis' impact today.
For me, it's another of those historical examples that tells us a lot about Fifties culture.
Sure, like, Elvis was the crack in the dam of sexual repression... he represented something bold and exciting.
And frightening to people, yet they wanted to see more.
And like Hollywood at the time, Elvis' story is this amazing self-invention in pop culture's own image.
Yeah, right down to dying his hair black to look like his favorite comic book character.
That's probably the main reason you always see Elvis and Marilyn Monroe paired off in images of the '50s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite KISS song?
That's easy. I Was Made For Loving You.
Great song.
One of the best.
I also love God OF Thunder.
Gene Simmons is great.
He is and I love the way he becomes his demon character when he's in makeup.
I know, the way he moves his head around.
They are such a great band. So many fantastic songs.
So true.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, you! With the feet attached to legs! You like Bowie?
He's alright I guess. Why are you bothering me?
What's your song? I need to know NOW.
I don't know. I don't have one. I like Bob Seger. I really like "Against the Wind".
Really? Here's a question for you: name his first Top 40 song. I'll give you help. It wasn't recorded with the Silver Bullet Band but with an earlier group--Bobby S. and the Fancy Boys.
Get the heck outta here. No such thing. And I mean it, get out of here.
So a Seger dude, huh? Then you must like Canned Heat too, am I right? Gooooing up to country blahie blah blah blah....
Oooh, look at the time and there's my bus and I think my wife's water just broke. I gotta go.
Listen to the Bowie! Listen, I say, listen!
He's dead! Get over it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music?
Yes
Thats good
Do you?
I dont listen to it that much
Its good music
Who do you like
Slipknot, metallica, led zeppelin
Who do you think i should start with
Metallica
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Our Lady Peace?
The band?  I wonder what happened to them?
I don't know, but I've been listening to their old stuff.
Yeah, they had a lot of good music.
What was your favorite song by them?
I really liked Somewhere Out There.
Oh, yeah.  I really liked that one too.
I liked it more than Superman's Dead and the others.
Yeah, I wish they'd put out some more music.
They were really good to listen too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish music did not suck today
What do you mean suck
The old stuff is the only good music
How so
Only old rock is good
That is untrue
No it is true
Their is plenty of good new rock
Not at all
Well if you are picky
XXXXXXXXXXX
How good of a band do you think Taking Back Sunday is?
Probably one of the better bands in todays music.
They wrote an album that no one will forget.
The problem is thats the only thing they did.
Would you consider them a one hit wonder
No the follow up to Tell All Your Friends was good
I dont remember any tracks from that
Because you wanted it to be a redux of Tell All Your Friends
No, I just think it wasnt that good
Well thats not really a fair point then.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Megadeath?
Not relly into Metal.
You should give them a listen.
It's not screemo is it.
No. Old school metal.
I might.
I have most of their albums.
Any one in particular you'd reccomend.
I like 'em all.
I'll have to come over and check them out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know how some bands play the same songs as other bands?
Can you give me an example?
Well the Beatles and Aerosmith are a good example.
Which song are you referring to?
Come together was done by both.
Ok I like Aerosmiths version.
Yes me too, it is more energetic.
The Beatles are great though.
Yes but for that particular song, Aerosmith did it better.
I agree, thank you for mentioning this, I had forgot about this song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I bought tickets for Lollapalooza this summer, but now my boyfriend can't go. Do you want to go with me?
Did you buy a single day pass, or a four day pass?
It's a single day pass for Friday. The tickets were $120 each.
Okay, I can go. I can pay you for the ticket next payday.
That's fine. It should be a lot of fun, I love seeing all the different bands.
Me too. Who's playing Friday?
I specifically got Friday tickets because Blink 182 is playing that day.
I LOVE Blink 182. They have so many great sing along songs.
I hope they play All The Small Things.
I like Adam's Song, even though it's incredibly sad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite genre of music?
It's probably Alternative Rock.
I like that genre too. What bands do you listen to?
My favorite band is Kings of Leon.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
Yes, I saw them live once. It introduced me to so many of their songs I had never heard befoer like Arizona.
Yeah, so many like the hits like Sex on Fire, but their other music is better.
They put on such a great show. In one song, one of the guitarists picks up his guitar and screams in it. It's called Closer.
I like that song. I recognize the sounds you are referring to.
Closer was the first track off of Only by the Night album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
See you Nickelback and Corey Taylor are fighting?
Excuse me you're going to have to wait two seconds while I stop laughing.
Your reaction is the same as mine, what a ridiculous feud.
What's the fight about?
Nickelback made some statement about writing a hit and Corey Taylor responded by calling Chad Kroeger names.
Like, schoolyard names?
Yes he mentioned something about his face being ugly.
This is the best news I have ever heard.
I knew you'd enjoy it, two bands we hate going at it, what's not to love?
Maybe they'll reconcile by writing an album together that will end the world.
XXXXXXXXXXX
twenty-one pilots are not rock music
what do you mean? the play them on the rock stations!
yeah, but they're obviously pop or rap or something
you could say the same thing about the beastie boys!
um, no. they definitely have a rock edge!
so does twenty-one pilots
the only thing edgy about that pseudo-band is how edgy they think they are
have you even heard stressed out?
okay, yeah. have yOU? because that's clearly a terrible pop song
with a good message, though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rock singer of all time?
If I had to choose just one, I'd say Eddie Vedder.
I love Pearl Jam, which album do you like best?
Ten was definitely their best album.
I agree. Vs. and Vitalogy were great too, but Ten was like nothing I'd ever heard before.
Yes, and their music videos were amazing - especially for the song Jeremy!
Jeremy's video still gives me goosebumps when I watch it.
Me too! When the boy is running in the woods you can really feel his rage.
And it was chilling how easy it was to relate to the angry kid!
Exactly! Because most everyone knew a kid like that in grade school and had no idea what they were dealing with at home.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what is your favorite type of rock music?
I really like glam rock.
Me too.  I love Queen.
Queen is the best I have been listening to a lot of their music lately.
I disovered a beautiful song of theirs.
What is the song called?
It's called Love of My Life.
I love that song and it is not as popular as their others.
I still love their hits like Bohemian Rhapsody and Bicylce though.
Me too, always a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite genre of rock music?
I think Rock & Roll would be it.
You mean from the 50s and 60s?
50s, 60s and 70s. They made some super sweet music back then.
Yeah you're right they did. What were some of your favorite artists?
Elvis Presley, The Beatles and Creedence Clearwater Revival rocked!
Those are great choices. Mine are Janis Joplin, Jimmy Hendrix and The Rolling Stones.
They all rocked! Too bad most of them are no longer around.
Yeah, it would be great to hear new music from any of them.
At least we still have The Stones around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
would you say rock music is dead nowadays?
well of course not, there are plenty of rock bands that still draw huge crowds
But doesn't there seem to be a significant lack of new rock bands these days?
I suppose, yeah. Most of the big touring acts nowadays have been touring for decades.
Why do you think that is?
I think there's a total genre shift happening in general right now - towards rap and edm.
hmm, why would rap and edm invalidate popular rock music the way it seems to?
maybe because of the technology - digital instrumentation is so sophisticated now that real instrumentation is pretty rare these days
I've noticed the distinct digital sound now - maybe it's part of a changing social philosophy?
perhaps, we're definitely looking at a different aesthetic now than we were 30 years ago.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like korn
I really havent listened to them too much
Really?
Do you like them
Love them
Whats a good song?
Freak on a leash is one of their more popular songs
That one sounds familiar
Its a good song
Ill look it up
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the band Journey?
Yes, I do, and I like the song Sherry.
My best one is Wheel in the Sky.
Is the singer Steve Perry?
Yes I think, I get it mixed with Steven Tyler alot.
Yes but Perry is not singing with them anymore.
Yeah some guy that sounds just like him though.
I can't remember his name, but he is from another country.
I like them better with the original band.
Me too, but the guy is good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember Counting Crows?
Sure.  I liked listening to them when I was in school.
Do you still listen to their music?
Not really.
Why not?
I think I liked their sound more back then.  It's just not fun to listen to anymore.
Didn't the singer used to date one of the girls from Friends?
Yeah, his name was Adam something.  I want to say he dated Courteney Cox, but it might have been Jennifer Anniston.
He was the guy with weird hair.
I don't know if it was weird, but he had dreads.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I thought that Van Halen was good after David Lee Roth.
So did I.
Sammy Hagar can really get down.
He has a raspy voice but he can get up into those higher registers.
5150 was one of their best albums.
I wonder if they are still together.
I don't know, but you could Google it.
It would be great to see them live again.
Eddie Van Halen is probably one of the best guitarists in the world.
Without a doubt he is.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you able to watch that new documentary about The Eagles?
Sure did! My dad and I watched the entire thing a few nights ago.
No way! I watched it with my dad also, he's a huge Eagles fan.
I think any man born in the 1960's is an Eagles fan. Their music is still amazing today. What's your favorite song?
Hard choice but I really enjoy listening to Life in the Fast Lane. It gets me pumped when I'm riding my motorcycle.
I love that song too but Hotel California is still my all time favorite.
I think both songs were released on the same album.
Indeed they were. The album is called Hotel California. It was released in 1976.
If I'm not mistaken, that album is one of the greatest selling albums of all time.
With 32 million copies sold world wide, I'd say you are correct my friend.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band is your favorite?
I've been a big fan of Foo Fighters since forever.
Oh yeah, they are awesome, I like them too.
Yeah and Dave Grohl is awesome in the band.
Yeah, did you know he was the drummer for Nirvana?
Yeah of course! He's also a band member in Queens of the Stone Age.
Ah yeah, their song No One Knows rocks!
Yeah, I'm listening to it now.
I'm listening to Foo Fighter's song Everlong.
Oh man; that's gotta be my favorite track by them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man these tunes are rocking
What are you rocking out to
I am rocking out to some pretty cool tunes
Well what album
Pantera Cowboys from hell
oooh i love that album
Its a banger
I know isnt it
Their best album to be honest
Nah i think Far beyond driven is their best
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like system of a down
Yes
I do too
I really like their song chop suey
Same here
Its a great song
I love listening to it
Me too
Im going to dog out my old cd now
I might too
XXXXXXXXXXX
So rock is pretty old, I know--my dad used to go on about it—but I feel confused about how the genre really started?
Yeah me too, but I took a couple classes on American Popular Music in college and that really cleared some things up.
So what did you learn?
Well, I think a lot of it has to do with marketing categories, how the industry sold music to consumers. Which surprised me.
Whoa, I didn't realize the music business was so commercial back in the day.
Yeah, it's super ridiculous when people talk about music being commercial today....It's ALWAYS been commercial in American Popular Music this century.
So what were some of these marketing categories? That influenced rock music?
The way I understand it, rock kind of emerged as a confluence between Rhythm & Blues and Country& Western.
Well, that kind of makes sense.
But I was even more fascinated to learn that those categories don't divide up as neatly along racial lines as some of the pop culture stories (especially about Elvis) might make you think!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wanna rock.
I wanna roll.
Kiss was like my favorite rock band.
Yeah but Gene Simmons was a womanizer.
Twisted Sister had some epic songs
You're gonba burn in hell was my favorite.
What was your favorite rock band?
Definitely Motley Crue.
I had a crush on Tommy Lee and Brett Michaels.
Witg their long hair and eye makeup they look like ladies.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey I was thinking about old bands from the 70's....Queen.
I love Queen. Freddie Mercury had such an incredible voice.
His range was unbelievable, right?
Yeah, you would be hard pressed to find anybody with that range.
Amazing... no doubt. I love Bohemian Rhapsody.
I remember Another One Bites The Dust.
We Will Rock You.
They had such incredible music.
I know. They were so innovative and creative.
Yeah, I think they went all out for their music. Got to be one of the best bands of all time. Better than the Beatles.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Metallica is a great band!
You're right. They are one of the most popular metal bands in the world.
James Hetfield is probably one of my favorite musicians ever,
Is he in Metallica?
He is! He is the lead vocalist of the band.
Does he play any instruments in the band?
Indeed he does. He also plays rhythm guitar.
I read that he is one of the founders of the band too.
You're correct. He is.
He must be so proud of how much the band has achieved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best rock concert you ever saw?
I went to see AC/DC on their Who Made Who Tour and they knocked my socks off!
Angus Young is an amazing performer, who opened up for them?
Guns N Roses opened for them, and they were great too.
Oh sure, and now Axl Rose is singing with AC/DC, isn't he?
I believe so, now that Brian Johnson left the band for medical reasons.
Brian Johnson is a hard act to follow, his voice is so distinct.
It is, but Axl has put his own spin on things.
All of the other members of AC/DC are phenomenal, but you first notice that lead singer.
You're right, I don't know how diehard fans of AC/DC are going to feel about Axl singing lead.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember when Creed was huge?
It was a bad time in rock music
Higher was such a huge hit
But it was not good
I dont know alot of people liked it.
It always amazes me how album sales means a band is good
Why would people buy bad music
I dont know look at Creed
They havent done anything new
Yeah and thats my point they didnt have hits outside of Higher.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do The Rolling Stones keep making music?
Not sure what you mean.
They haven't produced a good album in probably 30 years.
I have to admit, I can't think of a single song that's come out recently.
In my opinion, they're just old and don't care.
Well, they have their money, their fame, their women.
At this point, it's just kind of creepy.
Drugs probably caught up to them too.
Yeah.  Mick Jagger might explode if he tries to dance anymore.
That would be pretty cool to see.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Ramones album?
Wow that's a hard one, first three were all so good.
It's tough but you must decide, mine is Rocket to Russia.
Great choice, guess mind would have to be their self titled album.
Also a great choice, you really can't go wrong with any of their early stuff.
Definitely agree, my other half for example would probably choose Leave Home.
Ha interesting that we would all three have different choices, but I think it just goes to show how tough a choice it is.
Yeah rarely has any rock band, independent if genre had three albums of that caliber to start their career.
Absolutely and to think critics of the time were so confused by them.
Yeah no one had ever been quite like them before, took awhile to grow on people.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember in Junior High what song everyone played on the Juke Box at lunch?
I sure do. Hot Blooded.
Everyone went ot get a slice of pizza and listen to music.
Foreigner was played a lot on that Juke Box.
Then it was Double Vision.
What was the next song we played too much?
Juke Box Hero.
Foreigner was a big part of our school years.
Yes, and those songs are still good now.
Some rock songs always will be.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you listen to Rush when you were younger?
No. Never really liked them..
Me either. They did have a couple good songs.
Like what?
Tom Sawyer was good.
Yeah, that was.
There was also Force Ten.
I don't know that song.
Wasn't played much on radio.
I never had any albums to hear other songs.
XXXXXXXXXXX
ac/dc is the best rock group ever.
they are good but they are nothing compared to grateful dead
AC/DC had the best to vocals of all time
yes but grateful dead are game changers
they are not game changer they are just old
old my ass the still jam hardcore whats your problem?
AC/DC is my problem. go and listen to the Iron Man two sound track
i cant beliave you would compaie the two
yeah they both are great
yeah, but Queen is better then both.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It's amazing how much the rock genre has grown over the years.
It really is. Hard to believe it went from Elvis Presley to spawning so many sub-genres.
Some of those sub-genres even ended up becoming big too!
I'm guessing you mean heavy metal?
That'd definitely be the best example. There's a lot of other ones, though.
Punk rock comes to mind.
Yes! That sub-genre has developed its own culture by this point.
Punk rock is actually my favorite rock sub-genre.
Nice. Who's your favorite band?
I'd definitely have to go with Black Flag on that one.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever hear of the band July Talk?
No I haven't what are they like?
They're a rock group from Canada with a male and female vocalist.
Oh that's cool, I like bands with two vocalists.
I know you do, these two play off of each other really well, great chemistry.
What do they sound like?
July Talk kind of has this indie/bluesy feel to them, with a hard edge.
Oh that sounds right up my alley.
They're playing a show two hours away next month if you wanted to check them out.
I sure do, just get me familiar with some of their tracks.
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you could pick one rock band to listen to, who would you pick?
I'm a huge eighties fan.  I particularly like Def Leppard.
Yes.  They are pretty good.  I like the power of their sound.
I know, and they've been around forever.  I think over 30 years.
What's your favorite song of theirs.
I've always liked "Photograph".
I know.  It was one of their first songs and probably one of their best songs.
They have been through so much, it's amazing they are still going relatively strong.
Yes.  A lot of rock bands lose members to death and just quitting, but not many can say their drummer lost his arm.
Amazing how he plays with those pedals.  You can't even tell from listening that anything is different.
XXXXXXXXXXX
i love when modern rock bands cover the beatles
oh, that does sound cool.
i'll give you an example. the flaming lips had a whole album!
really. that sounds really cool, i love the flaming lips
their sgt. pepper cover is honestly the coolest thing since sliced bread
i believe it
they did have miley cyrus on a song or two...
wow...automatically less cred
her voice worked really well for the songs, though!
eh, i'll have to hear it to believe it
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember seeing Guns and Roses live in concert.
When was that?
Back in 1992 I went to a concert in the new stadium.
Axel Rose has a mean temper.
At the concert he got into it with someone in the crowd.
Wow. How was the music?
Their rendition of Paradise City was the best, but the whole show was good.
I wish I could have been there.
Slash can play a mean guitar.
That guy has some serious musical talent.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like John Lennon solo music?
I love it.
When double fantasy came out in 1980 I was so excited.
It was a long time coming for him.
Yea,he,went away and,disappeared in the seventies pretty much.
Too bad the idiot had to kill him.
He had a lot more to contribute.
Yes he did.
Double fantasy went to number one,didn't it?
Yes it did. Shot up the charts!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to rock music at all?
I sure do. It's probably my favorite genre of music.
Who is your favorite band?
I would say that the Red Hot Chili Peppers are probably my favorite, and I also really like Nirvana.
Those are two good choices. Have you ever seen the Red Hot Chili Peppers in concert?
I haven't, but I'm thinking about trying to get tickets the next time they go on tour.
My favorite band is probably Green Day.
It's funny how everyone thinks the song "Time of Your Life" is about something different than what it really is.
Yeah, people play it at graduations like it is a good thing.
It's like they cannot figure out that it is about the end of a relationship that he was in.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Black Veil Brides?
No, what's that?
It's a band.
Do they have any popular songs?
Yes, depending on which stations you listen to.
Well then I probably wouldn't know them.
Our daughter played some songs and they are real good.
Any songs I"d know?
In the End.
Okay, I do know that song. I like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey
Hey
Do you like rock music?
Yeah absolutely.
What is your favorite genre of rock?
Genre?
Yeah like heavy metal, jam band, blues, that kind of thing.
Oh.  I really like hard rock, but I wouldn't call it heavy metal.
Like who?
Guns and Roses is probably my favorite band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the band Motley Crue?
Yes, I loved them.
Me too.
What was your favorite song?
Looks that Kill, of course.
Me too. That was a great album.
Another good song was Shout at the Devil.
You're right. Loved that one too.
I got to see them once in concert.
You're lucky, I never did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I won tickets yesterday for a concert !!!
Really? What band is it?
The Dave Matthews Band- can you believe it? They rock!
How did you get so lucky?
Saratoga Living Magazine and Saratoga Social were having a contest for free tickets.
What did you have to do to enter?
All I had to do was "like" both their facebook pages, and then they randomly picked someone.
Where are they playing at?
The Saratoga Performing Arts Center- and I won two tickets. Do you want to go?
Of course! I love the songs "Satellite" and "Crash Into Me."
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard my favorite music couple isn't going to be on The Voice tv show anymore. Gwen Stefani supposedly isn't returning, but Blake is.
They're still together though, aren't they?
Yeah, but I'll miss seeing them make cute faces at each other.
I don't know, I always thought they were a weird couple- she's an alternative rock star and he's a country star.
I know, her band No Doubt and her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale's band Bush were both alternative rock bands, so they seemed like a perfect couple.
It just seems like they would have had a lot more in common, her and Gavin both been rock stars, like they would have enjoyed listening to the same music.
It doesn't seem like she would have a lot in common with Blake, he's a country boy who likes hunting, and she's a California girl who loves make-up and clothes.
Well, you know what they say about opposites attract.
I think it was more a rebound affair after Gavin cheating. Not surprising he did, touring so much with women throwing themselves at him.
Maybe Gwen and Blake will give each other a new admiration of their respective music genres.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So have you heard about the devil's blood?
what is devil's blood?
you don't know what devil's blood is?
I just have no idea.
It's a very famous rock band from netherlands.
Oh, I never heard of them.
Trust me, they are very famous.
I guess they are not that famous here in america.
I would say a lot of americans know about them.
Then maybe they are not very famous in my neighborhood.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the band Guns N' Roses?
Absolutely.
They are one of my favorites.
Who is your favorite band member?
With out a doubt it is Slash.
I agree, he can really play guitar.
Have you ever seen the video for November Rain?
I have.
I like when he is playing the solo outside the church.
That is pretty awesome, I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, what do you think of David Bowie?
I think he was amazing. Very underrated, in a way.
Underrated? What do you mean?
Well, when Bowie died, there were lots of tributes to him, calling him brilliant and all that.
And I remember thinking "wow, everyone's a huge Bowie fan all of a sudden?"
Yeah, those trendy celebrities. But no, I feel like musically, he contributed a lot.
People might not realize it if they only buy his albums because they're hip and cool.
Yes, Bowie is a case where a compelling image is just the surface.
He went through so many phases and changes, not just in fashion...
Yeah, but in music, too. He truly reinvented himself with each album and was a true original.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock bands with male or female lead singers?
I prefer them with female singers. Women like Lacey from Flyleaf Rock!
I like all rock music equally, although I will agree that Lacey has an amazing voice.
Do you prefer hard rock or soft rock?
I love really heavy rock. I love how bands like Rob Zombie pump me up.
Rob Zombie is so cool, I bet he would be great live at a concert especially with all the special effects hes known for.
I would love to go to one of his concerts but the price....maybe one day. Who is your favorite rock band?
I really love Evanescence. Nobody can even compare to her pure vocal talent.
I really enjoy Metallica. Enter Sandman is my all time favorite song ever.
Older rock is cool, the newer rock coming out is definitely different though, some of it is worth looking into.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the band Soundgarden?
I love them! I sure hate that Chris Cornell died.
Yeah that was tragic. He was the lead singer of Audioslave also.
Yes I love their song "Like A Stone." That's my favorite from them.
They really helped put grunge on the map in the 90s.
I still iisten to grunge. I even turned my kids onto it.
Really? I wish I could get my kids to appreciate old school rock.
All you have to do is show them what's great about it and they'll slowly tune in.
That sounds like a good idea. The video for Black Hole Sun was awesome.
Right I remember thinking at the time how no one had done anything like that before.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think the idea of the "rock star" is still relevant?
Well sure, why wouldn't it be?
Well, rock is no longer the genre of youth - most popular rock is classic rock these days.
I suppose that's true. Still, what define a rock star?
I'd define rock star as an iconoclast, in the vein of cobain and osbourne. It's hard to find figures like that in music these days.
Why do you think that is?
Well, the changing music industry is forcing bands to be more self-sufficient and promote themselves.
True, it's hard to imagine drug-addled early Ozzy also serving as his own accountant
Exactly - I think that level of self sufficient responsibility being necessary has stifled music and modern creativity in general
If that's true, yeah, I can see why that would kill off the viability of the "rock star". Too much social responsibility is required nowadays for people to be throwing TVs out of hotel windows.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So my dad is listening to lots of The Grateful Dead lately.
Man, they've been around forever.
Yeah, he's a true Deadhead as they call them.
Wasn't the lead singer Jerry Garcia.
Yeah.  He died a while back though.
Who sings for them now?
I'm not really sure.  I know they tour all the time though.
Yeah, and they make a killing doing it too I think.
They've had some of the highest-grossing tours the last ten years.
Guess their fanbase is bigger than I thought.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think that rock music is still viable?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of other genres available today.
Yes, that's true. Hip hop and country are strong competitors.
Yes, and classic rock seems to be the main genre of rock.
What's wrong with that?
Well, it's kind of a dead genre.
What do you mean?
Well, there can't really be new classic rock as something new can't be old.
I disagree. Over time, the classic rock genre incorporates new classics. It just takes time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock?
I do. What should I listen to.
Have you ever heard of The Mars Volta?
No, who are they?
They are a couple of guys from Texas that make great music.
It is just two guys?
Well, there are actually a bunch, but there are two leaders.
That sounds really cool. What kind of music is it?
It's progressive rock. Check it out.
I will do this very soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some of your favorite rock groups?
I;m more old school.  I like Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and Metallica.
Those bands are good.  They don't make them like that anymore.
Of course you have Nirvana.  They were amazing.
Do you like AC DC and Queen?
Not as much as the other bands I mentioned, but they are still some of the best of all time.
What about the Rolling Stones and Kiss?
You know, I respect their talent and what they have done, but I have never been a huge fan of those two grops
I almost forgot about Guns and Roses and the Who
Now your talking!  Another two groups that are some of the best ever.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Okay, who is your favorite 80's rock bad still performing today?
Well, I'd have to say that it is Bon Jovi
Ah, that is a good bad. What's one of your favorite songs?
It would have to Wanted Dead or Alive.
Well, I prefer Its my Life.
That's good, but what about One WIld Night?
That's a good one as well, but what's one you like from they're more recent work?
How about Have a Nice Day?
Yeah, that's good. Ever seen the music video for it?
Yes, though I thought the tramp stamp tattoo of the logo was a bit much.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rock artist
I'm a big fan of KISS
Wow, thats very old school. Why do you like them
I was raised on their music through my dad, so it's all nostalgic to me. Plus they sound great
I've never really heard of their songs though
Are you a fan of hard rock
Yeah, I guess. Never get a chance to listen though
I recommend I was Made for Lovin' You. It's a classic
I'll have to listen then
It's one of their most famous songs
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Green Day?
Yes
I really liked their song Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Me too
It kind of spoke to me on some level
Me too
Its a good song
I also liked american idiot
That one was okay
I thought it was good
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Pink Floyd?
Yes. I love their music.
What is your favorite song?
Another Brick in the Wall
That is a classic
it is. I also like Mother.
What about Wish You Were Here?
That's a good one too.
I think some of their songs drag on for too long.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Was just listening to one of my favorite Rock bands.
Who's that?
KISS. Got to love them.
They are really good.
They've been around forever. Even our kids like them.
Really? They don't like pop music?
They like all kinds. They went to a KISS concert a few years ago with us.
That's neat that the whole family enjoys somehthing.
My favorite song is Crazy Night.
That is a good one. I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hey.
Do you listen to rock music?
Yeah sure.
Do you have a favorite genre of rock?
Well there are so many.  Let me think.
Sure.
I love Southern Rock.  Probably my favorite.
Oh like The Allman Brothers?
Yeah exactly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of  Red Hot Chili Peppers.
They are good.
I like their singer the best.
He has a very unique voice.
What is your favorite song?
Soul to Squeeze
That's a classic.
Have you seen them live?
No, but I always wanted to.
I bet they are great live.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you heard of Family Force 5?
Nope
What how?!
I just haven't.
You never heard, Love Addict?
Nope
What about Earthquake
Not that one either
How about This is my year, the matoma remake
OH I LOVE THAT SONG
XXXXXXXXXXX
Mariah Carrey is overrated.
Can't help but agree with you there!
Ariana Grande is doing us all a favor.
What do you mean?
Taking Mariah's spot in pop culture.
God, I hope so. I'm about done hearing Mariah scream.
Yeah, I'm ready to hear Ariana's sick whistle notes.
Personally I want to hear silence, but you do you.
Into You is a good song and you know it!
I guess
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think is the worst rock band of all time?
Nickelback, hands down. If you can even call them a rock band.
Haha! I would have to agree.
I mean all of their songs sound the same.
I feel like the say he sings and his voice makes him sound like he's trying too hard.
It's just like generic wannabe rock music. There was nothing unique about them.
Yet, their songs like "How You Remind Me" and "Photograph" were huge hits.
Yea and they overplayed them so much. It was so annoying.
Maybe that's why everyone loves to hate on Nickelback's music, because it was just generic rock songs that were highly overplayed.
Probably. Or people just have bad taste in music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like live rock shows?
Yeah sure.
When was the last time you saw a live band play?
I saw a local rock band a few nights ago.
How was it?
It was pretty great actually.  I wasn't expecting much but they were really good.
What kind of music was it.
They were a blues band that was really together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why does everyone rave about the Greatful Dead so much!
I have no clue.
I couldn't even tell you one of their songs.
Sitting on Top of the World?
Oh, yeah. That was all right.
No too much to get worked up about.
You're not a Dead Head either?
Far from it.
Jerry Garcia was a pretty interesting fellow though.
True.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What are some rock bands you don't really like?
I never got into Van Halen.  I mean, sure they've got some good songs, but I wasn't that into them.
How about Aerosmith?
Dude, the first cd I ever got was Get a Grip.
I really liked a lot of their 80s and early 90s stuff, like Cryin, and Amazing.
So, any video they released with Alicia Silverstone?
I assure you, it's a coincidence.  I thought Nine Lives was an underrated album, too.
Yeah, I liked Hole in my Soul.
Favorite Aerosmith song?
I got a couple:  Dream On, their cover of Come Together, Deuces are Wild, and Jaded.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Metallica?
I did when I was much younger.
Not so much anymore?
Nah, I can't listen to that heavy stuff anymore.
What was your favorite song of there's?
I was really into Enter Sandman back in the day
Oh yeah. Do you remember that music video for that one?
Yeah, that was the one with the truck in the dream.
Yeah, ran over the bed.
yeah, oh man 90s rock and MTV
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is you favorite 90's band?
I'd have to go with Oasis.
They were pretty good.
They didn't stay together very long.
Brothers!
Those dudes were brothers?
Not all of them.
Who, then?
Liam and Noel Gallagher.
Huh, I had no clue.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You're a metal fan, right?
Absolutely.
Do you still see it as a sub-genre of rock?
To a degree, yes I do. Without rock, there would be no metal.
Then why say to a degree?
Because metal is very much it's own thing these days. It even has it's own sub-genres.
I've heard it might even have more than rock itself.
Maybe. Rock has ones like punk, grunge, alternative, indie, stoner, rockabilly, and some others.
What does metal have?
Thrash metal, death metal, black metal, doom metal, metalcore, deathcore, sludge metal, grindcore, and so many others. There's a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the band that covered the Michael Jackson song "Smooth Criminal?"
You are thinking of Alien Ant Farm
Have you heard of them recently?
No I havent heard from them since that song
Well they did have that other song Movies
OK so they had two hits off the same record
Yeah I guess that would qualify them as duds.
Yes they werent that great to begin with
So making a cover as your first song is probably the wrong way to go
Its the easy way to go but if you arent good you will sink quickly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into rock music?
Occasionally.
What songs?
Heads Explode.
By Monster Magnet?
Yes.
Oh that song just has such a weird title.
I agree but it is a good song.
Fair enough. I have been listening to Dispatch a lot lately.
Oh I love their sound!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock band?
I am currently loving Fozzy!
I don't know if I know that band.
Chris Jericho is the lead singer.
The wrestler?
Yes! He is very good.
What is one of their songs?
Judas. It has over 5 million views on Youtube in a month.
I will check the video out.
You should. It is worth it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm glad Avenged Sevenfold dropped that new album
Ya, the last one was a little too "Metallica" for me
How about that new drummer, Brooks Wackerman?
Is he the one that replaced The Rev?
No, they had Mike Portnoy for a while, then Arin Illijay, and now Brooks.
Oh, so what do you think of him?
Actually I really like him, his sound is a lot more like their original sound
Ah, I see, so you like their new album then?
Yes, a few songs are weird but mostly it's very good; especially 'Sunny Disposition'
I'll have to check that one out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you enjoy Deep Purple?
I like some of their stuff.
Are they very good?
They are one of the top rock bands.
I like their sound
When did they come around?
In the late 60's I think
Do you have any of their albums.
I have a couple
I love Machine Head.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been keeping up on the latest rock music?
Yes, I wouldn't miss it for the world. You?
I have been listening to the new song by Metallica!
What's it called?
It's called 'Now that We're Dead' and it's fantastic!
I'll have to check it out. I really like the latest by the Foo Fighters.
They have a new one? What do they call it?
It's called 'Run' and it has some interesting vocals.
I really need to update my playlist and include that.
Me too, I'll have to see the latest rock hits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lets talk about metallica
Okay i love that band
Me too
They are performing in orlando florida next week
I wish i was there
Me too
I want to see them so bad
They are also going to georgia
I'm not in georga either
Me either

Did you hear about the hoax about Axl Rose from Guns and Roses?
No, what happened?
Somebody put up a Facebook page on June 20th saying RIP Axl Rose, with an obituary saying he had passed away, asking people to sign their condolences on the page.
He didn't really die?
No, apparently fake death hoaxes has become quite the thing, but a bunch of people fell for it and were signing the page and upset by it.
What kind of sick person thinks it's funny pretending someone has died?
Quite a few sickos I guess, since apparently a long list of celebrities have had this kind of hoax reported about them.
I don't think it's funny upsetting people who believed it was true.
A bunch of fans questioned it, because it wasn't being reported by major news sources, but hundreds of fans fell for it and were writing condolence messages on the page.
Guns and Roses had some really devoted fans, so I can imagine there were a lot of upset fans when they read that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rock band?
I like AC/DC
They are a very classic band!
Yeah, my favorite song is Thunderstruck
That song has such a fast guitar!
I dont know how he even does it!
Do you have a 2nd favorite band?
I would say Queen
Freddie Mercury is the bet singer of all time!
Yeah that's why the have so many hits!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Alot of early Rock music came out of Memphis.
That's where I am from.
Really that's interesting. Have you been to Sun Studios?
No, but I worked down the street from there.
Carl Perkins, Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis all recorded there.
Johnny Cash did too.
Memphis is a big music town.
They have alot of live music rock shows too.
I loved Elvis' "Blue Suede Shoes".
Elvis could really move those hips and bang out some rock and roll.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Soundgarden had a huge influence on rock in the 90s
Black Hole Sun was a song that will stand the test of time.
What else did they write?
Spoonman was also big
Cornell was also in Audioslave.
Man they are 2 huge rock bands.
Yeah and their music spanned the globe.
They did tour alot from what I heard
Yes and they wrote so many great rock albums
I just dont remember much being as influential as Black Hole Sun
XXXXXXXXXXX
Jimmy Eat World is probably one of my favorite bands from long ago.
You consider early millennium long ago?
Well, I am in my 30's.
They've had a few recent songs.
I haven't checked out any new stuff lately.
You should.  Sure and Certain was on the radio recently and it's pretty tight.
Huh.  I'll have to go look for it on Youtube.
Check out The End is Beautiful too.
Okay, sounds like a plan.
Glad I could help.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Dude, did you hear that Guns N Roses are back together?
Oh yeah? Are they writing new material?
No, right now they're just touring. But its a start! Maybe they'll write new music soon.
I've never liked Axl Rose, but they had some pretty good songs. I like Slash though.
Yeah, his solo stuff is good. Have you heard any of his albums?
Yeah, I like his work with Myles Kennedy.
Yeah, Myles is such a good singer. I really like his work with Alter Bridge. His singing style really works well with Tremonti's guitar playing.
Definitely much better than Scott Stapp, that's for sure.
Yeah, I agree. Myles has actual range and emotion.
I think he elevates every musician he plays with.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you remember U2's Boy album?
Yeah, that was such a great album. They have had a really long career.
What do you think is your favorite album by them?
Joshua Tree maybe. No War.
Both excellent choices. I love Sunday Bloody Sunday.
With or Without You....all I have to say.
Yeah but those are definitely different times and the music reflects that.
Yeah, still those guys influenced a lot of music.
The Alarm kind of reminds me of that time period too. I mean for Boy.
That's a good band. Wonder what ever happened to them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think rock is as good as it used to be?
I think rock comes and goes in waves. Right now, it's kind of boring.
I agree. The last rock band I really loved was The Killers.
They're great, kind of a rockier version of Duran Duran.
Are you listening to anybody else?
Right now I'm really into classic rock and roll.
You mean like Chuck Berry?
Exactly! Anything on Chess Records or so.
I'm a big Buddy Holly fan.
Buddy Holly and Elvis are two of my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who has been the biggest rock band of the 2000s decade?
Thats tough because there was an influx of artists at that time.
I could argue it was Creed.
And I could counter that with Nickelback.
Those arent 2 great bands though.
I know, System of a Down had a huge impact.
Toxicity was a big track in its day.
Yeah and then you could say other bands spawned off of that.
I guess Its tough to really nail down one specific band.
Unless you say Foo Fighters but that sounds lazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Sum 41 still a band?
I dont remember them doing anything after the song Fat Lip
That was a huge pop hit
I would say it was rock
You could say it was pop punk if you wanted.
Yeah I just remember the video for it was pretty good.
It was an anthem at the time.
So they dont tour anymore?
I think they do just their fanbase is older.
Its a shame because they sounded like they could write a huge hit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey fellow Zombie!
Hi! You like The Pretty Reckless too?
Oh yes! Taylor rocks!
She sure does! Don't you just love TPR's song "Take Me Down"?
Yes I do! I like the bridge part where she goes "Sign with the devil!"
Yep, that's the best part of the song!
I love how she wears her make-up too! So dark and gorgeous!
Same here. Eyeliner always on point!
Yes. Another great song by her is "Light Me Up".
It is for sure, that song touches my heart.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Elvis Presley sure was amazing!
He sure was!!!
He had so many number one hits.
I know! Hounddog, Jailhouse Rock, Blue Suede Shoes were all hits.
I liked some of the later songs too like Suspicious Minds.
It was a shame he died so young.
He would have had so many more songs to sing if he had lived.
That is true.
I went to Graceland once, did you ever go?
No but I would love too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Led Zeppelin?
I think their songwriting is really good. I don't listen to them much, though.
Yeah a lot of people only judge them by "Stairway to Heaven".
That's actually one of the only songs I know by them.
What rock bands do you listen to?
I really love Black Sabbath.
They are great. Ozzy is the man.
He is wild. Their music just has a sense of style to it.
Yeah it's very dark and stylistic.
I feel like they were making music that no one else was at the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't listen to a lot of rock music, can you tell me some good songs to check out?
Well, one of my all time favorite rock bands is Journey. Have you heard of them?
Yes, weren't they popular in the 80's and 90's?
Yep, They even toured more recently, but with a new lead singer. He's really good though!
So what songs should I start with to hear their best music?
The song called Don't Stop Believing is one of my favorites. It's a classic rock song from the 80's.
Who was the lead singer for them in the 80's?
His name is Steve Perry and he has an amazing voice. He went solo for awhile too.
What else should I check out from Journey?
That album with the song I mentioned is called Escape. It has some great songs and it would be a great album to start with!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man you like rock music I've been trying to find a good band to listen to.
Oh yeah, I love rock music. I take it you are looking for something more modern and not the classics right?
Yeah. Don't get me wrong I love AC/DC, Iron Madien, and what not but I want something fresh.
I got to be honest with you, most of the rock bands of the 2000's except for a small few just didn't stand up to the oldies.
Which small few?
Well you had system of a down, shine down, 30 seconds to mars, and maybe creed. Other than that I can't recommend any.
You see thats my exact problem. No one new has that rock sound that I love. It's all a different sound and most least unappealing.
I agree whole heartedly with you, I guess we will have to wait until a band brings the sound we like.
It doesn't seem like that is going to happen.
Have some faith, they have some good modern ock songs out there.
XXXXXXXXXXX
MTV used to be awesome.
I know what happened?
The internet happened.
Yeah, I guess.
Still, the 80s were awesome.
I know, remember the Beastie Boys?
My mom hated the Beasties.
Mine too.
Big hair music and my sister was in love with Bon Jovi
Ha, what happened to him?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was the band that did the song for the "More Cowbells" skit on SNL?
Blue Oyster Cult?
Oh yeah.  Did they have any other songs besides that?
Yeah, they had a few.
What were they?
Well, the most popular was probably "Burnin for You."
Right.  I have heard that before.
I know.  It's just you always associate them with The Reaper.
Yeah, The Reaper has that awesome guitar solo.
That's one of my favorite solos ever.  I love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
do you think emo music even counts as rock music?
yeah, i think so. emo music is kind of a vast genre at this point
true!
it can be anything from bright eyes to taking back sunday
but would you say those are rock bands?
yeah, i would! taking back sunday uses rock instruments, they're clearly a rock band.
what about bright eyes, though? is that still rock?
soft rock, but i would say rock nonetheless.
songs like cleanse song make bright eyes seem a little closer to baroque pop
i guess that's the cool thing about music. all the blurred lines
XXXXXXXXXXX
Nirvana was the Beatles of the 90s generation.
Yes, Kurt Cobain was their John Lennon.
I wonder if we will see a popular band like that again in our lifetimes?
I'm not sure, it seems like people don't have the patience for bands and albums anymore.
Yes, and all bands seem to have a hard time making new fans.
That's right. Music seems a lot more fragmented these days.
Could it be that consumers are more interested in solo artist?
Yes, that's possible. It seems like we are a more self-driven society.
The concept of people working together doesn't seem to be appealing to most people anymore
I think social media has something to do with that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Rock music ever?
Yes all of the time.
Who is your favorite artist?
I love Cage the Elephant.
Oh me too!
What song do you like?
I like the song Whole Wide World.
I have not heard that but I will take a listen sometime.
I also like The Cribs.
The song Year of Hate is pretty good by them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the Rolling Stones?
I never really followed their music, but there are a few songs I really like by them.
What are your favorites?
I like Beast of Burden and Paint it Black.  I probably like Sympathy for the Devil the best.
I always forget about Sympathy for the Devil.  It was such a good song.
Yeah, the storytelling in the lyrics are awesome.
I think the song was used in a movie I've seen.
I wouldn't doubt it.
The one I saw had the devil or a demon hopping from one person to another.
Oh, I know what you are talking about, but I don't remember the name.  The song played at the end.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like Queen?
LOVE Queen!
Man Bohemian Rhapsody is fantastic!
And We will Rock You!
Heck yeah! We are the champions is like the sequal to that song!
That's an amazing way to put it!
How about the song, I want it all?
Which one?
I want it all!
Fine take it all!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I think ACDC is awesome
Nah only one of their eras was any good
What era
The one with the one singer
who?
Bon scott he was the only good one
Well bon scott is good but not the only
Hah i beg to differ
As do i
Well you are clearly wrong
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rock music is stupid.
Oh, yeah? Studies show that rock music have the most intelligent lyrics of all types of music.
It just talks about sex, drugs, and partying-like all other music.
Listen to Rush. They don't deal in those types of lyrics. "The Pass" is a great example.
Why would I want to listen to people without talent and just make noise?
Rush's Alex Lifeson took a 5th century monastic tune and turned it into a melody for one of their songs. Neil Peart is regarded as one of the greatest rock drummers ever. Watch his solo videos.
All you talk about is Rush. What about all the others?
From Buddy Holly, to the Beatles, to Led Zeppelin, their music stands the test of time. Most other music (except country) won't be relatable in the next 5 years.
Well, it's all noise to me.
Just listen with an open ear and mind, and you'll laugh at the hiphop and rap stuff after a while.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have tickets for the Smashing Pumpkins concert this weekend, do you want to go?
No, I used to like that band, but I didn't like it when they broke up and got new band members.
I know what you mean. Jimmy Chamberlin was a great drummer, and that new kid doesn't compare.
They were great in the 90s, but now their music is ho-hum.
I know, I still go to their concerts just hoping they play some old songs.
They used to have great music videos back in the day when MTV used to play music videos all the time.
Oh man, I MISS MTV music videos. They were the best!
80s rock music videos were even better than the 90s. Remember "I Want My MTV?"
OH, and remember when Beavis and Butthead used to do the commentary on music videos?
Beavis and Butthead ROCKED.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just discovered a new band that doesn't use any guitar, but they still rock! They're called Royal Blood.
Oh yeah! They're just a bass player and a drummer right?
Yeah, but they still know how to rock. The bassist put a guitar pickup in his bass to flesh the sound out a bit more. I just saw them at a big festival.
Oh that sounds cool! Who else did you see?
I feel lucky, because Soundgarden played, and it was one of Chris Cornell's last performances before his passing.
I'm still really upset about that. I can't believe that happened! Did he sound good when you saw them?
He sounded amazing. Very energetic, and he talked to the crowd a lot. I was just so stunned by this.
Me too. I saw them many years ago, and they put on a killer show. Definitely one of the best grunge bands.
I agree. I love Soundgarden and Pearl Jam the most, so of course I absolutely adore Temple of the Dog.
Oh yeah! I heard they reunited last year and went on tour! I bet that was something else.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm glad to see Third Eye Blind still going strong.
I am too but it's also bittersweet knowing that there's only two left from the original lineup.
That's always disheartening but new blood can bring new flavors to the music.
I guess so but Kevin Cadogan and Stephen Jenkins were magic together.
That I cannot deny so I agree that it's sad to see them not writing together.
Not that I don't like their new stuff, Dopamine was a great record.
Glad you agree, lots of great and catchy stuff on there.
Heck, I even liked the follow up EP We Are Drugs.
I think that EP is their strongest work since Blue in my opinion.
Better than Out Of The Vein, you're crazy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to Def Leppard?
Yes the one with the drummer who had no leg or arm?
He lost him arm in a car accident.
Yes but he came back and played good.
What was your favorite song?
Pour Some Sugar on Me, of course.  What's yours?
That is my favorite too, but so was Photograph.
Were they British or American?
They were British.
We got alot of great bands from Britain.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You remember when Green Day was good?
That was a long time ago.  American Idiot was pretty much their peek.
Back in the 90's, they had some good hits.  Dookie was a solid album.
The last ten years or so has been pretty bad though.
I think their time has passed.  No one cares about alternative anymore.
Yeah, top 40 kind of got replaced by all the electronic junk.
I kind of wish they would have progressed past three chords.
Well, it's what made them money hence why they stuck with it.
It's hard to think those guys are in their late 40's now and so old.
Hey, you'll be old too someday!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Why do you like rock?
It's a great release of energy
what do you mean
the shouting and the lyrics have so much energy that it makes me feel good
What bands give you that good feeling
Mostly Green day
Yeah their lyrics are pretty powerful
Yeah, especially American Idiot
Why that song?
It hits close to home as an american citizen. Green Day really wrote some great lyrics in regard to that
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Iron Maiden song?
That's a tough one but I think it's Fear of the Dark.
That's a really good choice, one of their best live songs ever.
What about you?
Mine is probably Aces High.
One of the best live openers of all time.
Yeah, Aces High is just so memorable because of their live shows.
Is it safe to say that Iron Maiden is one of the best live bands of all time?
Oh totally, their catalogue and stage presence is amazing.
It'd be awesome to see them in South America, the crowds they get there are amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the best rock guitarist?
Jimi hendrix
Really?
Yes. The things he could do are amazing.
I think Jimmy Paige is the best.
He was more of a studio musician.
True
I love the rock sound Jimmy Paige has in his songs.
He does make great melodies.
So does Hendrix.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of rock music right now?
I think the classic stuff is way better. The stuff now is awful.
Yeah, I agree, there's nothing like Bohemian Rhapsody.
I totally agree. I would take some Rolling Stones or ACDC anyday over the current music.
Yeah, although some of the bands from the 90s aren't bad.
True. I used to listen to Slipknot all the time.
They're a little too heavy for me. I prefer some classic Nirvana.
True, nothing can beat Nirvana. It's such a shame Kurt Cobain died so young.
Yeah, I totally agree. The good die young.
Better than turn into Aerosmith! They're terrible now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Rolling Stones!
Who is your favorite member of the band?
I'd have to say that my favorite is Mick Jagger.
He is great. But I think Keith Richards is my favorite member.
Both are incredible. That band has had such a long career!
It is amazing that they are still playing together.
They still sound good too. I saw them recently and they were excellent.
Did Mick dance around the stage?
He strutted around the whole stage just like he did when he was younger. It was amazing!
I'll have to try and see them next time they come to town!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So my parents went to a Pink Floyd concert tonight.
Actual Pink Floyd or a tribute band?
Not sure.  I just know that they'll be home super late.
Pink Floyd is an interesting band for sure.  They sure indulged in some unusual activities.
I already know where you're going with that, but I doubt my parents will be interested.
I'm not knocking them.  I like listening to them in the background while I work on homework.
Really?  I didn't know that.
Yeah.  I like the instrumental stuff.
Sounds like we should have gone tonight instead of kicking around this place.
Not with your parents though.  I'm too cool for that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of the old school prog scene?
Like Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes, all of that?
Yeah, those are good examples of old school, high-concept prog.
I love it - I like the theatrical elements and odd and eclectic compositions
Definitely. I always liked Rush myself, especially the really early stuff like 2112.
Yeah me too. 2112 is a classic. Never felt the synth era though, around Signals.
Yeah the synth era was pretty different from the early stuff - I like guitar-based music in general so I agree with you
If it doesn't have noisy, dissonant guitar noise all over the place, it's not my kinda prog music
Ha, I hear that - I like music like that for the journey and I think dissonance and resolution are big parts of that.
I agree - progressive music is all about trying new things, breaking out of what's been established and moving forward.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Nirvana is the most overrated band ever.
No joke.  I don't know why they were so popular.
They were kind of the first grunge act so they had first rites to it.
The thing about Nirvana is they really don't have many memorable songs.
'Smells Like Teen Spirit' is all I ever hear.
Me too.
I think they were only as popular just because Kurt Cobain committed suicide.
It probably helped them achieve their notoriety.
Had he not killed himself, I think they would have kind of just died out like most acts.
Yeah, I agree with you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So is U2 going to have a new album soon or what?
Not sure.  I keep hearing they will be but nothing ever happens.
The last album was pretty critically-panned.
For good reason.  They threw something out there without really making a good record.
Kind of reminds me what they did with Pop.  That was garbage.
Oh yeah.  Remember Discotheque?
Don't remind me.  What were they thinking?
I guess they were trying too hard to be different.
Just stick with the classics.  Everyone loves Joshua Tree.
That's an album I still listen to.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Avenged Sevenfold?
Yes! They are my all-time favorite band!
What's your favorite song by them?
I'd have to say "Critical Acclaim" and "God Damn". Both are really heavy songs and that's what I like!
Coolness! I am a big fan of them too.
I also love Disturbed!
Oh me too! I love "The Sound of Silence". Best song ever!
Yes and not just that song, everything by Disturbed is awesome!
I'll have to agree with you there.
I think they should've won about 1,000 awards for "The Sound of Silence" though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Metallica?
I like Metallica before the Black Album.
What is your favorite song?
I can't pick just one song but I like to play the entire Master of Puppets album from start to finish.
My favorite song is "The Four Horsemen"
Did you know that Dave Mustaine wrote that before he was kicked out of the band, then used it in his new band Megadeth as "The Mechanix"
Actually it was "The Mechanix" first. Metallica then modified it into "The Four Horsemen" after Dave Mustaine had left.
That's cool! Which one do you like better?
I like "The Four Horsemen" better. The added melodic solo at the end gives it a new flair.
You find Metallica playing "The Mechanix" in the early 80's on Youtube before Dave Mustaine left the band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music?
Oh, yeah. I love it! Do you?
Rock is definitely my favorite genre. Who are some of your favorite bands or singers?
I love Nirvana!
Me too! Offspring would have to be my favorite I think.
I love Offspring!
What's your favorite Offspring song?
I love Smash.
Me too! Not only the album, but the song Smash specifically.
Yeah, me too. I was talking about the song mostly.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see the latest news on Alternative Press?
No I haven't. Is it good news?
Well, not exactly. Do you like Of Mice and Men?
Like them, no. I absolutely LOVE them.
Me too. Sorry to have to be the one to tell you this, but Austin Carlisle has officially left the band.
Oh no! How will this affect the music? Without his voice Of Mice and Men just wont be the same.
He has to focus on his health. The doctors warned him that if he continued at the rate he was going with touring and recording that he could end up paralyzed.
That would be awful. It sounds like it was a decision that had to be made.
Totally. And we know Austin can't completely walk away from the post-hardcore rock music scene.
You're right, he's made for it. I'm excited to hear what he does next, and for what Of Mice and Men do next.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you seen the new Paramore music video?
Hard Times? Oh yeah.
What do you think of it?
I love the 80s style.
I do too. It even gets an A-ha feel at one point.
You mean like from the video for Take on Me?
Exactly. That kind of moving line and illustration.
I can totally see that.
Do you think Hard Times' music video is better than Still Into You's video?
No, I definitely prefer the video for Still Into You.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey what do you think of Bryan Adams?
I'm more indifferent than anything.
Yeah can't say I'm a huge fan, but Summer of 69 is such a nostalgic sort of tune.
I can agree with that, makes up for the overly sappy Everything I do, I do it for you.
Ha yeah that song is incredibly sappy indeed.
Yeah at least Straight From The Heart has a minor edge to it.
Emphasis on minor edge, but agreed.
To be fair even though as I stated I'm largely indifferent, I do here he's good live.
I've heard the same actually, I would go to a show if the cost was right.
Same here, then again I simply enjoy live music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good political band?
Have you heard of the Dead Kennedys?
No. What are they about?
They are a punk band.
Who is the frontman?
His name is Jello Biafra.
What's his deal?
He is crazy but very talented.
Sounds cool. I like political music.
Me too. Check this band out today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like faster or slower rock?
I prefer the fast stuff.
Have you listened to the Hives?
I think so.
Listen to Get Free, it is their best song.
Ok I will do that.
The live version is excellent too.
Ok I like the the live versions of songs.
Then you will enjoy this one.
OK thank you for the recommendation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When did classic rock become stuff from the 80s?
It has been there for a while now.
I don't think Motley Crue is classic rock.
Dude, it's over 30 years old now.
Not to me. It seems like just yesterday they were rocking the world.
You got to face it your old now.
I still don't think of 80s music as classic rock.
So what do you think is classic rock?
I don't know.  Stuff from the 60s and 70s.
You got to face facts, in a couple of years classic rock will be Nickleback and 90s rock.
XXXXXXXXXXX
When do you think Rock music began?
Probably sometime in the 1950s.
What artist or band do you think Rock music originated with?
It would have to be Little Richard.
Do you think Little Richard was better than Elvis?
Elvis and Little Richard were both good, they had a lot in common.
Who do you think were the best Rock bands of the 1960s?
I'd have to say The Who, Rolling Stones, or Cream.
Those were great bands, too bad there aren't any bands like that anymore.
It is too bad, today everything is created by studio engineers instead of by the musicians themselves.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Yo you heard of that band Five Iron Frenzy?
Nope, what songs they got?
How about Every New Day, nice emotional one
Sounds lame
How about one called Cannonball?
What's that one like
Nice rocky one with horns
Not bad, anything else?
O canada is fantastic
I'm freakin sold! Play it for me!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey whats you opinion on Journey?
The rock band?
Yeah.
I think they are awesome and I respect their early work. However I am not  a current fan.
Why not?
I honestly feel the band just wasn't the same without their lead singer Stephen Perry.
What makes you say something like that?
Dude, He has an iconic voice and he was the face of the band when he was lead singer.
I mean I agree somewhat but I think they are still good without him.
I can't agree with you there. I think the band lost an icon in Perry.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listening to rock regularly?
Oh yes all of the time.
Do you like Maroon 5?
Yes but I consider that to be more pop.
I disagree, I think it is rock.
What song do you like by them?
I like the older albums.
Songs about Jane?
Exactly.
You have good taste.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like The Hives?
Is that a rock band?
Yes! They play garage rock music.
Are they from the United States?
No, they're actually from Sweden.
Cool! Do they ever play in the US?
They do! Their live show is amazing. They have so much energy and wear interesting outfits.
What kind of outfits do they wear?
Sometimes they wear tuxedos and look very sharp.
That's a cool way for a band to dress. So sharp!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to listen to rock music ever?
Yes I listen to Heaven's Basement.
I never heard of them?
Really? All of my friends have.
What song do you like?
I like the song Fire, fire.
That sounds kind of interesting.
I suggest you take a listen to it sometime.
I will.
Well nice talking to you!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of rock music do you like?
There are different kinds?
Oh yeah, for sure. It's a really various genre, you know? There's indie rock, classic rock, punk rock, annoying radio rock like Nickelback...
Guess you learn something new every day.
Yeah, you do. So. Answer my question!
I guess I'm into punk.
Good answer, we can stay friends.
I didn't even know that was on the line.
Oh, it is. You're lucky I'm letting punk slide. I'm a huge Metalhead.
Metalocalypse is pretty cool, can't lie.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to Fritz and the Tantrums
Once or twice I think theyve been on
I really think they make some great music
I dont know I havent paid attention to it much.
They have music that can appeal to anyone
So it has a fuller sound?
That and their lyrics are relevant
In what way?
They can be interpreted in so many ways
I guess thats the mark of a great band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Incubus album?
I haven't. Is it any good?
It's okay, but their old stuff will always be king.
Their old stuff is amazing.
I re-listened to some of their older stuff the other stuff. Brought me back.
Like songs off the Science record?
Yes! Such an amazing record.
That music was way ahead of it's time.
I wish they would go to back to that style.
I do as well.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is there anyone cooler than Butch Walker?
That's a random question but probably, yes.
No no, that was rhetorical you weren't supposed to answer.
Oh okay, then no yeah Butch Walker is the coolest.
His latest album Stay Gold has such a coolness factor to it.
You're going to have to explain what that means, man.
Each song drips with this East coast, New Jersey flavor and swagger.
I can see what you mean but plenty of artists do that.
Yeah but how many actually feel authentic?
I guess not many, lots of people try and nail that sound and it comes off disingenuous.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just got a bunch of really good rock the other day.
What did you get?
I was at this thrift store and bought some old floppy disks that had a bunch of music store on dhem.
Wow, that's a score.
Yeah, there were all sorts of classics on there.
Like what songs?
There were all sorts of songs,but a lot of rock classics by bands like Pink Floyd, the Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Doors.
Yeah, I forget how good that stuff is.
Yeah, it never stops being good.
One of my favorites by the Stones was on there, Sympathy for the Devil.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you into rock music?
Totally!
What artist?
Nickelback.
Oh no don't tell me that!
They are good!
They are way to mainstream.
Then who do you like then?
Rolling Stones.
Oh come on, they are way too generic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of The Who?
Love them! One of the best rock bands ever!
I agree a hundred percent!
Roger Daltrys voice is pure rock!
True rock voice. None,better!
Love reign oer me!!
One of my favorite Who songs.
Ever see them live!
Yes. Four times in my life.
Wow,I saw them once.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What you think of Nickleback
I love them
Really?
Yeah, why?
Dude that's such a scum bag steve band
Do you like that song, photographs?
Nope, too whiney.
How about that song How You Remind Me?
OH I LOVE THAT ONE
Ha knew it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
what is your favorite rock band.
Journey. Hands down best band.
Why did they break up?
I heard it was because the lead singer needed to have surgery and they didn't want to wait for him to heal.
I'm sure there was more to it than that.
There always is.
I think him and Neal Schon had a falling out and they didn't want it made public.
Yes there did seem to be a lot of bad blood there.
I don't think it's cool that they keep trying to replace him.
Yes, he was the voice of Journey.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band is your all time favorite?
I have to say the Beach Boys.
They are something!
What's your favorite song by them?
Surfin USA is incredible.
We used to play that in band all the time.
I did too.
It was so fun to rock out to.
Yeah, those were the days.
You bet.
XXXXXXXXXXX
favorite music brand?
Love rock and metal
Favorite band?
Led zeplin
Do you see concerts?
Love them and see a few bands a few times a year.
How long have loved this genre?
My whole life, can't live with out it.
Will you ever be in a band?
Some day and one day i will be in a band cause i love rock music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bob Dylan is probably the greatest songwriter ever.
I don't think there's any debate.
He's pretty much written a good percentage of every classic song.
He's still making some pretty good music.
I haven't heard any of his latest stuff.. So it's pretty good?
Yep, you'll never have another classic, but it's quality stuff.
How's his voice sound?
You can tell he's getting old.  His voice flutters a bit.
Guess that's bound to happen when you're pushing 80 years old.
But at least he's still out there doing it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Bon Jovi?
Of course I like Bon Jovi! He's one of my favorite artists of all time!
I wouldn't go that far, but I think he's one of my favorite rock artists of the eighties at the very least.
That's fair enough, but Living on a Prayer was so iconic!
I think that was his best song.
Do you think so? I liked Shot Through the Heart.
I'd forgotten about that one. They used to play that at dances in high school, right?
I think so sometimes.
How do you even dance to rock music?
You bang your head up and down!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I really hope The Gaslight Anthem get back together, I need to see them live again.
Oh definitely, there's something missing without that Jersey sound in the Summer months.
What have you been listening to to fill the gap?
Going back to old favorites like The Bouncing Souls mostly.
Have you ever listened to AM Taxi?
No I haven't, are they good?
They're very reminiscent of The Gaslight Anthem, gravely voice, catchy guitar hooks.
Oh wow I will have to check them out, where are they from?
They're based in Chicago.
Jersey Shore punk rock based in Chicago, I can dig it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Favorite rock band of all time?
Tough one. I would have to go with Nirvana.
Would you consider that rock? I was thinking that was more grunge.
I think grunge is subset of rock. Teen Spirit totally speaks to me.
Yeah, they are pretty good. I like Pearl Jam too.
I know they would be mortified but I kind of think of them as the same time period. Very similar.
They are but very different in their own right.
Yeah, same thing with Sound Garden and Radiohead.
Oh, I hadn't thought about them
Yeah too many good ones. I would be lost without my music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you remember the REM days?
Oh man you are taking me back. I remember people cutting school to try catch them at the Globe in Athens.
I remember the rumors. It must have been a crazy time to be in Athens. There were so many great bands coming out of that area.
Yeah, the early 80's ...we were begging for rides to get there.
I had friends that had older siblings in school then so they got to go and sneak in to catch the bands.
Yeah, those were days. Things were much more lax then. It must have been great.
Murmur to Document was the high time. That music was great.
I agree. The later stuff had one or two songs but those early albums were all good.
Yep, couldn't touch you play them straight through.
There were some good songs later, but those first albums...amazing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I have a confession: I like Creed.
I don't think we can be friends anymore.
Hear me out.  They were huge in the 90's, right?
Sure.
Well, I grew up in the 90's and everyone liked them so why would I change?
Probably because it's just not cool to like Creed anymore.
Their lead singer went crazy and they stopped making music, but they had some good tunes.
I hope you're not talking about 'With Arms Wide Open'.
That song was awesome!
Yep, we're no longer friends.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the band Praxis?
No I haven't. What are they link?
They are an awesome progressive rock band.
Is anyone I know in it?
Have you ever listened to Buckethead?
Yes! He is so cool!
He is in that band. You will love them.
I will check it out. What should I listen to?
Check out the album Metatron.
I love that name! I will check this out!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was thinking about rock bands from the 80's today. Were you ever a Rush fan?
Are you kidding? That was my favorite band in high school.
That's what I was thinking. I liked their musicianship, but now that I'm older I realize that their lyrics were awesome.
Freewill was way ahead of its time.
Yeah, Red Barchetta was kind of corny, but they made it work. I still think about the lyrics.
I haven't heard anything about them in a while. They've got to be pretty old now.
Geddy Lee turns 64 this July. But they still jam.
Haven't they been doing that "Time Machine" tour for a while?
I heard something about it like 10 years ago.
I think they did their last tour last year, if I'm not mistaken.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you have any favorite rock albums?
I actually just found a new favorite very recently.
Oh really? Which one?
It's the self-titled album by Avenged Sevenfold.
I don't think I've heard of them.
Well, they're a hard rock/heavy metal type of band based out of Southern California.
So they play both styles?
Kind of. Their self-titled album is a great mix of both, and that's why I like it.
Okay, now I understand.
You should definitely give them a listen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
ERIC Clapton is the best rock,guitarist ever.
You know,I have to agree.
Loved the stuff cream did. Classic rock.
They were great. Ginger baker was the best drummer out their in my opinion.
I agree but Keith moon was no slouch.
No,he was just a mess.
That he was. To bad that happens to a lot of rockers.
It is a shame.
Clapton solo career has been outstanding!!
He's had a lot of solo hits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Rock?
Oh yeah I am listening currently to Sheer Mag.
They are amazing! What song are you listening to?
I am hearing currently Need to Feel Your Love.
Have not heard that yet.
You have to hear it.
What else do you like?
Nickelback.
They are so old.
I know but I love the song far away.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you know many bands from Seattle?
Quite a few actually. What kind of music are you interested in?
Rock music! I love vintage rock music.
In that case, you would probably love bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam.
All of those bands are from Seattle?
They sure are. They were part of the grunge scene.
That's amazing. And they all rose to fame around the same time?
Correct. All of these bands had a lot of success and radio play.
I know Nirvana well, but I'll have to learn more and listen to Soundgarden and Pearl Jam.
Black Hole Sun is my favorite Soundgarden song. You should check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite classic rock band?
I would probably say it was Led Zeppelin.
They were really great and made great music.
Yeah my favorite song from them is Black Dog. Great song. Mine is Mist Mountain Hop.
Wouldn't it be great if they played a final concert?
Sure except that John Bonham is dead.
True but his son Jason plays the drums and could sit in his place.
That would be a pretty amazing concert to see.
It sure would be a packed stadium for sure.
I hope it happens one day soon.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite bands in the seventies was Lynryd Skynryd.
Oh mine too! They were great!
Remember Ronnie Van Zant? He always wore that cowboy hat.
Yea they were a great southern rock band.
Sweet Home Alabama was one of my favorite songs.
And Freebird is a classic!!
It is awful that he was killed in the plane crash.
Several of the original band members are gone now.
I know, but their music will live on.
That is true. Lets go listen to the radio, maybe we will hear them.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I swear Tool is the best band ever.
They are very good.
I always go back to listen to them and I'm always surprised.
The whole band is talented.
Yeah even their bass-lines are amazing.
Maynard has a crazy voice too.
He does. Their music videos used to scare me when I was little.
They were a little creepy.
I'm surprised that more people don't try to copy their sound.
I think they're so good, it would be hard to match.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I want to get started on gothic rock music but I do not know where to start.
Siouxsie and the Banshees is a classic!
Oh, I know a song by them. Kiss Them for Me.
Yeah, that is a popular one. You should also try Spellbound.
Okay, I will. What is another good band?
On the rock side of gothic music, you need to know The Cure.
I have some songs by them, too.
Good! Robert Smith and Siouxsie Sioux are gothic icons.
I love their personal styles.
It would be cool if they did a collaboration.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do rock bands always get kind of lame when they have been together for decades?
Not always, haven't you been following Swans?
Not since The Seer. Are they an old band?
Yeah, Swans has been around since the 80s and their style keeps evolving.
Have you heard their most recent albums?
I actually have not heard their most recent one, The Glowing Man, but To Be Kind was good.
They remind me of Tool, if Tool actually released new music on a regular basis.
Well, Tool is a different kind of band. Their songwriting is more methodical.
How methodical?
Compared to Swans, what Tool does is precise, deliberate, and mathematical.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was one of your favorite rock bands?
Ted Nugent was great, I loved his songs.
Me too, I like the song Cat Scratch Fever, what song did you like?
Stranglehold was the best, it had a good beat.
Yes and I loved his long hair and mustache.
Where was he from anyway?
I think he was from Detroit.
I never knew that. Have you been to his concert?
No, but it would have been nice.
I wonder what he's doing now.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, any bands you looking to see this Summer?
I don't know man, but I'm really dying to see Metallica. I heard they're gonna be in concert in Orlando.
Really man? What date are they going to play?
July 5th, I was thinking about ordering tickets on Stubhub.
Dude, I am so down to go, but I don't have money for a ticket.
That's alright man, I can buy you a ticket when I order mine, just pay me back when you get paid.
For real man? You're the best, this show is going to be awesome!
Hell yeah man, I can't wait to see them perform Master of Puppets live.
Dude, I hope they play Ride the Lightning. That's my favorite song.
Another great song too man, I am so hyped for this!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who are some of your favorite underrated bands?
Oh man, King's X without a doubt. They are criminally underrated.
King's X? What do they sound like?
Their sound varies. Their early stuff from the '80s is melodic but influenced by heavy metal and blues. My favorite song from this era is "Over My Head." Such a great song.
Hmm, not really into that sound.
Well, throughout the '90s, they were heavily influenced by grunge. Pearl Jam were a big fan of them during this era. But they still kept their flair for melody, harmony, and groove, which can be heard throughout all of their albums.
Melody and harmony?
Yeah, all of the members of the band sing, and they create complex vocal harmonies. They were very influenced by the Beatles in this regard.
Whoa, now that sounds intriguing. I'll have to look into them.
Their most recent stuff has become very progressive and heavier. I like each era, but they've never quite achieved mainstream success, but they have a very loyal fanbase.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey do you remember The New Kids on the Block.
Yea, ha ha. My daughter loved them!
Oh mine too.  What was that hit of theirs?
They had many but I think you mean The Right Stuff.
That was it. Yea I remember a few more, Step by Step and Hanging Tough.
I hear they are on tour again. All grown up now.
I heard that. My daughter told me.
Well that is one band I do not want to spend my money on.
Neither do I!
I guess they are a good teeny bopper band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the band Blue October?
No, what genre is it?
They are an alternative rock band
Oh, I love Alt rock. What songs do they sing
You might know their song Hate Me
Oh I know that song! It has such deep lyrics, I love it
Yeah, it's about the lead singer, Justin Furstenfeld's, drug problem
Are all of them deep?
No, their song Calling You is pretty fun and light hearted
i'll have to check it out
XXXXXXXXXXX
Remember Guns and Roses?
Yes I do. Axel Rose was a very good singer.
Slash played guitar and did very good too.
Yes Welcome to the Jungle was my favorite song, how about you?
Sweet Child O' Mine was my favorite, but I liked them all.
Too bad they all broke up.
I know that was really stupid.
Think of all the music they could of made.
We sure are missing out on that.
Yeah, they were great and could of gave us so much more.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock band of all time?
Its hard to say but I'm going way back in time and I would say the Doors!
Not bad! I thought you was going to say Pearl Jam!
Haha! heck no man they might be the worst rock band of all time!
Just playing with ya! So whats your favorite Doors song?
Thats a no brainer it's Alabama Song but some know it as Whisky Bar.
Thats song is trippy! Great Pick!
Show me the way to the next whiskey bar! Whats your favorite rock band and song?
i would have to say Metallica and Enter Sandman!
Thats a great pick that video was sweet too! Old creepy man eating potatoes..
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of Tom petty
I love tom petty
I do too. He rocks
Yes he does.
He's and,old time rocker. Been around for awhile.
He has. Didn't he go out with Stevie Nick's
Yes,back in the eighties I think.
They weren't together that long.
She's a rocker too.
Yes she is. I love her voice
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a Guns n Roses fan?
Of course! Well, the classic stuff anyway.
Like 'Appetite for Destruction'?
Yes! Iconic album. So many great songs.
Looking at it now, it's like a greatest hits. So many songs became big.
They didn't even release that many singles from that album either, did they?
No - the album itself just got so popular all the songs on it became huge.
Crazy to think what happened to Axl Rose when you look at him in the 90s.
I know, right? A great vocalist with such stage presence, and now he isn't doing anything.
A real shame. They were a hell of a live band in their prime.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Whagt did you think about Coldplay's last album?
Is Coldplay really rock?
What do you mean by that?  Of course they are.
Well, they've just had a lot of electronic stuff lately.
True, but Parachutes and their earlier stuff was all rock for sure.
It's kind of hard to believe that they've been around for 20 years.
They've had good staying power.  It helps that they've crafted good music during that time.
They've also reinvented themselves too.
I think they're retiring, aren't they?
I doubt it.  They'll be back.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite 80s rock band?
Motley Crue was my favorite rock band from the 80s.
Which album did you like the most?
I liked the girls, girls, girls album the best.
Do you have any favorite songs from it?
I like "Wild Side"
You didn't like the earlier music.
Oh yes, I like many songs.
I like the song "Live Wire".
Many songs have a lot of energy which is what I like.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock band from the 80's?
I'd have to say Van Halen.
Oh I love them and also Duran Duran.
Yeah they really defined the 80s. My kids love 80's rock music as well as 90s.
Do they know about the Cranberries?
Zombie is their favorite song. They love the chorus, just like everyone else.
That's great that you've introduced them to the classics.
Thanks, I feel like that's essential. Today's music is awful.
I totally agree with that. Were you into any of the hair bands?
That's the one genre of rock I purposely skipped without regret.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The radio is giving away red hot chille peppers tickets
what are the tickets for and how many are they giving away.
they are coming to Dallas Tx next week and the radio has 2 front row seats.
great i love them guys.
i am going to call them every second.
okay i will help you call them, do you have a extra phone?
use your cell phone. i just have one phone.
i don't own a phone i haven't had a phone since 2006
what kind of person doesn't carry a cell phone in 2017, here is some quarters go to pay phone.
so whats the number to the radio station?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of Metallica?
Yes, I use to listen to it alot.
I went to one of their concerts.
I never got that chance.
It is more heavy metal than rock.
I agree, although they do have rock songs.
Yeah I like some of the slow songs.
Their album Master of Muppets is my favorite.
I like that one but wasn't that the third album they released?
Yeah, it was released back in 1986.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What style of rock music is your favorite?
That's a tough question. There I days when I most want to listen to 90s alternative rock and days when I prefer softer, more current rock.
I can understand that. Different days you have different moods and might want to listen to something different.
Exactly. Lately I have been listening to a good amount of Goo Goo Dolls.
Oh, really? They are one of my favorites. I listened to their album Dizzy Up the Girl so many times through.
That's a good album. Do you also like Counting Crows?
Absolutely. Mr. Jones is a song I grew up with.
Me too. My parents let me pick the music that I listened to so I heard a lot of Goo Goo Dolls, Matchbox 20, Counting Crows and that style growing up.
Oh, I saw Matchbox 20 last year in concert. They played several songs from the album Yourself or Something Like You.
Awesome, I'm sure that was a great show.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of music do you like?
I tend to listen to classic rock and oldies most of the time.
Really, what bands do you like?
I really enjoy CCR.
I have never heard of them. What do the sing.
Maybe you know there full name. Credence Clearwater Revival. They had dozens of hits back in the day. Run Through the Jungle, Fortunate Son, I Put a Spell on You, to name a few.
Oh, I know a few of those. Are they still playing.
No, they broke up a long time ago, but the lead Singer, John Fogerty still tours.
I have heard of him. Didn't he have some solo stuff.
Yes, He had a couple of hits in the 80s and another in the late 90s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hey.
Do you listen to rock music a lot?
Well I don't know about a lot, but I enjoy it.
How do you normally listen to it?
I usually stream it on my computer.
Oh through apps and stuff?
Yeah I usually use pandora.
Oh okay cool.
Also Spotify.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Black Flag album
I haven't heard it yet.
We'll save yourself the trouble.
Is it really that bad?
It's awful and can't remotely compare to their classic albums.
Sadly not surprised, given how long they were inactive
Me either, though I did see them live and that was still fun.
I bet due to their older tunes, speaking of which what's your favorite?
Wow that's a tough one, but also been partial towards Nervous Breakdown if forced to choose.
Great choice, but I like Rise Above best.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of Rock music do you like?
I like Classic Rock
Give me some examples of who you listen to?
I listen to LEd Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, bands like that.
So you like the harder rock?
It was hard then, but it is nothing compared to hard rock these days.
That's true. Have you heard Five Finger Death Punch?
Yes, but I think that is more Metal than hard rock?
What about their cover of Bad Company?
I like it, it was a lot more intense than the original, but it was still good.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What era of music do you like best?
I love the 50's and 60's they had the best songs back then.
Yeah, I like what they call jukebox music. I remember spending many quarters playing Diana Ross songs.
Oh yeah, you almost knew who was in the room by the songs that were playing. My favorites were from the "Beach Boys".
Those songs were fun. They made me want to move to California and buy a surf board.
I also liked "The Mamas and the Papas" and how about "Chubby Checker"?
Let's do the twist. You weren't cool if you did not know how to twist.
Oh, I remember a great one,"When A Man Loves A Woman" by Percy Sledge.
I wonder how many movies that one has been in.
It was a great song for the movies it is so romantic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you listened to any good rock bands lately?
I've been listening to Nickelback.
They're one of my favorite bands. Chad Kroeger is a good singer.
He is. Did you know he collaborated with Carlos Santana?
I didn't know that. When did they work together?
Back in 2007, the name of the song was Into the Night?
That's awesome! Has Chad Kroeger worked with any other artists?
He worked with Josey Scott on the song Hero.
Isn't Josey Scott in the band Saliva?
Yes, he's the lead singer of Saliva.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You like Led Zeppelin music?
Love Zeppelin!! Great rock band.
To bad Robert plant won't tour with the band anymore.
I'm thinking he can't hit those notes anymore.
You could be right.
He said no to playing at Coachella with all the,old time rockers.
Yea,turned down millions I guess.
Would have been cool.
Would have been great hearing stairway to heaven again.
My favorite Zeppelin song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you listen to any Matchbox 20?
I like their lead singer.
Yes Rob Thomas is great.
I like his voice a lot.
Yes the whole band is so great.
I want to listen to them right now.
Go ahead, they are so great.
Ok thank you for the recommendation.
They can play fast and slow, they are a great band
Ok I will look out for their tracks, thanks again.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Tame Impala is really changing the game
You think?
Yeah, they're the first people to really do psychadellic rock right since the 60's
Yikes, that's a harsh accusation.
I'm serious! Sure, there's Jake Bugg and Mac Demarco, but you can't really trip to them.
Yeah, I guess they're more of a vibe.
Right? So, Tame Impala is doing it.
I'm hoping it'll open the door to more psych music.
Me too, my man. Childish Gambino's latest album shows that it will.
You're right! It was crazy to hear him make a rock album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
PUP has been one of the most surprising new bands for me.
Yeah they're really explosive.
I saw them live in New York City last week and holy cow they rock.
Did they play their song DVP?
You bet they did, being part of the crowd for DVP was legendary.
I'll have to get out to one of their shows.
You absolutely must, I will even grab a ticket for you if they play nearby.
Thanks a lot man I really appreciate it.
I love the brand of rock that SideOneDummy continues to sign onto their label.
Truly one of the most consistent labels around.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I like Peter Gabriel too.
Wasn't he in another rock band?
He was in Genesis.
That's right. He and Phil Collins were in Genesis.
Sledgehammer was a really creative video.
That came out when MTV first started.
Sledgehammer was on Peter Gabriel's "So" album.
Funny how albums are in the dust bin of history now.
Well that album should definitely live on in the rock genre.
"So" came out in 1985.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like those top ten lists that people do?
It depends on that they are ranking...
I was looking at one for best frontmen of rock groups- guess who was number one?
Probably Prince... or Chris Cornell from Soundgarden.... or Michael Hutchence from INXS.
Nope, number one was Freddie Mercury from Queen, then Robert Plant and Mick Jagger.
Mick Jagger was rated higher than Prince or Chris Cornell?  They must not have been judging by their vocals.
I just looked it up on my cell phone. Prince was ranked 51. Hutchence was 53, and Cornell was 24.
You're kidding. So who was ranked at the bottom?
Number 100 was Syd Barret from Pink Floyd. Apparently even creepy Marilyn Manson was better than Pink Floyd since he came in number 88.
Now you see why I don't pay attention to those kinds of things. Everyone knows the lead singer of Pink Floyd was better than Marilyn Manson.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you at all a fan of Metallica's self-titled album?
That's the one they call the black album, right?
That's the one. I've been told that a lot of metal fans don't like it much.
That's understandable, considering that the band went from thrash metal to more straightforward hard rock on the album.
So you don't like it?
Actually, I do. I respect Metallica for taking such a bold risk.
That was unexpected. Do you like all of their more rock-oriented albums?
Honestly, I am. Like I said, I appreciated them for the risks that they took.
But what's your opinion on the music itself?
I really like it. Can't go wrong with a little variety.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you ever a fan of Creed?
Not really.  Why?
I just started listening to them again.  I really like their sound.
I never really was into them.  Didn't the lead singer go solo or something?
I'm not sure, but he did go into another band.
What was the name of it?
Art of Anarchy, i think.
Oh, do you like them too?
Yeah, but I'm a fan of Scott Stapp anyway.
I don't think I'd like it.  I never really cared for his voice.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love rock music!  I would love to live in a little pink house by John Mellencamp.
That would be very cool but what would the interior have?
I think I would have "a magic carpet ride" by Steppenwolf.
Magic carpet inside would be insane.  I wonder where this would be?
If I had my choice it would be "standing on the corner of Winslow Arizona" taking it easy by the Eagles.
Arizona is cool and I would live there.  Who are you living with?
I am living with "Jack and Diane".  They are performed by John Cougar Mellencamp.
Jack and Diane, no way.  I bet they are crazy people!
They are "born to be wild".  They get their motor running by steppenwolf.
For sure they are wild.  Very cool rock n roll conversation.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Rilo Kiley is one of the best indie rock bands of all time
Really?
Oh, hell yeah! jenny lewis is just a better, hotter taylor swift
what a weird comparison
i guess, but here me out. she wrote a bunch of break up songs about her ex...and her ex is in the band!
okay yeah, that's a whole new layer of petty
it is! listen to silver lining, it's great
i'll listen to it ASAP
nah, listen right now. i'm going to put it on.
wow. you don't mess around when it comes to rilo kiley
XXXXXXXXXXX
Any good new bands out there?
I've been listening to a band called the I Don't Cares recently, they're pretty cool.
That's a good name, I've not heard of the.
It's actually a collaboration between Paul Westerberg and Juliana Hatfield.
I know who Juliana Hatfield is but I forgot who Paul Westerbeg was.
He was the lead singer and guitarist for The Replacements, then he made a few solo albums after that.
Oh Okay, I remember him. I really used to like his music but haven't heard any of his in several years.
He's still great. He's a very underrated songwriter I think.
What's the best song by The I don't Cares?
My personal favorite off of their album in a song titled King of America. It's really a good song, you should check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever hear of an old guy called Bob Seger?
Yeah.  Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band.
Yeah.  That's why I was thinking of.
Why do you ask?
I never realized it, but he was the guy that sang Against the Wind.
I think I remember that song being in Forrest Gump when he was running or something.
Something like that.  Turns out he's got quite a few notable songs.
I think he also sang Night Moves.
Okay, I recognize that one too.
He's got more hits than you might think.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I've been a fan of rock music since the 1960's.
What were your favorite groups from back then?
The Rolling Stones and Cream were my favorites.
Cream had some good albums, but their live album "Wheels of Fire" was recorded terribly.
Yeah, live recording technology has come along way!
Did you like southern rock?
Yes, The Allman  Brothers were fantastic. They had a tragic history.
For sure. Duane Allman  and Berry Oakley died within a year of each other---both by motorcycle accidents.
Rock music has changed so much over the years. I wouldn't classify today's rock music as rock---most of it is pop.
Yes, I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you like Rock music?
Yeah sure.
What kind of rock do you like?
All kinds.  I guess maybe blues and jam bands.
Oh okay cool.
They are my favorite.
Do you like seeing live music.
Yeah definitely.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I never understood Speed Metal.
I don't either.
I do like heavy metal bands though.
Who do you like?
Metallica has some really great tunes.
They always put out good stuff like "Turn The Page".
Hey, the Bob Seger cover! Seger can belt it out too.
Bob Seger is a little before my time.
Well stick with listening to Metallica.
Just so long as it isn't speed metal I'm all for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Godsmack. They still around?
You know what. I'm not sure.
I must not be the only one to not know. Last hit I remember was years ago.
Some time around 2010. Good Day to Die is the last one I remember.
Same here. Last one I remember also.
They are a band I miss. They had some great music.
Their slower, spiritual songs seemed to be their best hits. Although, I liked their more heavy stuff as well.
Definitely. Voodoo and Serenity were their greatest hits. Almost spiritual feeling you get when you listen to those songs.
Yes. Something about the beat to the songs.
You are making me nostalgic and taking me back to the early 2000s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to Japanese rock music?
A little. I like X-Japan.
I love that band, and Yoshiki especially.
He is a good drummer and his English is amazing.
I also like that Sugizo is a member now.
What band was he in before?
He was in Luna Sea.
His electric violin adds a lot to the band.
Have you seen the documentary "We are X"?
Not yet, but my friend was at one of the concerts they filmed.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I don't get what distinguishes heavy metal from hard rock.
You serious?
Yeah, I mean. They're both rock music, and they're both loud.
Okay, here's the main difference: the blues.
The blues?
Rock and roll is built on the blues, right? Hard rock, by extension, is heavily blues-based.
Okay, I'm listening.
Heavy metal, though -- its (very white) innovation is to take all the swing, all the blues out of hard rock.
How did they do that?
Look at the rhythm; there's no swing to it anymore. It's all mechanical, all square.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Foo Fighters single?
No! I didn't know they had a new song. What's it called?
The song is called "Run" and the video is really great.
How so?
Dave Grohl directed it, and he's really very funny.
Wasn't Dave Grohl in Nirvana as well?
That's correct, he was the drummer.
Were you a big Nirvana fan?
Yes, they really changed rock music.
I agree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival?
Yeah, I love them!
It's so easy to put on one of their albums and lose track of time.
Exactly. They make a good soundtrack for just about anything.
I love all kinds of loud southern rock bands.
Me too. Do you like Lynyrd Skynyrd?
Of course I do!
Everyone loves Freebird.
It's a great song.
Definitely. It's a classic.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock band?
I like older punk music , like Richard Hell and the Voidoids.
I like older punk as well but also newer stuff.
When I think "newer" I think of the 90's punk
I guess its not that new any more.
I liked a few from that era as well
Like who?
Bands like Screeching Weasel and the Queers
I really liked them too
But you cant beat the originals
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love the Monkees! They are my favorite rock music band!
They are not really a band!
What do you mean? They have several hit songs in the rock music genre.
They were put together just for the television show.
Perhaps, but they still appeared on the rock music charts.
It was all manufactured! You should like some real rock music instead.
Like who?
You should listen to the Rolling Stones, The Beatles, or even The Kinks. They were put together naturally.
What do you mean by natural?
They grew up together as friends. They had a common dream -- to be rock music stars.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite rock group?
Rolling stones. they are awesome and still going!
I will say that is great to see them still rocking it.
Keith Richards has so much stamina still.
I am surprised he has not had a drug overdose and died yet.
It is a little awe inspiring, that he lived so hard and still working.
Drugs were so much a part of the rock and world scene.
I think they still are part of that world and lifestyle.
To some degree but back in their hayday it was so present in the rock culture.
I think it is just a little more hushed up now, but still very much there in the music rock scene.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Random question, greatest rock guitarist in history?
Jimi Hendrix.
Meh.
You don't like Hendrix. He pretty much started the rock guitar solo.
Granted. He was a good guitar player. Maybe I'll give you that one but he wasn't much of a performer.
So who are you thinking of?
Eddie Van Halen. Eric Clapton.
Clapton is good. Possibly one of the best ever but he learned everything he knows from Hendrix.
And Van Halen?
Learned everything he knows from Clapton. HA!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were the Ramones and The Clash big at your school?
Yeah, there were a few kids really in to them. Most of the people I knew were more in to U2, REM, The Alarm.
Yeah, those bands are good too. I was in to them too. I even liked a little B-52s.
I totally forgot about them. Talk about a blast from the past.
Yeah it was either those kind of alternative bands or classic rock bands...I remember there was Eagles resurgence.
Eeew, really? Hair bands were big...think Bon Jovi.
Yuck, I've never been a fan. I can't deal with guys that use more hairspray than I do.
Ha! True. I guess I've always kind of like the alternative groups. I was into Nirvana and Pearl Jam when they made it to east coast.
Yeah, me too. We've grown up with some really great music.
Yeah, I can't stomach some of this new stuff. Guess I'm getting old.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi there.
Hello.
Do you like seeing live rock music?
Yeah I love live music.
Cool same here.
What is it about live music that you like?
I love the feeling of the crowd and how carried away you can get.
Yeah I feel sort of the same way.  Like you forget about all your problems for a while.
Exactly.
Cool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what, for you, is the best decade for rock music?
Well, it's a hard question, because so much has been out there... but I probably say the 1970s.
The '70s? Really?
Yeah, well, people tend to think of it in terms of disco and some of the cliche classic rock bands, but a lot of cool stuff was going on.
Well, if your broaden your scale to include Germany, you get their experimental rock scene and the birth of electronic music.
Not necessarily the "birth," I'd take issue with that, but yes, techno music as we know it, electronic dance music, for sure.
You have Giorgio Moroder doing that stuff with Sparks by the end of the decade. That's a great album.
Oh yeah, and that's my point, because if you look at rock music in 1970, it's all a bit sludgy and turgid blues-rock.
Sure, and then progressive rock and punk rock came along to wake up everyone.
Yeah, the 1970s are a story of artistic revitalization and rebirth, and that's what appeals to me about them so strongly!
XXXXXXXXXXX
If you were going to make a list of songs for an "Evolution of Rock Music" playlist what would you choose?
Well, first I'd choose something by Elvis Presley.
Like "Hound Dog"?
Right, or "Devil In Disguise".
What next?
Then I think I'd choose something from the Rolling Stones.
Like "Paint It Black"?
Yeah, maybe.
And then who would you choose next?
"Rock and Roll" by Led Zeppelin seems like a good choice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just watched Love & Mercy
That movie on the Beach Boys?
Yeah.
Who was in that?
John Cusack.
Who did he play?
Brian Willson.
Was it any good.
I really liked it.
I'll have to check it out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Bon Scott or Brian Johnson, who's your guy?
Has to be Brian Johnson. His voice is the best.
Yeah, but my favorite AC/DC song is It's a Long Way to the Top so I'm going with Bon Scott.
What happened to that guy anyway?
He vomited while sleeping and choked to death.
Dude, that is tragic.
I know, it's an absolute shame how many Rock artists have died from drinking and drug related deaths.
Brian Johnson was obviously the band's saving grace.
How did Angus Young come up with that little hop he does on stage?
Beats me, but he's been performing like that for 40 plus years now. It's awesome.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you ever listening to rock?
Yes all of the time.
What artist?
I still really like Elvis.
That is so old though!
I know but he is so classic. I love rubberneckin'.
Oh that is a catchy song.
I love the remix to that too.
Same! It was great in the Game Plan.
Oh yeah I remember that!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Can you grab my phone for me and see who is calling me I am getting dressed for the dance club tonight.
What dance club are you going to and what group is going to be there?
I am not exactly sure yet i am waiting for my girl friend to get back to me but i know it is a Rock group.
Wow I like rock remember the old song from way back in the seventies I love Rock and Roll.
Yes I remember them it was the group called AC/DC but that one is not from the seventies i don't think so.
There have been many of numerous different groups with other Artists singing that same Rock and Roll song.
Joan jet I she came out with a lyrics and Britney Spears her too.
Cool I don't think i have ever heard those two where can i find those i want to hear what they sound like.
I guess you can try listening to the radio on the Rock stations and also maybe go check out You tube.
Thanks what time are you leaving that wasn't your'e friend on the phone it was marketing calls well when you do go enjoy the dance club and let me know who was there performing.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about Guns N' Roses touring again?
I love it. I'm a huge fan of Axl.
I'm surprised they got back together.
They had so much baggage I'm pretty shocked as well.
Did you see where they were playing their first venue?
Yes. The new arena in Vegas.
I really wish I could have gotten tickets..
Me too. I'd love to hear Paradise City live one more time.
Maybe they're going to schedule more dates.
I hope so. Them and AC/DC are my favorites.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what are you listening to these days?
Music from the 1990's which was my younger days.
Why is that?
We have lost a lot of talent from the 90's and I'm just missing them.
Like who?
Well the world just lost Chris Cornell.  He was lead singer for Soundgarden and Audioslave.
Oh ok! I remember that weird video for Black Hole Sun.
It was a bit odd but it is an awesome song. Have you listened to any other music of theirs?
No, do you recommend anything?
Yes, buy Soundgarden's cds "Badmotorfinger", "Superunknown", and "Down On The Upside".  You will hear some awesome music!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music at all?
Yes it is my favorite.
What artist?
Tom Petty. I just love his greatest hits album.
What song though?
I like Breakdown and American Girl.
Those are great songs.
I saw him in concert once.
Oh my goodness that is amazing!
It was the experience of a lifetime. He is so talented.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you know  Dave Grohl played for Nirvana?
Nuh uh!
Yeah.
But Cobain was there guitarist.
And  Dave Grohl was their drummer.
From drummer to front man?!
Yup. Cobain taught him the guitar.
That is too cool.
I love both bands.
I'm no big on Foo Fighters.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of today's rock music?
Not much of anything new I like.
Me either. Give the old rock bands,stones,The Who,Led Zeppelin etc.
The Who and stones still touring and rocking big time.
They are both ageless.
Would love some new,stuff from these bands but I don't see it happening.
Creative days are mostly passed.
Once in awhile a new,song.
Yea,but few and far between.
You are so right
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard that U2 is on tour this summer.
U2?! Are they still around.
Of course they are. Still rockin' after 35-40 years.
That's amazing. I would love to see a U2 concert again. It's been a while.
Yeah, I once saw them live in the '80s.
It's been almost that long for me too. Where are they playing?
MetLife Stadium in NJ on June 28.
I'm sure it's sold out.
I don't know. Ticketmaster is still advertising it.
Maybe I'll check it out. I'd love to get my hands on some U2 tickets.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like listening to Tool?
Yes I like their lyrics.
They have some of the best lyrics.
I couldn't agree more.
It is really worth reading their lyrics.
They are so good, I have never done that, I only listen.
Their songs mean more to me once I know every word.
OK thank you for the recommendation.
Are you going to read their lyrics.
Yes I am, I am looking forward to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
In all honesty, do you think there's a definitive best rock band?
Who knows? In my opinion, it could come down to three options and no closer than that.
Which three?
Queen, the Beatles, and AC/DC.
Those are great choices, actually.
Right? Just think about it.
The Beatles are obviously one of the greatest music groups in history.
Then there's Queen, who helped bring rock music to the mainstream.
And AC/DC gave it the edge that spawned hard rock.
See? That's why it couldn't go any further.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you hear there was a new music video released from Chris Cornell from Soundgarden?
No, where did that come from?
It's for the song "The Promise" and was filmed before he died in May.
Why did they wait until now to release it?
He wanted it released on the same day as World Refugee Day, which was Tuesday.
Where did they film it?
It was filmed in Brooklyn, New York.
I didn't know he was that passionate about refugees.
He toured refugee camps with his family, and the family foundation was trying to help refugee children.
It's a shame he's gone, he obviously cared a lot about people, and a lot of people cared about him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Man the late seventies sucked; it was all Disco Music all the time.
That's not true, there were some good rock albums released in the late seventies.
Such as?
Well let me see, there was Queen's "News of the World" for instance
Is that the one that has "We will rock you" and "We are the champions"?
Yes, in fact those are the first two tracks of the album.
Any other good songs in the album?
The whole album is good you should listen to it.
Didn't "Rumours" came that same year?
That's right! I told you, there was great music back then not just disco.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock band of all time?
Like if I only had to listen to one rock band for the rest of my life?
Yea.
Probably Weezer.
Ahh, good choice.
Yea. I mean I've been listening to their music for like the past 15 years at least, and I still don't get tired of them.
Their songs are so good. Especially the early stuff from their Blue album.
I know right?! Say It Ain't So and Buddy Holly are my favorites from that album.
They're so catchy. I only wish that their later albums were as good.
Yea, the other albums were kind of hit or miss. There were a few good songs from every album, but I loved every single song from the Blue Album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to classic rock?
Sometimes. I really like The Doors.
How about the Rolling Stones?
Oh yeah! Aren't they still touring and stuff?
Yeah, they're still going strong!
That must make them one of the longest running bands in rock history.
Oh, I'm sure. I hope they keep going for a long time to come.
Same here.
If they ever put on a concert here, we should go see them.
That would be awesome!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is your favorite glam rock band.
Queen, for sure.
That Mercury could sure sing.
He died way to soon.
It was really sad.
My kids are really into Queen.
For real.
Yeah, they have good taste.
Like their old man!
Who you calling old?!
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what's the best concert you've been to?
I've been to a lot, but hands down, The Rolling Stones was the best.
It's really hard to believe those guys are still touring now in their 70s.
I saw them about 20 years ago when they were in their 50s, and they had the energy of 30 year olds.
They are one of those "timeless" rock bands, that you can imagine their music being played long after they're gone.
Oh, I know, like Wild Horses- wild horses, couldn't drag me awayyyy.
Everyone made such a big deal over the Beatles, but I always liked The Rolling Stones better.
The Beatles only lasted a decade, but The Stones have evolved over decades and had a much longer career.
I'm amazed Keith Richards has lasted so long considering what a bad boy he was.
That's one of the things I love about the Stones though, is how the band members have stuck together.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever listen to Queen?
I have a couple of their albums.
They are touring right now with Adam Lambert.
It's not the same without Freddy Mercury
I agree. He was a great rock singer
I love We Are the Champions.
That is good and so is Bohemian Rhapsody.
That is their best song ever.
Do you want to go to their concert?
I guess. It is still good rock music after all.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you notice that Green Day wasn't at the Grammy's
Yeah, weird....
They had a new album out this year too.
They won best album a few years back.
Rock is dieing and they're the only ones trying to keep the ship afloat.
I can't hardly listen to the radio anymore.
Just the "oldies".
Ha! Never thought I'd be part of that croud.
We're a dying breed freind.
Too true!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do the Stones still tour.
I don't think so...
That's too bad.
Mick is an actor now?
Huh?
Well he was in the Priates movie.
Which one?
Pirates of the Carribean.
Who'd he play.
Sparrow's dad.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like going to see live rock music shows?
Yeah I do.
Who did you see live last?
I went and saw Nickelback recently.
Oh man really?
Yeah what's wrong with that?
Everything man.  Nickelback is awful.
I disagree.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think Journey is going to keep touring?
Why wouldn't they?
Well there's some drama between Neal Schon and Jonathan Cain.
But there's always drama in that band.
That's true. I want them to reunite with Steve Perry.
I doubt that will ever happen. I just want Steve's new solo record.
Wait, he's working on a solo project?
That's what he recently.
I'd buy that in a hearbeat!
Me, too! I hope his voice hasn't changed too much over the years.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Ozzy Osborne?
I only really know one song
Which one is that
Crazy train
Thats the one i know too
I really like it, i dont know why i havent listened to anything else by him
Same here
Im probably going to search some of his music
Thats a good idea
See if i like anything else by him
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard of the Arctic Monkeys?
I have. They are a great rock band.
Do you know where they are from?
They are from England, right?
Correct! They are from a town called Sheffield.
They have had a lot of success in the United States.
True! The alternative radio stations play their music all the time.
"R U Mine?" is my favorite song by the band.
That is a great one. But I prefer "Arabella"
That is an excellent song too. AM was a really fantastic album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Were you ever a Nirvana fan?
Slightly. I never got into grunge.
Yeah, but they transformed the music industry.
I wouldn't go that far.
Really, the destroyed hair rock.
Well hair bands are on their way back?
I haven't heard that.
Well, I just went to a hair band tribute band the other night. It was rockin'.
Well a tribute band is something different. It's not a legitimate band.
I still think it's legit.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just heard that the Foo Fighters are touring again.
Oh really? Are they coming to our area?
Yeah, they sure are. They'll be here in August.
We totally have to go. I've been a fan of them since The Colour and the Shape came out.
Me too. I heard Pat Smear is going to be touring with them again.
That's totally awesome. I think he's fantastic.
All the guys are, really.
That's true. They seem so genuine.
They certainly haven't let fame go to their heads.
No, not at all. I heard that Dave even drives his kids to school in a mini van!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Kings of Leon?
Absolutely. Sex on Fire is a great song.
Did you know that they are from Nashville?
I did not. Are they inspired by country music?
I have read that they are. Though they prefer rock music it sounds like.
They write some excellent guitar riffs. I certainly believe it.
My favorite song by them is Use Somebody
I love that one too!
Their last album was fantastic. Walls was a great song.
I really liked the album too. That was my favorite track on it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Ok, give me your three greatest rock songs of all time.
I'd have to say Metallica's "One" would be at the top of my list.
Me too, it's long and powerful and you feel like there's a machine gun firing next to you when you listen to it.
My number two would be Gimme Shelter by the Stones.
That's a great song dude. The background vocals are just incredible.
My number three would be Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd.
It's a little long but the way it starts off so slow and then just takes off is awesome.
Did you know those guys named their band after their high school gym teacher?
What? That's not how he spelled his name is it?
No, but they liked the way it sounded and decided to change the spelling and adopt the name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear about Chris Cornell?
I did, it's so sad.
They think it was suicide, which is just awful.
Another grunge legend gone too soon. Soundgarden were icons of that era.
Yeah, they were one of the big 4 Seattle bands in the early 90s.
What were the others? Nirvana, Pearl Jam and... ?
Alice in Chains, with Layne Staley on vocals.
Of course! I remember when he died too. So awful.
Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam is the only one still around, and he's still making music.
I love his solo stuff too - different from Pearl Jam but still great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to a lot of rock music?
I'll listen to older, classic rock.
Who do you like?
I like stuff like the Eagles and Kansas.
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah, I like the lighter stuff, nothing heavy.
The Eagles were awesome.
What was your favorite song by them?
It'd probably be Hotel California.
Yeah, that was one of their biggest hits.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think about the band Hole?
I like some of their music, like Celebrity Skin.
That song is really good.
But I like other female-lead bands better.
Oh yeah? Which ones?
Well, Garbage for one.
True. Shirley Manson is amazing.
As well as The Cardigans.
Everyone forgets that they made excellent alt rock music.
Yeah that makes me sad they get forgotten like that and only remembered for Lovefool.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Beck has been making mellow rock for us since the 90's
it's a blessing
i get that beyonce should have won the award, but beck's album was great
morning phase? oh, for sure
easily the best album he's dropped since the start of his career
i love hearing how much his music has changed over the years
yeah, it's still equally weird but way more mellow and chill
which is exactly what i need sometimes
more like all the time
heart is a drum just puts me right to sleep. thanks, beck
XXXXXXXXXXX
I can't wait to hear the next Bastille album.
I love that group! Pompeii was such a great song.
My favorite part of that track is the drum part and the backing vocals.
It was such a huge hit! I still hear it all of the time.
Do they have any other big hits?
The song "Flaws" did very well at radio for them.
I'm glad to hear they had success with more than one track.
They're a talented group. The lead singer is a great musician especially.
What is his name?
His name is Dan Smith.
XXXXXXXXXXX
One of my favorite singers of rock and roll is Elvis Presley.
Oh, I absolutely loved Elvis!  Heartbreak Hotel was one of my favorites.
He had such a beautiful voice and so good looking!  Yes, Heartbreak Hotel was a great song.
I use to have most of his records.
I had a lot of his records and played them all the time.  Rock n Roll is the best music ever.
It sure is - the music that we could hear the words and the words made sense, so unlike what the kids play now.  Elvis had so many beautiful songs that it is hard to pick my favorite.
I have quite a few favorites - Hey Jude is one of them.
Oh, yes, Hey Jude was a good one - I didn't know he recorded that song until years after his death.
That was one of the saddest days of my life.  I remember what I was doing when I heard he died.
A lot of people remember that day with so much sadness.  That reminds me of another good song - "The Day The Music Died"..
XXXXXXXXXXX
I need to hear some new music.
Have you heard of Pearl Jam?
No, what are they like?
They are a grunge band.
That sounds cool. Who is the lead singer?
Eddie Veder. He is a great singer.
Are they similar to any bands I know?
Do you know about Alice In Chains?
Yes I do. I love them.
I would check them out then. They are very similar bands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So are you a big fan of Jimi Hendrix?
Yeah, I have all his studio albums. Not the live stuff, though.
There are a lot of bootlegs and lost recordings of live shows that have come out.
Yeah, it's almost like the Grateful Dead, huh? Hippies love collecting live shows.
Hendrix in the studio was pretty fascinating, though.
I know. If you listen to "Third Stone from the Sun" there's a lot of experimental stuff going on.
Backwards tapes, stereo panning, probably an attempt to reproduce what it sounded like to be on drugs.
You mean like auditory hallucinations? Maybe.
But there are a lot of artists who created a bunch of self-indulgent noise and put it on tape, like the Red Krayola.
True! Hendrix was gifted as a pop songwriter, and that made all the difference.

Where did you first hear rock songs
Mainly when I went to my dads house for the summer as a kid. He always had this great record collection of bands
What was his favorite band
He was a big fan of Deep Purple
Deep Purple? Sounds familiar! What songs do they sing?
Their most famous song is Smoke on the Water
Oh, I know that song!
Me too, I can even play it on guitar
My favorite oldies song is Iron Man
wow that's a classic!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Does Korn still make music?
Yes I think they still tour.
They are a great rock band
They have a huge discography too
I loved Follow the Leader
Yeah Issues was my favorite by them.
They also put alot in their music videos
Thats how rock bands did it back then
Were they from California?
Yes from Orange County which is the hotbed for rock bands
XXXXXXXXXXX
Name your favorite rock band.
Metallica!
Now that's a nice choice! No Leaf Clover is probably my favorite.
That one is really good, but my favorite is Fuel.
That's quite a head banger! You don't seem like that type of person.
I sure am! The intensity of the music is gripping and I enjoy it extensively.
That is interesting. Who's your favorite band member?
It's a mix up between James and Kirk. They're both really good.
The band wouldn't be the same without James, so I've always favored him because of that.
That's logical and I agree. It wouldn't be Metallica without him!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What do you think of when you think of Rock music?
Drums, bass, really loud music, screaming, and the like.
That's so general -- rock music can refer to all kinds of things.
Oh really? Like what?
Indie rock, alternative rock, acoustic rock, christian rock -- there are so many options!
Maybe I'm thinking something more like metal.
Maybe. Do you enjoy the rock music you have listened to?
Some. It's not my favorite.
That's unfortunate. Rock music is so good!
I'll take your word for it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which decade of music had the best rock?
I would say the 1990s.
Why do you like the 1990s?  I think the classic rock of the 1970s is king.
Who is your favorite band from the 1970s?
I think the Rolling Stones is my favorite.  Songs like "Paint It Black" and "Sympathy for the Devil" made me a fan.
As silly as it sounds, I would put a band like Soundgarden's work up against the Rolling Stones.
That is blasphemy.
Hear me out.  Chris Cornell had a much better voice than Mick Jagger.
He did, but what about the rest of the Sound Garden compared to The Rolling Stones?
Well, listen to a song like "Burden In My Hand" and you will see Soundgarden's members were talented in all different areas.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock band?
I really do not have a favorite I like them all.
If you had a favorite who would you pick?
I would say Alice in Chains.
I like them, are they still playing?
I would assume so.
They were only formed in 1993.
Yeah that was before I graduated!
The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, that album was produced in 2013.
I will have to take a listen to it!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Do you have a favorite rock band?
From all time?
Yeah.
I would probably say Kiss.
Oh interesting, why them?
Well my parents listened to them a lot.  They were even in the Kiss army.
Wow that is pretty cool.
Yeah they love it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I hate current rock music.
What do you mean?
Rock music use to be about something now it's just lame.
What do you think it was about?
The 80s rocks music was about going out and having a good time.
What about 70s rock music?
It was about coming back from the war or being oppressed.
What about the 90s?
It was about being sad because it was raining outside or something.
You only listened to Nirvana in the 90s.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you listen to a lot of southern rock?
Classic southern rock?  Yeah.
Who do you like to listen to the most?
Well, lately I've been listening to the Allman Brothers.
Oh, they had some good music.  It's a shame Duane Allman died so young.
Yeah, he was an awesome musician.
What are your favorite songs by them?
I love Midnight Rider, even though that's cliche to say.
That's an awesome song.
Yeah, it's been covered a lot too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock band?
I really love Guns N Roses. Axl and Slash are a great combo.
I like Guns N Roses as well but I wish they made more songs.
So what other rock bands or artists do you listen to?
I have been listening to a lot Jimi Hendrix lately, his guitar work was really something.
Yea, I enjoy Jimi Hendrix as well and I really enjoyed his version of the star spangled banner.
Yea, it was really something special. What are your favorite songs?
Honestly, I really enjoyed Station to Station by David Bowie.
Yes, that is a really amazing song. That whole album is something awesome.
Bowie did a lot of great things, it's a shame that we recently lost him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Judas Priest?
Yes, they have some great songs.
My favorite is Hell Bent for Leather.
That is a good one.
Those guys are still touring and making music.
I remember blasting them when I was in High School.
I know, back in the mid 80's.
They has so many popular songs.
Rob Halford has an excellent voice.
He does. Funny looking, but his voice is great.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock band?
Avenged Sevenfold
Which album is your favorite?
That's tough! I enjoy most of them!
Do you like the newest one, "The Stage"?
It would be my least favorite.
What song do you think is the best?
I love so many of them. It all depends on my mood. My favorite love song is "A Little Piece of Heaven"
Is that the animated video?
Yes!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock band?
My favorite rock band is Guns and Roses?
Do you have a favorite song by them?
Yes, Paradise City is my favorite song.
What do you like most about the song?
I like the drum beat in the song.
Have you ever seen them in concert?
Yes, I saw them play in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Was it a good concert?
Yes, it was the best concert I've ever seen.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey man, nice shirt. Opeth is a great band!  What's your favorite album?
Thanks! That's a tough question.  Right now, I will say my favorite album is Blackwater Park.
Yeah, that's a good one.  What do you think of their newer stuff?
I hate their new stuff.  They try too hard to be progressive rock, but it just sucks.
Really? Well, for the most part I think you're right.  The last two albums have been pretty weak.
Yeah, I hate when bands change.  It's a complete disregard for their fans that got them to where they are today.
I disagree with that.  Bands have no reason to cater to their fans. Their music should be coming out of their souls, not to please a market.
Yeah, you're right.  Their new stuff still sucks though.  I just wish they bring back more of their older metal elements in the future.
I loved Heritage.  That's one of their best albums in my opinion, minus the first and last tracks.
Really? I hated that one.  It's way too pretentious. Well, I gotta go. Nice talk.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you think rock music has to be subversive in order to be good?
I think it plays a part, but 'good' is very subjective.
I think the really good stuff always has a political message.
Sure, but there's also a formula for it being successful.
Like Korn's song 'ya'll want a single'?
Exactly like that. There's a whole industry built on formulating how long's should be and how fast.
That detracts from the work of the artist.
Of course it does. You will notice that after they become popular and money, then the artist has more freedom to be subversive.
At that point, though, they have already become part of the system.
That's the music industry and capitalism for you. Take art and make it commercial.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who was your favorite rock band of the 80's?
By far Guns N Roses!
I agree. Appetite for Destruction was and is the best album.
What song was your favorite? Mine was, Your Crazy.
It's hard to pick just one, but I'd say, Welcome to the Jungle.
That was a great video! Axel had some crazy hair.
The drummer looked out of place, but played the drums hard.
The all played hard. Watching Slash play the guitar in person was amazing!
How many times did you see them live?
I saw them a total of three times. One time was at Lollapalooza.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So do you have a favorite band?
Sure do, Fleetwood Mac is my favorite band. Gypsy is one of my favorite songs
I love them too, my favorite is the Grateful Dead. I love Truckin.
Those were some great bands that started in the seventies. Shame that Jerry Garcia is gone.
Yes. Fleetwood Mac is still going today! Stevie Nicks sings like an angel.
I went to see them last year, the show was phenomenal.
I never saw them in person,I did see the Grateful Dead though.
That must have been an amazing show.
It certainly was!
I wish I could have seen them, I love them!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock song of the 90's?
I think I'm going to have to go with, "One Headlight" by the Wallflowers.
Yeah, that's a great song though...But a bit depressing.
Name a happier rock song from the 90's, then.
Well, "Shine" by Collective Soul is a pretty good one.
That's true! I just thought of another one that puts me in a good mood. Remember, "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by Deep Blue Something?
Oh yeah! I love that song! Are you aware of any rock bands from the 90's that are still around and releasing albums?
I know the rock band Soundgarden released one in 2011, but that is the most recent one I can think of.
I really miss rock music from the 90's. It had a touch that no other rock has.
I know exactly what you mean. It is my favorite era of rock music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So tell me, what era of rock music do you think was the best?
Well that is hard because what was considered rock was so different in differetn decades.
That is true. So who is your favorite modern rock group?
I really like Coheed and Cambria.
They are pretty good. I enjoy them.
I think that 80's rock groups with always be the best though.
Who is your favorite from around that time period?
I would say probably metallica  or KISS.
They are both kind of still around, aren't they?
I think in a way they both are.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the first edition?
Yes,Kenny rogers and the first edition is a great rock band!
What's your favorite song.
My favorite is something's burnin.
Oh I love that too.
They had a lot of hits.
Yes they did.
Are they in the hall of fame?
I don't think they are.
That's a shame. They deserve it
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like older rock?
Like 1970s rock n roll? Yes, who doesn't?
What's your favorite band from that era? Mine is probably Led Zeppelin.
I love Led Zep. It's tough to pick though - so many amazing bands.
Weren't there? Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones...
I love Creedence. My favorite is probably Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Amazing band! It's a shame all anyone knows is 'Freebird'.
Isn't it? It's a great song but there's so much more to the band.
They did that gritty Southern rock better than anyone in the 70s.
They sure did. Such an iconic, recognizable sound.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like any songs by Pearl Jam?
That's one of my favorite rock groups ever!
What's your favorite song by them?
Black. That's actually my favorite song period.
I know, mine too. It's so dark and painful but it's not hard at all to listen to like most songs that are dark.
I agree with that. Eddie Vedder has an amazing voice.
Have you ever seen the video for Jeremy?
I did and it was really disturbing but it showcased their talent.
It definitely did. If you don't know any song by them you at least know Jeremy.
That's right. I believe it was their most popular song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What genre of rock is your favorite?
I love industrial rock.
I know about industrial electronic music, but I don't know any industrial rock songs.
You probably do! Have you heard Du Hast by Rammstein or Closer by Nine Inch Nails?
Yeah, I know Du Hast. It gets me pumped whenever I hear it.
Industrial rock is like that. You should try other Rammstein if you like Du Hast.
What are some songs you think are good by them?
Sonne, Engel, and on the slower side, Wo Bist Du.
Cool. Where should I start with Nine Inch Nails?
The entire Downward Spiral album, beginning to end, in one sitting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like classic rock?
What do you consider classic rock?
You know, stuff from the 60's and 70's.
Oh - yes, I really enjoy classic rock.
Who are some of your favorite bands?
I really like The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin.
Can you tell me some of your favorite songs from The Beatles?
Sure, I really like one that is lesser known called You Won't See Me.  And another oldie, Please Mr. Postman.
Please Mr Postman was a cover by the Beatles.  Do you know who did it originally?
Maybe not originally, but I do know it was done by the Marvelettes in the 60's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who would you say is the best rock band of all time?
Aerosmith!
Oh my they are so awesome.
Who is your favorite member?
Steven Tyler of course!
I know he is so hot!
No kidding!  Especially for an older guy.
I would love to be his wife so we could hit the high notes together.
I don't want to miss a thing is my favorite song by them.
Mine too it reminds me of the movie Armageddon which I loved.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band?
Not sure, what's one of their tracks?
They did the soundtrack to Eddie and The Cruisers.
Oh I love that film and soundtrack, especially On The Darkside.
I'm partial towards Tender Years.
Do they still tour?
They do actually, have always wanted to see them.
If you hear about a nearby show, let me know.
Sure will, in the meantime going to put on some of their music.
Enjoy it! Can't believe I never knew the band's name.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Grunge rock was a great movement.
There were alot of big bands like Stone Temple Pilots.
Nirvana was the big one, but there were alot of others too.
Mud Honey was from that era.
It's interesting to see musical genres blossom and then die out.
Kind of like Rockabilly or Motown.
Grunge is a genre that still holds cache.
Even though it's era is over, the songs still play well.
Nirvana was the most well known Grunge band.
I think my favorite was Stone Temple Pilots.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the band Nirvana?
Yes, I use to listen to that alot back in the day.
I still listen to it.
You do?
Come as You are is one of my favorite songs!
I like smells like teen spirit.
They were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame.
Oh really, I didnt know that.
Yes, they were first eligible in 2014 and got inducted.
That is awesome! They deserve it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So best rock band? Led Zeppelin or the Stones?
Gotta be Led Zeppelin. Or maybe the stones? What day is it?
Gotta love the Stones. Best Stones album?
What's the one with Sympathy?
Beggars Banquet. Great album. Love in Vain.
Great song. Street Fighting Man is my favorite summer song.
Really? That's an odd choice.
What's a poor boy to do? Just love the song in the car windows open.
I think I like Exile on Main Street best. There's just so much going on there.
I love Sweet Virginia. Great country-rock song. They could play all rock. Yeah. It's Saturday's children for me today.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's that tattoo on your wrist?
It's the symbol for The Red Hot Chili Peppers band.
That's cool. Chili Peppers are an awesome band.
One of the band members has this symbol tattooed on his arm, and it's thir symbol on a lot of their cds, so I had it tattoed on my wrist.
You must really love that band.
Yeah, I listened to them all the time when I was in college in the 90s, and their music really helped me get through some crazy times.
Let me guess- that song Under The Bridge?
I love the opening guitar part on that song, and sometimes in college I did feel really lonely.
They have a lot of good sing along songs.
I know, I probably kept a lot of my dorm room mates up singing along at night while I was studying!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love Karen O!
Who is Karen O?
She is the lead singer of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
I've heard of them before! That band is great!
They are really cool. My favorite song is called Phenomena.
I don't know that song. When was it released?
It was on their 2006 album.
What is the name of the record?
It was called "Show Your Bones"
I love that title. I'm going to check that record out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
rock music has really gone down hill
you think?
yeah! every time i turn on the rock station it's just bad song after bad songs
i guess you're right. sometimes i find myself thinking...is this even rock anymore?
i guess anything can be rock. they think the fray is rock
i think pop rock should just...stop existing as a genre
yeah, more people should be like portuglar, the man. tame impala. you know?
real musicians, real artists
rihanna did a really cool tame impala cover, though. you won't hear me complaining about that
oh yeah, that was pretty lit
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever played the game Rock Band? It's sick, they have a controller now that has strings like an actual guitar.
I have not, tell me more about it man. I really love rock music!
Well, not only can you play the guitar, but there's also a microphone for vocals, a drum set, a keyboard, and a bass guitar.
Man, that's so sick! Do you have the game at your house?
Yeah, I do actually, and you'll be surprised to know that a lot of your favorite bands have songs in the game.
Really? Like, what bands have songs in that game?
A lot dude, to name a few, Green Day, Nirvana, Metallica, Aerosmith, Megadeth, and AC/DC.
Bro, I'm coming over your house today. I'll do vocals, trust me, I'm a good singer.
We'll see about that man! What time do you want to come over?
Around four o'clock, I'll be ready to rock and roll after I pick my sister up from school!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite Aerosmith song?
I like Big 10 Inch record.
That's a fun one. I like Walk This Way.
Steven Tyler has such a cool voice.
He does and I like how unique his sound is.
He has really aged well.
I know he has. He still looks really young.
Not only that, but his vocals are still good.
Not bad for a guy who is 69.
He's been lucky.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I was listening to one of my favorite songs on the way over.
What's that?
Here I Go Again.
By Whitesnake right?
Yes.
Good song.
I loved Saints and Sinners. Great album.
It was. They had a lot of good songs.
Yes, the 80's had so many good rock bands.
It did.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is AC/DC still touring?
I think so.
I didn't much care for thier last album.
It was a little weak. What was it called?
Black Ice.
That's right.
They're getting a little long in the tooth....
Hey! Old guys rock too.
Settle down there old fella!
Why I aughta...!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Everyone always gives Nickelback such a hard time.
I kind of do too.  I really don't like them.
They're really not bad though.
I guess they aren't bad.  For me, I just don't like modern rock too much.
Well, why does everyone hate them?
I think it's more of a bandwagon thing.
Like your friend hates them, so you do too?
Yeah.  It just becomes fun to laugh at them.
I don't really see the sense in that.  it's good music.
I mean, if you think so, you should keep listening.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wonder why you don't hear too much rock music on the radio these days.
Well you do hear Coldplay and Imagine Dragons sometimes.
That's true, but I'm really more into alternative stuff.
You mean like Pearl Jam or Kaiser Chiefs?
I really liked the last Fleet Foxes album, but I don't hear that on the radio.
Well they're a bit indie, aren't they?
That's true. I guess you have to be on a big label.
Pretty much. But there are good rock bands on the radio.
Like who, though?
The Killers and the Red Hot Chili Peppers still get airplay.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you heard the new Green Day album?
Revolution Radio?
That's the one.
Just the one song that keeps playing on the radio.
Bang Bang.
I think so.
That's my favorite track.
Any other good ones.
Most of them are pretty good.
I just might have to buy it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's a good rock band to get into?
Pearl Jam is really good and they have a lot of material.
How long have they been around for?
I don't know exactly but it's over 25 years now.
Wow, do they still have all of their original members?
All except for the drummer. They've had a few drummer but the most recent one has been with them for a while now.
What was their first album?
Their first big album was called Ten, it came out in 1991.
What is the name of Pearl Jam's singer?
His name is Eddie Vedder. He's very well known and is known as a big 90's grunge icon but they're not really grunge. That was just a label they gave almost every 90's band.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What was the name of that first guy, before Mike Patton?
You mean in Faith No More? Chuck Moseley.
Yeah, that dude. I keep hearing how good the first two albums are, but I can't get past his voice.
It's a bit of a barrier, isn't it. It always sounds like he's got a head cold.
Yeah, I guess so. I was wondering if it was just my preconceptions, because I was so used to Mike Patton and... well, you know what his voice is like.
No, it's not just you. I'd like to hear most of Introduce Yourself with Patton on the vocals; it'd be a lot like The Real Thing, I think.
I wouldn't go that far. Then again, I haven't been able to really pay attention to the music.
I think it's reasonable; The Real Thing was mostly written with Chuck Moseley in mind. Mike Patton strolled in with basically a completed album, and sang the words in front of him.
Oh, God. I can't fathom how that would have sounded -- all those epic anthems and things.
I can sort of hear it with "Epic," speaking of. Maybe "Underwater Love"?
XXXXXXXXXXX
So, check it, I watched this documentary the other day on Quiet Riot.
Oh, man, there's a name I haven't heard in awhile.
Yeah, I know!  Love their song "Cum On Feel the Noize".
That brings me back... I used to listen to that as a kid a lot.
Me too.  So, anyway the documentary is about the band's drummer and the history of the band, and how he's trying to reform in current times.
Oh, did they succeed in that?
Yes, sort of.  The lead singer died from a drug overdose, so they had to hold a audition to replace him.
Oh, I bet that didn't make a lot of the fans happy.
Yeah, they mention that in the documentary, and even really a powerful scene where the guy interviews the leader singer's mom and gets her permission to do it.
It sounds pretty good, I'll have to look it up!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I wish rock music was the same as it used to be.
I know!  What happened to the days of Nirvana and Soundgarden?
Aren't both of those lead singers dead?
They are.  And that is a terrible tragedy.  They would be embarrassed by the songs on the radio today.
I'm sure.  Who wants to listen to rap songs all the time that repeat words the whole song?
I know.  I just put in my Silverchair CD and ignore mainstream radio.
Sirius makes that so much easier.  Did you know that Pearl Jam even has their own radio station now?
Really?  Does it only play Pearl Jam songs?
It does.  But a lot of it is the live stuff that you haven't heard.  It's awesome.
I'm going to have to check that out.
XXXXXXXXXXX
So what you up to
Just practicing and having fun
Doing what
We got a rock show tonight
Who you going to see
Oh we are not going
What do you mean
I am opening for a big rock band
Who is it
I am opening for Black Fast
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you remember the rock band Skid Row?
Yes that guy could scream.
My best song was 18 and Life to go. What was yours?
I liked I Remember You.  That guy Sebastien had a voice didn't he?
One of the best. Did you like Heart?
Them sisters made some good music.
Remember Barracuda?  Everyone played that on the guitar.
We used to sing that song while driving in my friends Barracuda.
I remember that, Ann and Nancy Wilson were their names right?
Yes and we went to their concert in L.A. too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you hear the Foo Fighters just announced a new album?
I think I did see that. What is the album name again?
Concrete and Gold.
Right. Yeah, I did hear about that and also the new tour too.
I'm excited. It seems like there just isn't much new rock music lately.
Yeah, they're definitely one of the few bands around right now to keep the genre alive.
Yeah, they're definitely the biggest rock band around currently, in my opinion.
I agree with that. Aside from maybe The Rolling Stones but the Stones don't really put out any new music.
Yeah, they just tour mostly.
At least they're all still iconic though!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Is Nickelback really that bad?
No.  It's just kind of fun to trash them.
So many people have made fun of them over the years.
They're kind of a punchline, but there's tons of bands that are worse.
I think the lead singer married that one girl.
What one girl?
You remember Avril Lavigne?
You're kidding me.  The 'Sk8er Boy' chick?
That's the one.
Small world I guess.  Isn't he way too old for her?
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is a good, heavy rock band to listen to?
Do you like Metallica? They're pretty awesome.
Yeah but I don't like their newer stuff. They're a completely different band these day than from their early days.
That's for sure. After The Black album, they completely changed their sound.
Yeah, they went from a metal band to more of a hard rock band. Nothing they do now sounds like Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets.
I guess when musicians get older it's difficult to maintain the same intensity as when they were younger and angrier.
Their newer album, Hardwired sounds a little like their early albums. It reminds me of Kill 'Em All.
I've heard a couple song off of that album and yeah, it's better than most of their post-Black album music.
I think when Jason Newsted left the band is when they really went downhill. Maybe even after Cliff Burton died.
I'd almost agree about them changing after Cliff Burton died but And Justice For All was a pretty heavy album. That was the last good album from Metallica though.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I heard a Rush song on the radio today.
Yeah, which one?
Tom Sawyer.
I like their old stuff like that. Their new stuff not so much.
After like Grace Under Pressure I wasn't into them any more.
Exit Stage Left is still one of the best live albums.
True--Jacob's Ladder is a great song.
Best song on there, man.
Their first album was good.
Indeed--Working Man, good song.
XXXXXXXXXXX
My sister loves the singer of Buck Cherry.
Really. You mean the dirty looking guy?
Yes. His name is Josh Todd.
Doesn't seem like it would be his name. The tattoos really throw you off with him.
Yes, but appearances don't mean anything.
You're right. He does sing good.
Crazy Bitch is a fantastic song. How could someone not like it.
It is a catchy song.
The album called Rock "N" Roll was pretty good.
If you have it, maybe I could listen to it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Portugal The Man is kind of badass
You're right
They made a sick burn about all the industrialized music lately. Reminding people that at least they still play instruments!
HA! I guess most bands don't these days.
Not really!
Is their music any good?
Oh yeah! You should listen to Feel It Still. It's honestly a bop
Maybe I will.
and if you're not a fan? you're not a fan of rock music. I don't make the rules.
Harsh
XXXXXXXXXXX

What year did they form?
1978
Who was the bands first singer?
Stephen Duffy
Who replaced Stephen Duffy?
Simon Lebon
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like red hot chili peppers?
Yes, they are a good group.
I really liked them in the 90s.
What is your favorite song from that group?
Favorite song was Californication.
I haven't heard that song before, but I'm sure it is good.
You should go to youtube and listen to it.
I will do that later today.
Talking about that group brings back memories.
Yes the good times when we were young.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band is the moat heavy?
ACDC
Is that the band with Angus?
Yes and Malcolm and Bon Scott, who was later replaced by Brian Johnson.
Who do you like more between Scott and Johnson?
Bon Scott. But, they are both really good at singing.
What is your favorite song?
Highway to Hello
I like TNT
That is a great one too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like new rock?
Not really. I prefer the classics.
Like who?
I like Nirvana and Pearl Jam.
They are great.
I agree.
What is a Nirvana song you like?
Lithium
That's a very heavy song
Yeah, I like the melody a lot.
XXXXXXXXXXX
You ever get into Blink 182?
Yeah, they were alright.
Did you know that System of a Down covered one of their songs?
Which one?
Dammit.
That was one of their better diddys.
System of a Down totally changed it up.
How so?
Slowed it way down and used an acoustic guitar.
Interesting.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is the best part of rock music to you?
I would have to say the guitarists. They do stuff that no other genre can hope to match.
What do you mean?
People can usually tell what a particular song is by the guitar riff alone. No other genre can do that.
That's true. U2's "New Year's Day" is a good example of that.
I love that song, but I'm not so sure about their new work.
You're right. It's not as iconic as their earlier stuff.
It depends. I like "Beautiful Day," but not "Vertigo."
I feel the same way.
Want to play a game of "Name That Song?"
XXXXXXXXXXX
What's your favorite rock group?
I really like Foo Fighters.
I do too, though I'm more into their older hits.
Like Everlong and My Hero?
Yeah, their newer stuff isn't as good to me.
Like stuff newer than Learn to Fly?
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
Yeah, I feel the same way about Foo Fighters' music.
Do you also like Red Hot Chili Peppers too then?
They're my favorite band!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What kind of rock music do you prefer
Are there more than one kind of rock?
I mean metal, alternative, punk. Between those, what do you like?
I'm a big fan of heavy metal
oh, me too! what bands do you listen to?
I'm a fan of Slipknot
Wow, are you serious? I saw them in Concert!
Wow when did you see them?
In 2015 at the Rock AM ring
I'm so jealous!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
Would you call yourself a fan of rock?
Yeah I would.
Do you have a favorite band these days?
Like a newer band?
Yeah sure.
I really like St. Paul and the Broken Bones.
Would you call that rock?
Yeah they are a little bit.  A little bit soul too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Are you a fan of old school rock bands?
Like Nirvana?
No, like old school for real, like The Who.
Who are the Who?
The band, they sing "Who are You".
Oh, I did not know that. I think I like them then.
They have hits spanning decades.
Well, I think I will have to look into them.
Look into the Ramones too, you might like them.
You know a lot of old rock bands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I'm glad the British Invasion happened.
Me too. It brought out some of the best rock music ever.
Led Zeppelin led the pack in that era.
I liked The Who.
Didn't The Who make a musical?
Yes, it was called "Tommy".
My favorite Who song is Eminence Front.
That was one of the few songs that Roger Daltrey wasn't the lead singer on.
All in all I still think Led Zeppelin had more hits than The Who.
I think that you are right about that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
The question is, classic rock or contemporary rock?
Oh, classic rock, all the way.
Like the Eagles?
Yes - the Rolling Stones, U2 . . .
Though some may not call them rock music.
Well, even if some folks don't call them rock, they have influenced a lot of rock music.
That's true. Speaking of who influenced rock and roll . . .
Elvis Presley, the King of Rock and Roll!
I wish I could have been to one of his concerts, back in the day.
He had such an awesome voice!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Which singer of Van Halen do you prefer?
David Lee Roth is my favorite.
I preferred Sammy Hagar.
I did love 5150, but Roth is still my favorite.
What's your favorite tune of theirs?
I love "Dreams"
That is a great one.
What's your favorite?
I love "Little Dreamer"
That's a great one too!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I love The Clash!
They're awesome! The song "Train In Vain" is one of my favorites.
That one is great. I am also a big fan of "London Calling"
Was Joe Strummer in The Clash?
He was! Along with Mick Jones.
What a great combination. They are great musicians.
They were part of the original wave of British Punk.
I think that they formed way back in 1976.
It is amazing that their music still holds up.
Great music always does!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who do you think was the best band of the 90's?
The Smashing Pumpkins
I do not remember them
They are great
What is a song of theirs?
1979
Cool, do you like The Offspring?
Yes, they are cool
What is your favorite song from them?
Self Esteem
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you been to any concerts lately?
Yes! I went to see Otep the other day.
I don't think I know who that is. Would I know them?
Probably not, they're pretty heavy. How about you? Any concerts lately?
I went to see Seether a couple weeks ago, I love them!
Ooo, they are good. Shaun Morgan is a great songwriter.
Yes, he is. Have you listened to the new album?
I think I've heard a song or two. What's your favorite on it?
I love the song Saviours, it's about people who are desperate for attention on social media.
That's great! I saw the cover they did of that Thrice song, Black Honey, it sounded great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
I got an extra ticket to see Iron Maiden this weekend. Do you wanna go?
Iron Maiden! Yeah I wanna go. They're fantastic.
I know! I hope they play Empire of Clouds from their new album, Book of Souls! Its so epic!
Didn't Bruce Dickinson write that one?
Yeah, he did. He's a great songwriter. Have you heard any of his solo work?
A few songs, but I'm less familiar with his solo stuff.
I recommend the album The Chemical Wedding. Its so good.
I'll have to check it out. You know, I heard that Bruce Dickinson is also a pilot.
Yeah! He usually flies the band around when they're on tour too!
Awesome! I've heard the plane is Iron Maiden themed too! I'd love to see it in person.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
Do you like listening to rock music?
Yeah I like it a lot.
What era of rock do you like?
I love rock from the 70's.  It's the best.
Why do you like that time period?
It's when all the great bands first came on the scene.
Like who.
Led Zeppelin, Bad Company, bands like that.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I am super glad to have discovered the band White Reaper.
Who is White Reaper, I haven't heard of them.
A garage rock band that is kind of similar to early stuff by The Strokes.
Okay now you have my attention.
Their latest album The World's Best American Band has album of the year potential.
I like when bands have funny titles for their albums.
Same, even better when they can back it up with great tunes.
Is it the album on Spotify?
Yeah, my favorite song is called The Stack, it's so catchy.
I'll listen to it and let you know what I think tonight.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band do you like a lot?
I really like The Smashing Pumpkins.
Are they still around? I thought they stopped a long time ago.
No, they're still around but almost all of the original members are gone. It's just the singer, Billy Corgan who's left from the original lineup.
Well that doesn't really sound like they're still around if it's only one member.
Billy Corgan wrote almost all of their music and even mostly played all the instruments on their albums so in theory it should not sound any different with other members.
So so they sound the same as they did in the 90's?
Weirdly, no, they don't sound like they did in the 90's. Their newer albums aren't all bad, Moment To An Elegy is a pretty good album, but it's still not as good as their older stuff.
Is there any chance of a reunion with all of the original members?
I've read in the news that they have spoken to each other and are getting along these days so it's definitely a possibility. Actually James Iha played a few shows with Billy Corgan and The Smashing Pumpkins recently.
XXXXXXXXXXX
have you ever heard of warren zevon?
maybe, but i can't place the name
zevon wrote werewolves of london
I totally know that song!
its a classic
who besides zevon do you think plays awesome rock piano?
elton john has got to rank high on that list
I agree. rocket man is excellent
who else makes that list?
fats domino. that is going back close to the beginnings of rock and roll!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like to listen to rock music?
Yes! All of the time my friend.
What is your favorite song?
I love Good Times Roll.
By The Cars?
Yeah.
Oh they are so classic.
Yeah they put me in a good  mood all of the time.
Same for me.
I had a nice time talking to you.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to rock music?
I listen to it all of the time.
What artist?
John Mayer.
Oh come on, he is not really rock.
I consider him to be rock though.
What song do you like by him?
Daughters.
That song is sweet.
That is why I like it.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like older rock music?
It depends on what you mean by older. The 80's or 90's?
I guess the 80's. Do you like Guns and roses?
Sure some of their songs are great. I like Metallica though.
Oh yeah! That one song about the sandman was amazing.
Oh, you mean Enter Sandman. I think that was the name.
Yeah that's probably it. What about the 90's bands?
Sure some of it. I like Pearl Jam.
I think Pearl Jam is still around.
Really, I wonder how bands stay together so long.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band do you listen to most often?
That would have to be Stone Sour!
They are pretty good, though I have a hard time with some of their songs.
What do you mean by that?
Some of the songs are really depressing and talk about giving up on everything.
That is quite the point of their House of Gold and Bones albums.
Yes, it seems so. Why do you like them?
It's the deep thoughts and inner darkness that the music produces which draws me.
Maybe you have depression issues?
No, that's just all part of the enjoyment in some rock music.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like 90s rock?
Of course, grunge was very influential!
There will never be another band like Nirvana, that's for sure, but Soundgarden was just as good.
Shame about Chris Cornell, he had a really powerful voice.
He had one of the best voices in rock. He wasn't grunge, but Mike Patton is up there!
I know! He's awesome, but too many people will only know him for Epic and not for his actual variety.
Yup, incredible range. He can scream in one song, croon like Frank Sinatra in another, and he's even done an opera album.
He's fluent in Italian and always wants to experiment, so that's no surprise.
You really should check out Mondo Caine, since that's his opera album.
Thank you, I will!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever listened to Rush?
Rush, are you kidding, that is my favorite band of all time!
Whoa, really?  They are mine too, they are incredible and have been around forever.
I have seen them in concert over 20 times!
I've seen then nine times, and that is not enough for sure.  They are so talented.
You know, my favorite album is "All The World's A Stage", Bytor is so cool played live
I agree, but I have to say I am a huge fan of Moving Pictures and no, not because of "Tom Sawyer"!
Hey, I'm glad to hear that because I was thinking maybe you were a "fake" fan that knew the three radio friendly songs and that's it.
Are  you kidding, Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, now that's what I'm talking about on Moving Pictures
Ok, I see you do know your Rush, hey, let's go listen to Hemispheres!
XXXXXXXXXXX
What rock band is great live?
Nirvana was awesome.
You saw them live?
Yes. Kurt Cobain sounded great.
Are they your favorite band?
Yes, probably. I bought all of their CD's when I was a kid.
I like "About a Girl'
That is a classic one
Did they have a CD with a baby on the cover?
Yes. That is one of their more popular CD's.
XXXXXXXXXXX
How great of a track is Hey Jude
Its like The Beatles just knew how to write music
Oh they definitely did.
They are the definitive rock band.
They have a diverse catalog to be honest.
I wish they still made new music
It would be hard considering how old they are now.
I dont think you ever forget how to write songs
Yeah but you cant make them relevant
They are a different group of people though
XXXXXXXXXXX
shuggie by foxygen is such a classic
i've never heard it
really? foxygen is easily one of the most iconic indie bands of all time!
i think i know the name
you might know them from a song called lariat. they namedropped the band, so even if you haven't heard the awesome that is foxygen you might know the name...
can you hum a little tune for me?
no way! if you don't know shuggie, you probably don't know a foxygen song
it sounds like oxygen
i think it's a play on words. shuggie is great, though. just listen to the drum line real quick
you're right, that's pretty kickin'
XXXXXXXXXXX
I miss the hair bands of the eighties.
Who was your favorite hair band?
I really like the shock rockers.
Which ones in particular?
Twisted Sister was my favorite.
I liked them too, were there any others?
Yes, I was big into Alice Cooper and Wasp.
I loved Alice Cooper!
Yes, I saw him in concert twice!
What's your favorite song of his?
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you see Metalica at the Grammys?
Yeah, hillarious!
Hetfield was so mad!
He threw his guitar off stage after the performance.
I totally missed that!
Gaga seemed pretty happy though.
I'll be she was.
The mic all to herself.
I thought it was going to be terribl.
It was! That's why it was so great!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like Guns N' Roses a lot?
Yes, they are a great band.
Who is their singer?
Axel Rose
Does he have a good voice?
Yes, one of the best voices ever.
Do you think Slash is the greatest guitarist?
Yes, of all time
What is their best album?
Appetite for Destruction
XXXXXXXXXXX
Who is the greatest rock band of all time?
Is that a question or statement?
Oh, haha.  Yeah, the Who is pretty great, but I don't know if I'd say they're the greatest.
There are a lot of contenders, but my vote goes with Led Zeppelin.
I would definitely agree with that-- I loved how their sound evolved.
Yeah, they started with a very bluesy sound, and ended up being a precursor to heavy metal.
What's your favorite Zeppelin song?
I'm going to go with the Rain Song.
Great choice.  Best Album?
I'll say Led Zeppelin 4, also known as untitled, sometimes wrongly referred to as Zoso.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey.
Hi.
What was the last rock band you saw?
Like live?
Yeah.
I saw Tedeschi Trucks band not too long ago.
I heard they were pretty good live.
Yeah it wasn't bad.
Was Derek Trucks killing it on guitar.
Yeah always.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Did you ever see The Doors?
They were way before my time.
I meant the movie.
The one with Val Killmer?
That's the one.
Yeah, pretty great flick.
Jim Morrison died so young.
Seems to be the way of the rock star.
Not all of them.
That generation was dropping like flys!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to rock at all?
I love listening to Joan Jett.
Do you listen to Bad Reputation?
Yeah I was just about to say that is my favorite song.
She was so iconic. I miss artists like her.
Yeah and she was great in concert.
Oh you are so lucky you got to go see her.
Yeah it was something I will not forget.
I loved talking to you!
Same, let us do this again!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Lynard Skynard was from Alabama.
Yes. They used to record there too.
How do your know?
I watched a documentary about the studio where The Swampers used to record.
Who are they?
They were a backup band and they used to backup Lynard Skynard.
They are mentioned in one of Skynard's songs.
Sweet Home Alabama.
I remember that song. It was great.
The Swampers played backup for that song too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music?
I  love rock music
So do you have any favorite rock bands?
Yes I do, I like Bon Jovi and Aerosmith
I like them too, in fact they are my favorite bands as well.

Well I like the touch drums add to the song but I like the electric guitar too.
Oh I see have you gone to any good rock concerts lately?
No, actually I havent but I want to dough.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I Prevail is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands.
Oh, I like them too. Have you heard their remake of Blank Space?
I love that song! It's far better than the original.
They have another recent song, My Heart I surrender, that is awesome too. So moving but still hard rock.
I haven't heard that one. What other bands do you listen to?
I like Disturbed as well.
I'm not a big Disturbed, but their remake of the Sound of Silence was amazing. I didn't realize his voice was that amazing.
Oh I know. That song is so much different than anything they've put out in the past.
I'll always be a fan of Breaking Benjamin and Shinedown.
I like both of them too. I love I'll Follow You by Shinedown. I listen to it everyday.
XXXXXXXXXXX
It bums me out how long it takes Tenacious D to put out albums.
I agree, Rize of the Fenix was a super funny album.
Most of all I miss album releases because I miss seeing them live.
Yeah album releases, besides the abundance of new tracks, always bring on the tour which you and I love.
I love how even though they're somewhat of a joke rock band, they can still genuinely rock.
Oh totally, Jack Black has a great voice and Kyle Gass can shred.
It's even better when they get Dave Grohl to guest on drums.
Him as the devil in Pick of Destiny was a great treat.
What's your favorite Tenacious D song?
It's a tough choice and maybe it's a generic choice but Wonderboy.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I just discovered The Mars Volta and my life will never be the same.
Wow, are they still together?
I think so. Their last album was in 2012, though.
So how have they changed your life?
I just never realized rock music could be this sort of artistic and epic.
Progressive rock is like that! You should listen to more.
What kind of progressive rock band is like The Mars Volta?
Pink Floyd, for starters.
Hm, what about something with a more modern sound?
Try Tool, or Swans, or Radiohead.
XXXXXXXXXXX

Hard to say, who'd have to be more specific like what's my favorite heavy metal band.
Okay, so what's your favorite heavy metal band?
That would have to be Metallica.
Okay, I can see that. What are some of your favorite Metallica song?
Well, Ride the Lighting is one.
That is a good one, but what about Master of Puppets?
I love that one! My Metallica t-shirt has the cover from that album on it!
Okay, so you are a very big fan.
Not a "camp out for a week to get tickets" type of fan, but a pretty good fan.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, did you go see Weezer's recent show?
Oh yeah, it was awesome.
Really? I thought they aren't so good live.
Oh no, they did a sweet rendition of Surf Wax America mashed up with Holiday.
That sounds like it would be really weird.
It kind of was, but it sounded fantastic. They also played El Scorcho and Say It Ain't So.
Did they play newer music too?
Of course. They played Beverly Hills.
What do you think of their new hit about summer?
Feels Like Summer? I love the melody.
XXXXXXXXXXX
What is your favorite rock bank?

They are amazing. Favorite song?
Has to be Hotel California.
Yes! That is a classic.
That and Take It Easy.
Glenn Frey is so talented.

The Eagles and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Who doesn't know Sweet Home Alabama?

What kind of music do you listen to?
I love rock music
Me too
Its really the best genre
Yes it is
I've been listening to it for forever
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like rock music from around the world?
I'm not that familiar with bands outside of the US. Do you recommend anything?
I love rock music from Japan, there are so many great guitar players like Tak Matsumoto from B'z and Syu from Galneryus.
Wow! You sound pretty knowledgeable. What do B'z sound like?
Well, they're one of Japan's biggest rock band, they've been around since the '80s. They're kind of like a Japanese Aerosmith with more hard elements.
That sounds fun! I have heard of Babymetal, are they similar?
Not really, but Babymetal is still fun. They're almost like a typical JPop band that uses metal as the set dressing.
Interesting! I didn't know that. Haven't they been on tour in the US?
Yes, they went on tour with Rob Zombie. Actually, B'z have toured the US too.
Wow, I didn't know that. I have to look into more Japanese bands.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hey, can I have my Alkaline Trio cd back?
Oh yeah, totally I'm sorry.
No big deal. I just don't want to forget it,

Yes, what's your favorite?
Probably, Good Mourning.I used to listen to that on repeat all the time.
XXXXXXXXXXX
I remember Queen, do you?
Yes where were they from?
They were a British rock band.
The song We Will Rock You was a big hit.
It still is.  It's one of their top songs.
Didn't the singer die?
Yes he died awhile back.
Thats too bad, he had a good voice.
I liked the song Bohemian Rhapsody.
That was an original, one of a kind.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi

Do you like Cake?
Eating cake?
No, the band.  Have you ever heard of them?
Oh, yeah!  I had one of their CDs back in high school.
Me too!  Which one did you have?
I think it was called "Prolonging the Magic."  There was a picture of a pig on the case.
I think that was the one I had, but I'm not sure.
I know that the biggest song on it was "Never There."
I don't know.  I think I had the one with "The Distance."
I think that was another album.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the Strokes?
I absolutely have! They are one of my favorite rock bands.
Are they coming out with a new album anytime soon?
I hope so! They had an EP that came out last year and I heard they are recording a new album right now.
Reptilia was such a good song. I hope they have another track like that on their next release.
I hope so too. I am sure that Albert Hammond Jr. has been working hard on new songs.
Is he the frontman of the band?
He certainly is. He is the singer. He also produces music for other bands.
That's really cool. I bet that he is an excellent producer because of all that he knows about songwriting.
You're probably right. I am sure the bands that he works with are lucky to have him.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you ever listen to Lynard Skynryd?
If I hear them on the radio.
So you aren't a fan of theirs?
Not really, but I do like to listen to southern rock sometimes.
Do you like Freebird?
I have to be in the mood to listen to that one.
What do you mean?
It's just really long and if you aren't in the right mood, it's just now fun to listen to.
I get what you mean.  Do you listen to CCR?
I listen to them about as much as Lynnard Skynyrd.  My dad used to love CCR.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Do you like the band Queens of the Stone Age?
I do! I love their song No One Knows.
Dave Grohl did the drumming for that band didn't he?
Yes and he was excellent in that song. The drums really stood out.
Wasn't he with Nirvana for a little while also.
Yes and he was the front man for The Foo Fighters.
Oh I love them! They have a new video out that features them rocking out in a nursing home.
I've seen it. It's hilarious and it really fits their playful style.
I agree with that. Dave Grohl is one of the remaining legends of our time.
I'm going to go listen to some Queens of the Stone age right now!
XXXXXXXXXXX
Have you ever heard of the band Wishbone Ash?
I think I have.
They were a seventies band.

There's so many.  "Keep pushin'" is one of them.
What are other Reo songs you like?
"Don't let him go" is awesome too.
Are there any others that really stand out to you?
"Roll with the changes" is another very upbeat song both on words and in the beat.
Are there any slwo songs they did that you like?
"I can't fight this feeling" is a good song too.
XXXXXXXXXXX
Hi.
Hey.
